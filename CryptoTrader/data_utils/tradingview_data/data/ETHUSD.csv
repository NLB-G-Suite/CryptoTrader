What's up traders, I hope you're all having a good trading week so far. Let's get straight into it! 

Ethereum -0.06%  is trading right on a side-wards resistance structure at 606, and has been trading at this level since 3rd June. Price is trading upwards along a side-wards support line, which has now converged into the side-wards resistance line. Price is at a juncture, and price needs to either break upwards, and break downwards. 

Supporting the upside, there is a side-wards support line thats recently formed, if price stays above this line, it will mean price is forced to break the side-wards resistance at 612.  

If price breaks the support  trend line , then we can expect some downside. If price breaks the support  trend line , AND also hits the side-wards  resistance level , then it is a good sell opportunity. 

There is 2 outcomes for  Ethereum -0.06%  in the short term. They are: 

- If price goes below 597.65 and closes there, then I am expecting downside to continue to 497.40 (Where there is some localized structure which could act as support) or the lower horizontal  support zone  at 364.00. 
- Price stays above 597.65 and breaks out of the side-wards resistance. If this happens, there will be a retest on the side-wards resistance line turned support and then break to the upside. 

Please show your support and leave a like and follow - I'd really appreciate it! :-)

 ETHUSD -0.06%  update: The slow grind is a pleasant market to watch if you are managing positions over the long term. If you are trying to open a new position, it can be very hard to watch because it can turn at any point, but slowly continues higher. What is not obvious is the risk of retrace which I will talk more about in this report. 

Price is about to retest the 625 resistance (.382 of recent  bearish  swing). This level has previously proven to attract selling activity. The question is do these bears return? The higher low established at 575 indicates that price is more likely to push higher, but this is where the risk of retrace comes into play. 

The 641 reversal zone boundary is relative to the 628 high and is the area to watch for  bearish  formations IF a fake out is in order for these markets.  

Keep in mind, this is not a prediction, it is a scenario to be prepared for. If the newly established  bullish trend line  stays intact, this market may be on its way to a new high and a decisive close above the 628 level. This will change the short term outlook from  bearish  to  bullish .  

At S.C., we are not taking any new swing trade longs because price is too close to resistance levels. We would rather miss the low probability trade, even if it works out this time. We know that in the long run, the same trade would produce inconsistent results and that is not in line with our goal. 

Our plan is to wait for better prices which means a retest of 575 would have to happen. If price continues higher, then we will be evaluating for the next swing trade long opportunity.

ETH has a couple spikes in bear  volume  the last couple days that have hindered the bulls a bit.  
ETH has a bit more work to do to be as close to daily continuation as  BTC -0.63%  is.  
The ETHBTC chart is getting extremely tight with 3 daily inside bars. Watch this chart for the break.  
Bulls need to see continuation today, and the ETH chart is much more split than  BTC -0.63%  which favors bulls.  
Some hourly inside bars to watch here for short term direction.

This is almost exactly the same post as my BTCUDSD post for the day.  An indicator that I like to use to help see through the noise is the Hull  MACD , which is a difficult indicator to use because they are not a lot of resources on it.  But generally a  bearish  cross is a  bearish  cross.  I highlighted in yellow what the H-MACD looks like when you are moving through a bubble and we certainly don't see that behavior.  In other words, this  bearish  cross will tend to bring the prices down. We may see this  bearish  cross on the H-MACD cause some convergence on the normal  MACD  leading to a  bearish  cross there, which I have highlighted a previous example in blue.    

Additionally the 1h chart has some  bearish  divergence setting in.   This peak is lower than the last and we had to get the  bearish  divergence to do this.  The overall sentiment has not been enough to give this upswing any real momentum.  This isn't quite enough for me to go short but I am thinking about it.  But both the micro and  daily charts  look poor enough that my optimism has turned to neutral (at the very best).

First had a downtrending channel, recently price broke out of this channel, but finds it hard to break clearly. 
Matching up a zone of resistance and an area that looks like a double shoulder head and shoulder pattern, price is more likely to go down and test the lows for a potential bottom in the market. 

Conclusion: View is neutral until it either breaks the 630 or 490 barrier. Shorter term views, a more negative outlook, maybe price will retest at 630 and then drop off.

Something different. No indicators. Just looking at price action on different time frames and looking for areas of previous activity. 

There's a lot going on here at first glance but it's not that crazy when you dive in. I started by looking at the most recent price movement. Here is the 1 hour chart for eth starting in April. We get a 5 wave structure up with the horizontal lines showing the top and the bottom of our current channel. We're looking for a corrective wave two that doesn't retrace 1 by more than 100 percent. If it does we look for a different count. 

So the current story becomes, is the 2 in? Here I have labeled a theory that says, yes, yes it is.  Doesn't mean it's true. 

Here's my thought process; the move down could be counted as a 12345 which would make it the A, then B bounces up to 550 or so, and then C corrects down below A meaning eth dips below 500 again. This would certainly still be a valid count but I started to look at areas with lots of price action recently and saw two channels. Our current channel in green and the previous channel in red. In blue are the time frames where the price shifted from one channel to the other. I suspect a third one to be coming soon. There's just so much price history in these areas that I think it's likely to return there. There are psychological and mathematical reasons for this but that discussion is for another time but I'll summarize by stating a true trope: Markets have memories. 

Is it possible that we break  bearish  out of the current channel? Most definitely. And it very well may. There are some funky waves to interpret and I'm sure different  Elliott  traders will see things differently. 

I'm looking from different perspectives to try to carve out the narrative.

The price is below the green ascending  trend line . The possible ways for  Ethereum -0.06%  are the following: 
1.	Red scenario ( bearish ). ETH/USD will move towards the closest  support area  at $596.08 and break through it targeting the next  support area  at $566.90. 
2.	Orange scenario (neutral).  Ethereum -0.06%  will stay within the current range, limited by the  support area  at $596.08 and the closest  resistance area  at $626.66 without significant price changes. 
3.	Green scenario ( bullish ). The currency pair will break through $626.66 targeting the next  resistance area  at $662.39, which coincides with the 1 retracement level.

 Ethereum -0.06%  is still consolidating between  support and resistance  areas. 

The possible scenarios remain the same as yesterday since there was almost no change in price. 
If price breaks the resistance, it will likely continue up to the flip zone around $700.

What's up traders, I hope you're all having a good trading week so far. Let's get straight into it! 

Ethereum -0.06%  is trading right on a side-wards resistance structure at 606, and has been trading at this level since 3rd June. Price is trading upwards along a side-wards support line, which has now converged into the side-wards resistance line. Price is at a juncture, and price needs to either break upwards, and break downwards. 

Supporting the upside, there is a side-wards support line thats recently formed, if price stays above this line, it will mean price is forced to break the side-wards resistance at 612.  

If price breaks the support  trend line , then we can expect some downside. If price breaks the support  trend line , AND also hits the side-wards  resistance level , then it is a good sell opportunity. 

There is 2 outcomes for  Ethereum -0.06%  in the short term. They are: 

- If price goes below 597.65 and closes there, then I am expecting downside to continue to 497.40 (Where there is some localized structure which could act as support) or the lower horizontal  support zone  at 364.00. 
- Price stays above 597.65 and breaks out of the side-wards resistance. If this happens, there will be a retest on the side-wards resistance line turned support and then break to the upside. 

Please show your support and leave a like and follow - I'd really appreciate it! :-)

 ETHUSD -0.06%  update: The slow grind is a pleasant market to watch if you are managing positions over the long term. If you are trying to open a new position, it can be very hard to watch because it can turn at any point, but slowly continues higher. What is not obvious is the risk of retrace which I will talk more about in this report. 

Price is about to retest the 625 resistance (.382 of recent  bearish  swing). This level has previously proven to attract selling activity. The question is do these bears return? The higher low established at 575 indicates that price is more likely to push higher, but this is where the risk of retrace comes into play. 

The 641 reversal zone boundary is relative to the 628 high and is the area to watch for  bearish  formations IF a fake out is in order for these markets.  

Keep in mind, this is not a prediction, it is a scenario to be prepared for. If the newly established  bullish trend line  stays intact, this market may be on its way to a new high and a decisive close above the 628 level. This will change the short term outlook from  bearish  to  bullish .  

At S.C., we are not taking any new swing trade longs because price is too close to resistance levels. We would rather miss the low probability trade, even if it works out this time. We know that in the long run, the same trade would produce inconsistent results and that is not in line with our goal. 

Our plan is to wait for better prices which means a retest of 575 would have to happen. If price continues higher, then we will be evaluating for the next swing trade long opportunity.

This is almost exactly the same post as my BTCUDSD post for the day.  An indicator that I like to use to help see through the noise is the Hull  MACD , which is a difficult indicator to use because they are not a lot of resources on it.  But generally a  bearish  cross is a  bearish  cross.  I highlighted in yellow what the H-MACD looks like when you are moving through a bubble and we certainly don't see that behavior.  In other words, this  bearish  cross will tend to bring the prices down. We may see this  bearish  cross on the H-MACD cause some convergence on the normal  MACD  leading to a  bearish  cross there, which I have highlighted a previous example in blue.    

Additionally the 1h chart has some  bearish  divergence setting in.   This peak is lower than the last and we had to get the  bearish  divergence to do this.  The overall sentiment has not been enough to give this upswing any real momentum.  This isn't quite enough for me to go short but I am thinking about it.

Something different. No indicators. Just looking at price action on different time frames and looking for areas of previous activity. 

There's a lot going on here at first glance but it's not that crazy when you dive in. I started by looking at the most recent price movement. Here is the 1 hour chart for eth starting in April. We get a 5 wave structure up with the horizontal lines showing the top and the bottom of our current channel. We're looking for a corrective wave two that doesn't retrace 1 by more than 100 percent. If it does we look for a different count. 

So the current story becomes, is the 2 in? Here I have labeled a theory that says, yes, yes it is.  Doesn't mean it's true. 

Here's my thought process; the move down could be counted as a 12345 which would make it the A, then B bounces up to 550 or so, and then C corrects down below A meaning eth dips below 500 again. This would certainly still be a valid count but I started to look at areas with lots of price action recently and saw two channels. Our current channel in green and the previous channel in red. In blue are the time frames where the price shifted from one channel to the other. I suspect a third one to be coming soon. There's just so much price history in these areas that I think it's likely to return there. There are psychological and mathematical reasons for this but that discussion is for another time but I'll summarize by stating a true trope: Markets have memories. 

Is it possible that we break  bearish  out of the current channel? Most definitely. And it very well may. There are some funky waves to interpret and I'm sure different  Elliott  traders will see things differently.

I suppose, the growth is delayed. Current structure still can be an impuls only after sweeping move above 630 on high volumes. 
But. More realistic would be a continuetion of a flat like I sketched out. Because volumes on top 3 cryptocurrencies are very low, it doesn't look like before the growth. Also alts made  zig-zag  correction from the lows of 28th of May. And even more alts made impulses downwards 4-5 of June. 
Still some small growth can be in this case, but without significant changes in the essence.

ETH/USD overview. Just take a look on chart, price is so close to key level $628 from which cryptocurrency rate bounced several times. That level is a key zone for big players. You can open short near $628 with goal $400.  

If price will move down, it could go to $400. But for us that would be the greatest opportunity to buy ETH for so low price.  

I need to explain you, why I think only for short, at this moment. As you know there is no news around cryptocurrency. We have silents. It's a signal that Big players accumulate their positions. They do it in a Range moves. They wait till retail traders will get tired to wait, and sell all their positions for a low price. There could be a big moving after huge range. I see that pattern on every marker on Stock, FX and Crypto too.

In green is the last impulsive cycle imposed over where we are now to show how quickly things could go parabolic. 

My proposed wave in red may be far too conservative in both time and price movement estimations. 

Markets mirror previous actions. Cycles repeat with variation. Repetition and variation create rhythm. Habits are the rhythms of human life. Markets are reflections of humans. Charts are markers along the path.

ETH/USD overview. Just take a look on chart, price is so close to key level $628 from which cryptocurrency rate bounced several times. That level is a key zone for big players. You can open short near $628 with goal $400.  

If price will move down, it could go to $400. But for us that would be the greatest opportunity to buy ETH for so low price.  

I need to explain you, why I think only for short, at this moment. As you know there is no news around cryptocurrency. We have silents. It's a signal that Big players accumulate their positions. They do it in a Range moves. They wait till retail traders will get tired to wait, and sell all their positions for a low price. There could be a big moving after huge range.

What's up traders, I hope you're all having a good trading week so far. Let's get straight into it! 

Ethereum -0.06%  is trading right on a side-wards resistance structure at 606, and has been trading at this level since 3rd June. Price is trading upwards along a side-wards support line, which has now converged into the side-wards resistance line. Price is at a juncture, and price needs to either break upwards, and break downwards. 

Supporting the upside, there is a side-wards support line thats recently formed, if price stays above this line, it will mean price is forced to break the side-wards resistance at 612.  

If price breaks the support  trend line , then we can expect some downside. If price breaks the support  trend line , AND also hits the side-wards  resistance level , then it is a good sell opportunity. 

There is 2 outcomes for  Ethereum -0.06%  in the short term. They are: 

- If price goes below 597.65 and closes there, then I am expecting downside to continue to 497.40 (Where there is some localized structure which could act as support) or the lower horizontal  support zone  at 364.00. 
- Price stays above 597.65 and breaks out of the side-wards resistance. If this happens, there will be a retest on the side-wards resistance line turned support and then break to the upside.

 ETHUSD -0.06%  update: The slow grind is a pleasant market to watch if you are managing positions over the long term. If you are trying to open a new position, it can be very hard to watch because it can turn at any point, but slowly continues higher. What is not obvious is the risk of retrace which I will talk more about in this report. 

Price is about to retest the 625 resistance (.382 of recent  bearish  swing). This level has previously proven to attract selling activity. The question is do these bears return? The higher low established at 575 indicates that price is more likely to push higher, but this is where the risk of retrace comes into play. 

The 641 reversal zone boundary is relative to the 628 high and is the area to watch for  bearish  formations IF a fake out is in order for these markets.  

Keep in mind, this is not a prediction, it is a scenario to be prepared for. If the newly established  bullish trend line  stays intact, this market may be on its way to a new high and a decisive close above the 628 level. This will change the short term outlook from  bearish  to  bullish .

Additionally the 1h chart has some  bearish  divergence setting in.   This peak is lower than the last and we had to get the  bearish  divergence to do this.

First had a downtrending channel, recently price broke out of this channel, but finds it hard to break clearly. 
Matching up a zone of resistance and an area that looks like a double shoulder head and shoulder pattern, price is more likely to go down and test the lows for a potential bottom in the market.

Something different. No indicators. Just looking at price action on different time frames and looking for areas of previous activity. 

There's a lot going on here at first glance but it's not that crazy when you dive in. I started by looking at the most recent price movement. Here is the 1 hour chart for eth starting in April. We get a 5 wave structure up with the horizontal lines showing the top and the bottom of our current channel. We're looking for a corrective wave two that doesn't retrace 1 by more than 100 percent. If it does we look for a different count. 

So the current story becomes, is the 2 in? Here I have labeled a theory that says, yes, yes it is.  Doesn't mean it's true. 

Here's my thought process; the move down could be counted as a 12345 which would make it the A, then B bounces up to 550 or so, and then C corrects down below A meaning eth dips below 500 again. This would certainly still be a valid count but I started to look at areas with lots of price action recently and saw two channels. Our current channel in green and the previous channel in red. In blue are the time frames where the price shifted from one channel to the other. I suspect a third one to be coming soon. There's just so much price history in these areas that I think it's likely to return there. There are psychological and mathematical reasons for this but that discussion is for another time but I'll summarize by stating a true trope: Markets have memories. 

Is it possible that we break  bearish  out of the current channel? Most definitely. And it very well may. There are some funky waves to interpret and I'm sure different  Elliott  traders will see things differently. 

I'm looking from different perspectives to try to carve out the narrative.

A combined  hammer  formed on the 28th and 29th of last month (when combining the two candles, a strong  hammer  forms) ended the recent sell off for now. 

Now market is against a better  resistance zone  between 625 and 635; not only the 38,2%  Fibonacci retracement  level but also previous horizontal support from earlier this in may (see up arrows). Against this resistance, a combined  shooting star  has formed. The fact that market is keeping steady after this may imply upside is not done for now and market is just consolidating recent gains. But this has to be confirmed with a better move over 635. 

As long as dips hold toward 575 support one may expect such a move; 700 is implied after this.

So the current story becomes, is the 2 in? Here I have labeled a theory that says, yes, yes it is.  Doesn't mean it's true. 

Here's my thought process; the move down could be counted as a 12345 which would make it the A, then B bounces up to 550 or so, and then C corrects down below A meaning eth dips below 500 again. This would certainly still be a valid count but I started to look at areas with lots of price action recently and saw two channels. Our current channel in green and the previous channel in red. In blue are the time frames where the price shifted from one channel to the other. I suspect a third one to be coming soon. There's just so much price history in these areas that I think it's likely to return there. There are psychological and mathematical reasons for this but that discussion is for another time but I'll summarize by stating a true trope: Markets have memories. 

Is it possible that we break  bearish  out of the current channel? Most definitely. And it very well may. There are some funky waves to interpret and I'm sure different  Elliott  traders will see things differently.

What's up traders, I hope you're all having a good trading week so far. Let's get straight into it! 

Ethereum -0.18%  is trading right on a side-wards resistance structure at 606, and has been trading at this level since 3rd June. Price is trading upwards along a side-wards support line, which has now converged into the side-wards resistance line. Price is at a juncture, and price needs to either break upwards, and break downwards. 

Supporting the upside, there is a side-wards support line thats recently formed, if price stays above this line, it will mean price is forced to break the side-wards resistance at 612.  

If price breaks the support  trend line , then we can expect some downside. If price breaks the support  trend line , AND also hits the side-wards  resistance level , then it is a good sell opportunity. 

There is 2 outcomes for  Ethereum -0.18%  in the short term. They are: 

- If price goes below 597.65 and closes there, then I am expecting downside to continue to 497.40 (Where there is some localized structure which could act as support) or the lower horizontal  support zone  at 364.00. 
- Price stays above 597.65 and breaks out of the side-wards resistance. If this happens, there will be a retest on the side-wards resistance line turned support and then break to the upside.

 ETHUSD -0.18%  update: The slow grind is a pleasant market to watch if you are managing positions over the long term. If you are trying to open a new position, it can be very hard to watch because it can turn at any point, but slowly continues higher. What is not obvious is the risk of retrace which I will talk more about in this report. 

Price is about to retest the 625 resistance (.382 of recent  bearish  swing). This level has previously proven to attract selling activity. The question is do these bears return? The higher low established at 575 indicates that price is more likely to push higher, but this is where the risk of retrace comes into play. 

The 641 reversal zone boundary is relative to the 628 high and is the area to watch for  bearish  formations IF a fake out is in order for these markets.  

Keep in mind, this is not a prediction, it is a scenario to be prepared for. If the newly established  bullish trend line  stays intact, this market may be on its way to a new high and a decisive close above the 628 level. This will change the short term outlook from  bearish  to  bullish .

This is almost exactly the same post as my BTCUDSD post for the day.  An indicator that I like to use to help see through the noise is the Hull  MACD , which is a difficult indicator to use because they are not a lot of resources on it.  But generally a  bearish  cross is a  bearish  cross.  I highlighted in yellow what the H-MACD looks like when you are moving through a bubble and we certainly don't see that behavior.  In other words, this  bearish  cross will tend to bring the prices down. We may see this  bearish  cross on the H-MACD cause some convergence on the normal  MACD  leading to a  bearish  cross there, which I have highlighted a previous example in blue.    

Additionally the 1h chart has some  bearish  divergence setting in.   This peak is lower than the last and we had to get the  bearish  divergence to do this.  The overall sentiment has not been enough to give this upswing any real momentum.  This isn't quite enough for me to go short but I am thinking about it.  But both the micro and  daily charts  look poor enough that my optimism has turned to neutral (at the very best).

First had a downtrending channel, recently price broke out of this channel, but finds it hard to break clearly. 
Matching up a zone of resistance and an area that looks like a double shoulder head and shoulder pattern, price is more likely to go down and test the lows for a potential bottom in the market. 

Conclusion: View is neutral until it either breaks the 630 or 490 barrier. Shorter term views, a more negative outlook, maybe price will retest at 630 and then drop off.

Something different. No indicators. Just looking at price action on different time frames and looking for areas of previous activity. 

There's a lot going on here at first glance but it's not that crazy when you dive in. I started by looking at the most recent price movement. Here is the 1 hour chart for eth starting in April. We get a 5 wave structure up with the horizontal lines showing the top and the bottom of our current channel. We're looking for a corrective wave two that doesn't retrace 1 by more than 100 percent. If it does we look for a different count. 

So the current story becomes, is the 2 in? Here I have labeled a theory that says, yes, yes it is.  Doesn't mean it's true. 

Here's my thought process; the move down could be counted as a 12345 which would make it the A, then B bounces up to 550 or so, and then C corrects down below A meaning eth dips below 500 again. This would certainly still be a valid count but I started to look at areas with lots of price action recently and saw two channels. Our current channel in green and the previous channel in red. In blue are the time frames where the price shifted from one channel to the other. I suspect a third one to be coming soon. There's just so much price history in these areas that I think it's likely to return there. There are psychological and mathematical reasons for this but that discussion is for another time but I'll summarize by stating a true trope: Markets have memories. 

Is it possible that we break  bearish  out of the current channel? Most definitely. And it very well may. There are some funky waves to interpret and I'm sure different  Elliott  traders will see things differently.

This is almost exactly the same post as my BTCUDSD post for the day.  An indicator that I like to use to help see through the noise is the Hull  MACD , which is a difficult indicator to use because they are not a lot of resources on it.  But generally a  bearish  cross is a  bearish  cross.  I highlighted in yellow what the H-MACD looks like when you are moving through a bubble and we certainly don't see that behavior.  In other words, this  bearish  cross will tend to bring the prices down. We may see this  bearish  cross on the H-MACD cause some convergence on the normal  MACD  leading to a  bearish  cross there, which I have highlighted a previous example in blue.    

Additionally the 1h chart has some  bearish  divergence setting in.   This peak is lower than the last and we had to get the  bearish  divergence to do this.  The overall sentiment has not been enough to give this upswing any real momentum.  This isn't quite enough for me to go short but I am thinking about it.  But both the micro and  daily charts  look poor enough that my optimism has turned to neutral (at the very best).

First had a downtrending channel, recently price broke out of this channel, but finds it hard to break clearly. 
Matching up a zone of resistance and an area that looks like a double shoulder head and shoulder pattern, price is more likely to go down and test the lows for a potential bottom in the market. 

Conclusion: View is neutral until it either breaks the 630 or 490 barrier. Shorter term views, a more negative outlook, maybe price will retest at 630 and then drop off.

Something different. No indicators. Just looking at price action on different time frames and looking for areas of previous activity. 

There's a lot going on here at first glance but it's not that crazy when you dive in. I started by looking at the most recent price movement. Here is the 1 hour chart for eth starting in April. We get a 5 wave structure up with the horizontal lines showing the top and the bottom of our current channel. We're looking for a corrective wave two that doesn't retrace 1 by more than 100 percent. If it does we look for a different count. 

So the current story becomes, is the 2 in? Here I have labeled a theory that says, yes, yes it is.  Doesn't mean it's true. 

Here's my thought process; the move down could be counted as a 12345 which would make it the A, then B bounces up to 550 or so, and then C corrects down below A meaning eth dips below 500 again. This would certainly still be a valid count but I started to look at areas with lots of price action recently and saw two channels. Our current channel in green and the previous channel in red. In blue are the time frames where the price shifted from one channel to the other. I suspect a third one to be coming soon. There's just so much price history in these areas that I think it's likely to return there. There are psychological and mathematical reasons for this but that discussion is for another time but I'll summarize by stating a true trope: Markets have memories. 

Is it possible that we break  bearish  out of the current channel? Most definitely. And it very well may. There are some funky waves to interpret and I'm sure different  Elliott  traders will see things differently. 

I'm looking from different perspectives to try to carve out the narrative.

What's up traders, I hope you're all having a good trading week so far. Let's get straight into it! 

Ethereum -0.13%  is trading right on a side-wards resistance structure at 606, and has been trading at this level since 3rd June. Price is trading upwards along a side-wards support line, which has now converged into the side-wards resistance line. Price is at a juncture, and price needs to either break upwards, and break downwards. 

Supporting the upside, there is a side-wards support line thats recently formed, if price stays above this line, it will mean price is forced to break the side-wards resistance at 612.  

If price breaks the support  trend line , then we can expect some downside. If price breaks the support  trend line , AND also hits the side-wards  resistance level , then it is a good sell opportunity. 

There is 2 outcomes for  Ethereum -0.13%  in the short term. They are: 

- If price goes below 597.65 and closes there, then I am expecting downside to continue to 497.40 (Where there is some localized structure which could act as support) or the lower horizontal  support zone  at 364.00. 
- Price stays above 597.65 and breaks out of the side-wards resistance. If this happens, there will be a retest on the side-wards resistance line turned support and then break to the upside.

 ETHUSD -0.13%  update: The slow grind is a pleasant market to watch if you are managing positions over the long term. If you are trying to open a new position, it can be very hard to watch because it can turn at any point, but slowly continues higher. What is not obvious is the risk of retrace which I will talk more about in this report. 

Price is about to retest the 625 resistance (.382 of recent  bearish  swing). This level has previously proven to attract selling activity. The question is do these bears return? The higher low established at 575 indicates that price is more likely to push higher, but this is where the risk of retrace comes into play. 

The 641 reversal zone boundary is relative to the 628 high and is the area to watch for  bearish  formations IF a fake out is in order for these markets.  

Keep in mind, this is not a prediction, it is a scenario to be prepared for. If the newly established  bullish trend line  stays intact, this market may be on its way to a new high and a decisive close above the 628 level. This will change the short term outlook from  bearish  to  bullish .  

At S.C., we are not taking any new swing trade longs because price is too close to resistance levels. We would rather miss the low probability trade, even if it works out this time. We know that in the long run, the same trade would produce inconsistent results and that is not in line with our goal. 

Our plan is to wait for better prices which means a retest of 575 would have to happen. If price continues higher, then we will be evaluating for the next swing trade long opportunity.

The 641 reversal zone boundary is relative to the 628 high and is the area to watch for  bearish  formations IF a fake out is in order for these markets.  

Keep in mind, this is not a prediction, it is a scenario to be prepared for. If the newly established  bullish trend line  stays intact, this market may be on its way to a new high and a decisive close above the 628 level. This will change the short term outlook from  bearish  to  bullish .  

At S.C., we are not taking any new swing trade longs because price is too close to resistance levels. We would rather miss the low probability trade, even if it works out this time. We know that in the long run, the same trade would produce inconsistent results and that is not in line with our goal. 

Our plan is to wait for better prices which means a retest of 575 would have to happen. If price continues higher, then we will be evaluating for the next swing trade long opportunity.

This is almost exactly the same post as my BTCUDSD post for the day.  An indicator that I like to use to help see through the noise is the Hull  MACD , which is a difficult indicator to use because they are not a lot of resources on it.  But generally a  bearish  cross is a  bearish  cross.  I highlighted in yellow what the H-MACD looks like when you are moving through a bubble and we certainly don't see that behavior.  In other words, this  bearish  cross will tend to bring the prices down. We may see this  bearish  cross on the H-MACD cause some convergence on the normal  MACD  leading to a  bearish  cross there, which I have highlighted a previous example in blue.    

Additionally the 1h chart has some  bearish  divergence setting in.   This peak is lower than the last and we had to get the  bearish  divergence to do this.  The overall sentiment has not been enough to give this upswing any real momentum.  This isn't quite enough for me to go short but I am thinking about it.  But both the micro and  daily charts  look poor enough that my optimism has turned to neutral (at the very best).

First had a downtrending channel, recently price broke out of this channel, but finds it hard to break clearly. 
Matching up a zone of resistance and an area that looks like a double shoulder head and shoulder pattern, price is more likely to go down and test the lows for a potential bottom in the market.

Something different. No indicators. Just looking at price action on different time frames and looking for areas of previous activity. 

There's a lot going on here at first glance but it's not that crazy when you dive in. I started by looking at the most recent price movement. Here is the 1 hour chart for eth starting in April. We get a 5 wave structure up with the horizontal lines showing the top and the bottom of our current channel. We're looking for a corrective wave two that doesn't retrace 1 by more than 100 percent. If it does we look for a different count. 

So the current story becomes, is the 2 in? Here I have labeled a theory that says, yes, yes it is.  Doesn't mean it's true. 

Here's my thought process; the move down could be counted as a 12345 which would make it the A, then B bounces up to 550 or so, and then C corrects down below A meaning eth dips below 500 again. This would certainly still be a valid count but I started to look at areas with lots of price action recently and saw two channels. Our current channel in green and the previous channel in red. In blue are the time frames where the price shifted from one channel to the other. I suspect a third one to be coming soon. There's just so much price history in these areas that I think it's likely to return there. There are psychological and mathematical reasons for this but that discussion is for another time but I'll summarize by stating a true trope: Markets have memories. 

Is it possible that we break  bearish  out of the current channel? Most definitely. And it very well may. There are some funky waves to interpret and I'm sure different  Elliott  traders will see things differently.

What's up traders, I hope you're all having a good trading week so far. Let's get straight into it! 

Ethereum -0.16%  is trading right on a side-wards resistance structure at 606, and has been trading at this level since 3rd June. Price is trading upwards along a side-wards support line, which has now converged into the side-wards resistance line. Price is at a juncture, and price needs to either break upwards, and break downwards. 

Supporting the upside, there is a side-wards support line thats recently formed, if price stays above this line, it will mean price is forced to break the side-wards resistance at 612.  

If price breaks the support  trend line , then we can expect some downside. If price breaks the support  trend line , AND also hits the side-wards  resistance level , then it is a good sell opportunity. 

There is 2 outcomes for  Ethereum -0.16%  in the short term. They are: 

- If price goes below 597.65 and closes there, then I am expecting downside to continue to 497.40 (Where there is some localized structure which could act as support) or the lower horizontal  support zone  at 364.00. 
- Price stays above 597.65 and breaks out of the side-wards resistance. If this happens, there will be a retest on the side-wards resistance line turned support and then break to the upside. 

Please show your support and leave a like and follow - I'd really appreciate it! :-)

If you are trying to open a new position, it can be very hard to watch because it can turn at any point, but slowly continues higher. What is not obvious is the risk of retrace which I will talk more about in this report.

The higher low established at 575 indicates that price is more likely to push higher, but this is where the risk of retrace comes into play.

1.	Red scenario ( bearish ). ETH/USD will move towards the closest  support area  at $596.08 and break through it targeting the next  support area  at $566.90. 
2.	Orange scenario (neutral).  Ethereum -0.16%  will stay within the current range, limited by the  support area  at $596.08 and the closest  resistance area  at $626.66 without significant price changes. 
3.	Green scenario ( bullish ). The currency pair will break through $626.66 targeting the next  resistance area  at $662.39, which coincides with the 1 retracement level.

What's up traders, I hope you're all having a good trading week so far. Let's get straight into it! 

Ethereum -0.16%  is trading right on a side-wards resistance structure at 606, and has been trading at this level since 3rd June. Price is trading upwards along a side-wards support line, which has now converged into the side-wards resistance line. Price is at a juncture, and price needs to either break upwards, and break downwards. 

Supporting the upside, there is a side-wards support line thats recently formed, if price stays above this line, it will mean price is forced to break the side-wards resistance at 612.  

If price breaks the support  trend line , then we can expect some downside. If price breaks the support  trend line , AND also hits the side-wards  resistance level , then it is a good sell opportunity. 

There is 2 outcomes for  Ethereum -0.16%  in the short term. They are: 

- If price goes below 597.65 and closes there, then I am expecting downside to continue to 497.40 (Where there is some localized structure which could act as support) or the lower horizontal  support zone  at 364.00. 
- Price stays above 597.65 and breaks out of the side-wards resistance. If this happens, there will be a retest on the side-wards resistance line turned support and then break to the upside. 

Please show your support and leave a like and follow - I'd really appreciate it! :-)

 ETHUSD -0.16%  update: The slow grind is a pleasant market to watch if you are managing positions over the long term. If you are trying to open a new position, it can be very hard to watch because it can turn at any point, but slowly continues higher. What is not obvious is the risk of retrace which I will talk more about in this report. 

Price is about to retest the 625 resistance (.382 of recent  bearish  swing). This level has previously proven to attract selling activity. The question is do these bears return? The higher low established at 575 indicates that price is more likely to push higher, but this is where the risk of retrace comes into play. 

The 641 reversal zone boundary is relative to the 628 high and is the area to watch for  bearish  formations IF a fake out is in order for these markets.  

Keep in mind, this is not a prediction, it is a scenario to be prepared for. If the newly established  bullish trend line  stays intact, this market may be on its way to a new high and a decisive close above the 628 level. This will change the short term outlook from  bearish  to  bullish .  

At S.C., we are not taking any new swing trade longs because price is too close to resistance levels. We would rather miss the low probability trade, even if it works out this time. We know that in the long run, the same trade would produce inconsistent results and that is not in line with our goal. 

Our plan is to wait for better prices which means a retest of 575 would have to happen. If price continues higher, then we will be evaluating for the next swing trade long opportunity.

This is almost exactly the same post as my BTCUDSD post for the day.  An indicator that I like to use to help see through the noise is the Hull  MACD , which is a difficult indicator to use because they are not a lot of resources on it.  But generally a  bearish  cross is a  bearish  cross.  I highlighted in yellow what the H-MACD looks like when you are moving through a bubble and we certainly don't see that behavior.  In other words, this  bearish  cross will tend to bring the prices down. We may see this  bearish  cross on the H-MACD cause some convergence on the normal  MACD  leading to a  bearish  cross there, which I have highlighted a previous example in blue.    

Additionally the 1h chart has some  bearish  divergence setting in.   This peak is lower than the last and we had to get the  bearish  divergence to do this.  The overall sentiment has not been enough to give this upswing any real momentum.  This isn't quite enough for me to go short but I am thinking about it.

Something different. No indicators. Just looking at price action on different time frames and looking for areas of previous activity. 

There's a lot going on here at first glance but it's not that crazy when you dive in. I started by looking at the most recent price movement. Here is the 1 hour chart for eth starting in April. We get a 5 wave structure up with the horizontal lines showing the top and the bottom of our current channel. We're looking for a corrective wave two that doesn't retrace 1 by more than 100 percent. If it does we look for a different count. 

So the current story becomes, is the 2 in? Here I have labeled a theory that says, yes, yes it is.  Doesn't mean it's true. 

Here's my thought process; the move down could be counted as a 12345 which would make it the A, then B bounces up to 550 or so, and then C corrects down below A meaning eth dips below 500 again. This would certainly still be a valid count but I started to look at areas with lots of price action recently and saw two channels. Our current channel in green and the previous channel in red. In blue are the time frames where the price shifted from one channel to the other. I suspect a third one to be coming soon. There's just so much price history in these areas that I think it's likely to return there. There are psychological and mathematical reasons for this but that discussion is for another time but I'll summarize by stating a true trope: Markets have memories. 

Is it possible that we break  bearish  out of the current channel? Most definitely. And it very well may. There are some funky waves to interpret and I'm sure different  Elliott  traders will see things differently.

What's up traders, I hope you're all having a good trading week so far. Let's get straight into it! 

Ethereum -0.16%  is trading right on a side-wards resistance structure at 606, and has been trading at this level since 3rd June. Price is trading upwards along a side-wards support line, which has now converged into the side-wards resistance line. Price is at a juncture, and price needs to either break upwards, and break downwards. 

Supporting the upside, there is a side-wards support line thats recently formed, if price stays above this line, it will mean price is forced to break the side-wards resistance at 612.  

If price breaks the support  trend line , then we can expect some downside. If price breaks the support  trend line , AND also hits the side-wards  resistance level , then it is a good sell opportunity. 

There is 2 outcomes for  Ethereum -0.16%  in the short term. They are: 

- If price goes below 597.65 and closes there, then I am expecting downside to continue to 497.40 (Where there is some localized structure which could act as support) or the lower horizontal  support zone  at 364.00. 
- Price stays above 597.65 and breaks out of the side-wards resistance. If this happens, there will be a retest on the side-wards resistance line turned support and then break to the upside.

 ETHUSD -0.16%  update: The slow grind is a pleasant market to watch if you are managing positions over the long term. If you are trying to open a new position, it can be very hard to watch because it can turn at any point, but slowly continues higher. What is not obvious is the risk of retrace which I will talk more about in this report. 

Price is about to retest the 625 resistance (.382 of recent  bearish  swing). This level has previously proven to attract selling activity. The question is do these bears return? The higher low established at 575 indicates that price is more likely to push higher, but this is where the risk of retrace comes into play. 

The 641 reversal zone boundary is relative to the 628 high and is the area to watch for  bearish  formations IF a fake out is in order for these markets.  

Keep in mind, this is not a prediction, it is a scenario to be prepared for. If the newly established  bullish trend line  stays intact, this market may be on its way to a new high and a decisive close above the 628 level. This will change the short term outlook from  bearish  to  bullish .  

At S.C., we are not taking any new swing trade longs because price is too close to resistance levels. We would rather miss the low probability trade, even if it works out this time. We know that in the long run, the same trade would produce inconsistent results and that is not in line with our goal. 

Our plan is to wait for better prices which means a retest of 575 would have to happen. If price continues higher, then we will be evaluating for the next swing trade long opportunity.

Something different. No indicators. Just looking at price action on different time frames and looking for areas of previous activity. 

There's a lot going on here at first glance but it's not that crazy when you dive in. I started by looking at the most recent price movement. Here is the 1 hour chart for eth starting in April. We get a 5 wave structure up with the horizontal lines showing the top and the bottom of our current channel. We're looking for a corrective wave two that doesn't retrace 1 by more than 100 percent. If it does we look for a different count. 

So the current story becomes, is the 2 in? Here I have labeled a theory that says, yes, yes it is.  Doesn't mean it's true. 

Here's my thought process; the move down could be counted as a 12345 which would make it the A, then B bounces up to 550 or so, and then C corrects down below A meaning eth dips below 500 again. This would certainly still be a valid count but I started to look at areas with lots of price action recently and saw two channels. Our current channel in green and the previous channel in red. In blue are the time frames where the price shifted from one channel to the other. I suspect a third one to be coming soon. There's just so much price history in these areas that I think it's likely to return there. There are psychological and mathematical reasons for this but that discussion is for another time but I'll summarize by stating a true trope: Markets have memories. 

Is it possible that we break  bearish  out of the current channel? Most definitely. And it very well may. There are some funky waves to interpret and I'm sure different  Elliott  traders will see things differently. 

I'm looking from different perspectives to try to carve out the narrative.

A combined  hammer  formed on the 28th and 29th of last month (when combining the two candles, a strong  hammer  forms) ended the recent sell off for now. 

Now market is against a better  resistance zone  between 625 and 635; not only the 38,2%  Fibonacci retracement  level but also previous horizontal support from earlier this in may (see up arrows). Against this resistance, a combined  shooting star  has formed. The fact that market is keeping steady after this may imply upside is not done for now and market is just consolidating recent gains. But this has to be confirmed with a better move over 635. 

As long as dips hold toward 575 support one may expect such a move; 700 is implied after this.

I suppose, the growth is delayed. Current structure still can be an impuls only after sweeping move above 630 on high volumes. 
But. More realistic would be a continuetion of a flat like I sketched out. Because volumes on top 3 cryptocurrencies are very low, it doesn't look like before the growth. Also alts made  zig-zag  correction from the lows of 28th of May. And even more alts made impulses downwards 4-5 of June. 
Still some small growth can be in this case, but without significant changes in the essence.

ETH/USD overview. Just take a look on chart, price is so close to key level $628 from which cryptocurrency rate bounced several times. That level is a key zone for big players. You can open short near $628 with goal $400.  

If price will move down, it could go to $400. But for us that would be the greatest opportunity to buy ETH for so low price.  

I need to explain you, why I think only for short, at this moment. As you know there is no news around cryptocurrency. We have silents. It's a signal that Big players accumulate their positions. They do it in a Range moves. They wait till retail traders will get tired to wait, and sell all their positions for a low price. There could be a big moving after huge range. I see that pattern on every marker on Stock, FX and Crypto too.

ETH/USD overview. Just take a look on chart, price is so close to key level $628 from which cryptocurrency rate bounced several times. That level is a key zone for big players. You can open short near $628 with goal $400.  

If price will move down, it could go to $400. But for us that would be the greatest opportunity to buy ETH for so low price.  

I need to explain you, why I think only for short, at this moment. As you know there is no news around cryptocurrency. We have silents. It's a signal that Big players accumulate their positions. They do it in a Range moves. They wait till retail traders will get tired to wait, and sell all their positions for a low price. There could be a big moving after huge range.

What's up traders, I hope you're all having a good trading week so far. Let's get straight into it! 

Ethereum -0.13%  is trading right on a side-wards resistance structure at 606, and has been trading at this level since 3rd June. Price is trading upwards along a side-wards support line, which has now converged into the side-wards resistance line. Price is at a juncture, and price needs to either break upwards, and break downwards. 

Supporting the upside, there is a side-wards support line thats recently formed, if price stays above this line, it will mean price is forced to break the side-wards resistance at 612.  

If price breaks the support  trend line , then we can expect some downside. If price breaks the support  trend line , AND also hits the side-wards  resistance level , then it is a good sell opportunity. 

There is 2 outcomes for  Ethereum -0.13%  in the short term. They are: 

- If price goes below 597.65 and closes there, then I am expecting downside to continue to 497.40 (Where there is some localized structure which could act as support) or the lower horizontal  support zone  at 364.00. 
- Price stays above 597.65 and breaks out of the side-wards resistance. If this happens, there will be a retest on the side-wards resistance line turned support and then break to the upside.

 ETHUSD              update: The slow grind is a pleasant market to watch if you are managing positions over the long term. If you are trying to open a new position, it can be very hard to watch because it can turn at any point, but slowly continues higher. What is not obvious is the risk of retrace which I will talk more about in this report. 

Price is about to retest the 625 resistance (.382 of recent  bearish  swing). This level has previously proven to attract selling activity. The question is do these bears return? The higher low established at 575 indicates that price is more likely to push higher, but this is where the risk of retrace comes into play. 

The 641 reversal zone boundary is relative to the 628 high and is the area to watch for  bearish  formations IF a fake out is in order for these markets.  

Keep in mind, this is not a prediction, it is a scenario to be prepared for. If the newly established  bullish trend line  stays intact, this market may be on its way to a new high and a decisive close above the 628 level. This will change the short term outlook from  bearish  to  bullish .

Additionally the 1h chart has some  bearish  divergence setting in.   This peak is lower than the last and we had to get the  bearish  divergence to do this.

First had a downtrending channel, recently price broke out of this channel, but finds it hard to break clearly. 
Matching up a zone of resistance and an area that looks like a double shoulder head and shoulder pattern, price is more likely to go down and test the lows for a potential bottom in the market. 

Conclusion: View is neutral until it either breaks the 630 or 490 barrier. Shorter term views, a more negative outlook, maybe price will retest at 630 and then drop off.

Something different. No indicators. Just looking at price action on different time frames and looking for areas of previous activity. 

There's a lot going on here at first glance but it's not that crazy when you dive in. I started by looking at the most recent price movement. Here is the 1 hour chart for eth starting in April. We get a 5 wave structure up with the horizontal lines showing the top and the bottom of our current channel. We're looking for a corrective wave two that doesn't retrace 1 by more than 100 percent. If it does we look for a different count. 

So the current story becomes, is the 2 in? Here I have labeled a theory that says, yes, yes it is.  Doesn't mean it's true. 

Here's my thought process; the move down could be counted as a 12345 which would make it the A, then B bounces up to 550 or so, and then C corrects down below A meaning eth dips below 500 again. This would certainly still be a valid count but I started to look at areas with lots of price action recently and saw two channels. Our current channel in green and the previous channel in red. In blue are the time frames where the price shifted from one channel to the other. I suspect a third one to be coming soon. There's just so much price history in these areas that I think it's likely to return there. There are psychological and mathematical reasons for this but that discussion is for another time but I'll summarize by stating a true trope: Markets have memories. 

Is it possible that we break  bearish  out of the current channel? Most definitely. And it very well may. There are some funky waves to interpret and I'm sure different  Elliott  traders will see things differently. 

I'm looking from different perspectives to try to carve out the narrative.

First had a downtrending channel, recently price broke out of this channel, but finds it hard to break clearly. 
Matching up a zone of resistance and an area that looks like a double shoulder head and shoulder pattern, price is more likely to go down and test the lows for a potential bottom in the market.

Something different. No indicators. Just looking at price action on different time frames and looking for areas of previous activity. 

There's a lot going on here at first glance but it's not that crazy when you dive in. I started by looking at the most recent price movement. Here is the 1 hour chart for eth starting in April. We get a 5 wave structure up with the horizontal lines showing the top and the bottom of our current channel. We're looking for a corrective wave two that doesn't retrace 1 by more than 100 percent. If it does we look for a different count. 

So the current story becomes, is the 2 in? Here I have labeled a theory that says, yes, yes it is.  Doesn't mean it's true. 

Here's my thought process; the move down could be counted as a 12345 which would make it the A, then B bounces up to 550 or so, and then C corrects down below A meaning eth dips below 500 again. This would certainly still be a valid count but I started to look at areas with lots of price action recently and saw two channels. Our current channel in green and the previous channel in red. In blue are the time frames where the price shifted from one channel to the other. I suspect a third one to be coming soon. There's just so much price history in these areas that I think it's likely to return there. There are psychological and mathematical reasons for this but that discussion is for another time but I'll summarize by stating a true trope: Markets have memories. 

Is it possible that we break  bearish  out of the current channel? Most definitely. And it very well may. There are some funky waves to interpret and I'm sure different  Elliott  traders will see things differently. 

I'm looking from different perspectives to try to carve out the narrative.

What's up traders, I hope you're all having a good trading week so far. Let's get straight into it! 

Ethereum -0.07%  is trading right on a side-wards resistance structure at 606, and has been trading at this level since 3rd June. Price is trading upwards along a side-wards support line, which has now converged into the side-wards resistance line. Price is at a juncture, and price needs to either break upwards, and break downwards. 

Supporting the upside, there is a side-wards support line thats recently formed, if price stays above this line, it will mean price is forced to break the side-wards resistance at 612.  

If price breaks the support  trend line , then we can expect some downside. If price breaks the support  trend line , AND also hits the side-wards  resistance level , then it is a good sell opportunity. 

There is 2 outcomes for  Ethereum -0.07%  in the short term. They are: 

- If price goes below 597.65 and closes there, then I am expecting downside to continue to 497.40 (Where there is some localized structure which could act as support) or the lower horizontal  support zone  at 364.00. 
- Price stays above 597.65 and breaks out of the side-wards resistance. If this happens, there will be a retest on the side-wards resistance line turned support and then break to the upside.

 ETHUSD -0.07%  update: The slow grind is a pleasant market to watch if you are managing positions over the long term. If you are trying to open a new position, it can be very hard to watch because it can turn at any point, but slowly continues higher. What is not obvious is the risk of retrace which I will talk more about in this report. 

Price is about to retest the 625 resistance (.382 of recent  bearish  swing). This level has previously proven to attract selling activity. The question is do these bears return? The higher low established at 575 indicates that price is more likely to push higher, but this is where the risk of retrace comes into play. 

The 641 reversal zone boundary is relative to the 628 high and is the area to watch for  bearish  formations IF a fake out is in order for these markets.  

Keep in mind, this is not a prediction, it is a scenario to be prepared for. If the newly established  bullish trend line  stays intact, this market may be on its way to a new high and a decisive close above the 628 level. This will change the short term outlook from  bearish  to  bullish .

This is almost exactly the same post as my BTCUDSD post for the day.  An indicator that I like to use to help see through the noise is the Hull  MACD , which is a difficult indicator to use because they are not a lot of resources on it.  But generally a  bearish  cross is a  bearish  cross.  I highlighted in yellow what the H-MACD looks like when you are moving through a bubble and we certainly don't see that behavior.  In other words, this  bearish  cross will tend to bring the prices down. We may see this  bearish  cross on the H-MACD cause some convergence on the normal  MACD  leading to a  bearish  cross there, which I have highlighted a previous example in blue.    

Additionally the 1h chart has some  bearish  divergence setting in.   This peak is lower than the last and we had to get the  bearish  divergence to do this.  The overall sentiment has not been enough to give this upswing any real momentum.  This isn't quite enough for me to go short but I am thinking about it.

This is almost exactly the same post as my BTCUDSD post for the day.  An indicator that I like to use to help see through the noise is the Hull  MACD , which is a difficult indicator to use because they are not a lot of resources on it.  But generally a  bearish  cross is a  bearish  cross.  I highlighted in yellow what the H-MACD looks like when you are moving through a bubble and we certainly don't see that behavior.  In other words, this  bearish  cross will tend to bring the prices down. We may see this  bearish  cross on the H-MACD cause some convergence on the normal  MACD  leading to a  bearish  cross there, which I have highlighted a previous example in blue.    

Additionally the 1h chart has some  bearish  divergence setting in.   This peak is lower than the last and we had to get the  bearish  divergence to do this.  The overall sentiment has not been enough to give this upswing any real momentum.  This isn't quite enough for me to go short but I am thinking about it.  But both the micro and  daily charts  look poor enough that my optimism has turned to neutral (at the very best).

First had a downtrending channel, recently price broke out of this channel, but finds it hard to break clearly. 
Matching up a zone of resistance and an area that looks like a double shoulder head and shoulder pattern, price is more likely to go down and test the lows for a potential bottom in the market.

Something different. No indicators. Just looking at price action on different time frames and looking for areas of previous activity. 

There's a lot going on here at first glance but it's not that crazy when you dive in. I started by looking at the most recent price movement. Here is the 1 hour chart for eth starting in April. We get a 5 wave structure up with the horizontal lines showing the top and the bottom of our current channel. We're looking for a corrective wave two that doesn't retrace 1 by more than 100 percent. If it does we look for a different count. 

So the current story becomes, is the 2 in? Here I have labeled a theory that says, yes, yes it is.  Doesn't mean it's true. 

Here's my thought process; the move down could be counted as a 12345 which would make it the A, then B bounces up to 550 or so, and then C corrects down below A meaning eth dips below 500 again. This would certainly still be a valid count but I started to look at areas with lots of price action recently and saw two channels. Our current channel in green and the previous channel in red. In blue are the time frames where the price shifted from one channel to the other. I suspect a third one to be coming soon. There's just so much price history in these areas that I think it's likely to return there. There are psychological and mathematical reasons for this but that discussion is for another time but I'll summarize by stating a true trope: Markets have memories. 

Is it possible that we break  bearish  out of the current channel? Most definitely. And it very well may. There are some funky waves to interpret and I'm sure different  Elliott  traders will see things differently. 

I'm looking from different perspectives to try to carve out the narrative.

What's up traders, I hope you're all having a good trading week so far. Let's get straight into it! 

Ethereum -0.05%  is trading right on a side-wards resistance structure at 606, and has been trading at this level since 3rd June. Price is trading upwards along a side-wards support line, which has now converged into the side-wards resistance line. Price is at a juncture, and price needs to either break upwards, and break downwards. 

Supporting the upside, there is a side-wards support line thats recently formed, if price stays above this line, it will mean price is forced to break the side-wards resistance at 612.  

If price breaks the support  trend line , then we can expect some downside. If price breaks the support  trend line , AND also hits the side-wards  resistance level , then it is a good sell opportunity. 

There is 2 outcomes for  Ethereum -0.05%  in the short term. They are: 

- If price goes below 597.65 and closes there, then I am expecting downside to continue to 497.40 (Where there is some localized structure which could act as support) or the lower horizontal  support zone  at 364.00. 
- Price stays above 597.65 and breaks out of the side-wards resistance. If this happens, there will be a retest on the side-wards resistance line turned support and then break to the upside. 

Please show your support and leave a like and follow - I'd really appreciate it! :-)

343,1528343739.0,MarcPMarkets,ETHUSD: Poised To Break Higher But 641 Points To Vulnerability.,"
 ETHUSD -0.05%  update: The slow grind is a pleasant market to watch if you are managing positions over the long term. If you are trying to open a new position, it can be very hard to watch because it can turn at any point, but slowly continues higher. What is not obvious is the risk of retrace which I will talk more about in this report. 

Price is about to retest the 625 resistance (.382 of recent  bearish  swing). This level has previously proven to attract selling activity. The question is do these bears return? The higher low established at 575 indicates that price is more likely to push higher, but this is where the risk of retrace comes into play. 

The 641 reversal zone boundary is relative to the 628 high and is the area to watch for  bearish  formations IF a fake out is in order for these markets.  

Keep in mind, this is not a prediction, it is a scenario to be prepared for. If the newly established  bullish trend line  stays intact, this market may be on its way to a new high and a decisive close above the 628 level. This will change the short term outlook from  bearish  to  bullish .  

At S.C., we are not taking any new swing trade longs because price is too close to resistance levels. We would rather miss the low probability trade, even if it works out this time. We know that in the long run, the same trade would produce inconsistent results and that is not in line with our goal. 

Our plan is to wait for better prices which means a retest of 575 would have to happen. If price continues higher, then we will be evaluating for the next swing trade long opportunity.

 ETHUSD -0.05%  update: The slow grind is a pleasant market to watch if you are managing positions over the long term. If you are trying to open a new position, it can be very hard to watch because it can turn at any point, but slowly continues higher. What is not obvious is the risk of retrace which I will talk more about in this report. 

Price is about to retest the 625 resistance (.382 of recent  bearish  swing). This level has previously proven to attract selling activity. The question is do these bears return? The higher low established at 575 indicates that price is more likely to push higher, but this is where the risk of retrace comes into play. 

The 641 reversal zone boundary is relative to the 628 high and is the area to watch for  bearish  formations IF a fake out is in order for these markets.  

Keep in mind, this is not a prediction, it is a scenario to be prepared for. If the newly established  bullish trend line  stays intact, this market may be on its way to a new high and a decisive close above the 628 level. This will change the short term outlook from  bearish  to  bullish .  

At S.C., we are not taking any new swing trade longs because price is too close to resistance levels. We would rather miss the low probability trade, even if it works out this time. We know that in the long run, the same trade would produce inconsistent results and that is not in line with our goal. 

Our plan is to wait for better prices which means a retest of 575 would have to happen. If price continues higher, then we will be evaluating for the next swing trade long opportunity.

This is almost exactly the same post as my BTCUDSD post for the day.  An indicator that I like to use to help see through the noise is the Hull  MACD , which is a difficult indicator to use because they are not a lot of resources on it.  But generally a  bearish  cross is a  bearish  cross.  I highlighted in yellow what the H-MACD looks like when you are moving through a bubble and we certainly don't see that behavior.  In other words, this  bearish  cross will tend to bring the prices down. We may see this  bearish  cross on the H-MACD cause some convergence on the normal  MACD  leading to a  bearish  cross there, which I have highlighted a previous example in blue.    

Additionally the 1h chart has some  bearish  divergence setting in.   This peak is lower than the last and we had to get the  bearish  divergence to do this.  The overall sentiment has not been enough to give this upswing any real momentum.  This isn't quite enough for me to go short but I am thinking about it.

Something different. No indicators. Just looking at price action on different time frames and looking for areas of previous activity. 

There's a lot going on here at first glance but it's not that crazy when you dive in. I started by looking at the most recent price movement. Here is the 1 hour chart for eth starting in April. We get a 5 wave structure up with the horizontal lines showing the top and the bottom of our current channel. We're looking for a corrective wave two that doesn't retrace 1 by more than 100 percent. If it does we look for a different count. 

So the current story becomes, is the 2 in? Here I have labeled a theory that says, yes, yes it is.  Doesn't mean it's true. 

Here's my thought process; the move down could be counted as a 12345 which would make it the A, then B bounces up to 550 or so, and then C corrects down below A meaning eth dips below 500 again. This would certainly still be a valid count but I started to look at areas with lots of price action recently and saw two channels. Our current channel in green and the previous channel in red. In blue are the time frames where the price shifted from one channel to the other. I suspect a third one to be coming soon. There's just so much price history in these areas that I think it's likely to return there. There are psychological and mathematical reasons for this but that discussion is for another time but I'll summarize by stating a true trope: Markets have memories. 

Is it possible that we break  bearish  out of the current channel? Most definitely. And it very well may. There are some funky waves to interpret and I'm sure different  Elliott  traders will see things differently.

1.	Red scenario ( bearish ). ETH/USD will move towards the closest  support area  at $596.08 and break through it targeting the next  support area  at $566.90. 
2.	Orange scenario (neutral).  Ethereum -0.05%  will stay within the current range, limited by the  support area  at $596.08 and the closest  resistance area  at $626.66 without significant price changes. 
3.	Green scenario ( bullish ). The currency pair will break through $626.66 targeting the next  resistance area  at $662.39, which coincides with the 1 retracement level.

What's up traders, I hope you're all having a good trading week so far. Let's get straight into it! 

Ethereum -0.05%  is trading right on a side-wards resistance structure at 606, and has been trading at this level since 3rd June. Price is trading upwards along a side-wards support line, which has now converged into the side-wards resistance line. Price is at a juncture, and price needs to either break upwards, and break downwards. 

Supporting the upside, there is a side-wards support line thats recently formed, if price stays above this line, it will mean price is forced to break the side-wards resistance at 612.  

If price breaks the support  trend line , then we can expect some downside. If price breaks the support  trend line , AND also hits the side-wards  resistance level , then it is a good sell opportunity. 

There is 2 outcomes for  Ethereum -0.05%  in the short term. They are: 

- If price goes below 597.65 and closes there, then I am expecting downside to continue to 497.40 (Where there is some localized structure which could act as support) or the lower horizontal  support zone  at 364.00.

What's up traders, I hope you're all having a good trading week so far. Let's get straight into it! 

Ethereum -0.25%  is trading right on a side-wards resistance structure at 606, and has been trading at this level since 3rd June. Price is trading upwards along a side-wards support line, which has now converged into the side-wards resistance line. Price is at a juncture, and price needs to either break upwards, and break downwards. 

Supporting the upside, there is a side-wards support line thats recently formed, if price stays above this line, it will mean price is forced to break the side-wards resistance at 612.  

If price breaks the support  trend line , then we can expect some downside. If price breaks the support  trend line , AND also hits the side-wards  resistance level , then it is a good sell opportunity. 

There is 2 outcomes for  Ethereum -0.25%  in the short term. They are: 

- If price goes below 597.65 and closes there, then I am expecting downside to continue to 497.40 (Where there is some localized structure which could act as support) or the lower horizontal  support zone  at 364.00. 
- Price stays above 597.65 and breaks out of the side-wards resistance. If this happens, there will be a retest on the side-wards resistance line turned support and then break to the upside.

 ETHUSD -0.23%  update: The slow grind is a pleasant market to watch if you are managing positions over the long term. If you are trying to open a new position, it can be very hard to watch because it can turn at any point, but slowly continues higher. What is not obvious is the risk of retrace which I will talk more about in this report. 

Price is about to retest the 625 resistance (.382 of recent  bearish  swing). This level has previously proven to attract selling activity. The question is do these bears return? The higher low established at 575 indicates that price is more likely to push higher, but this is where the risk of retrace comes into play. 

The 641 reversal zone boundary is relative to the 628 high and is the area to watch for  bearish  formations IF a fake out is in order for these markets.  

Keep in mind, this is not a prediction, it is a scenario to be prepared for. If the newly established  bullish trend line  stays intact, this market may be on its way to a new high and a decisive close above the 628 level. This will change the short term outlook from  bearish  to  bullish .  

At S.C., we are not taking any new swing trade longs because price is too close to resistance levels. We would rather miss the low probability trade, even if it works out this time. We know that in the long run, the same trade would produce inconsistent results and that is not in line with our goal.

Something different. No indicators. Just looking at price action on different time frames and looking for areas of previous activity. 

There's a lot going on here at first glance but it's not that crazy when you dive in. I started by looking at the most recent price movement. Here is the 1 hour chart for eth starting in April. We get a 5 wave structure up with the horizontal lines showing the top and the bottom of our current channel. We're looking for a corrective wave two that doesn't retrace 1 by more than 100 percent. If it does we look for a different count. 

So the current story becomes, is the 2 in? Here I have labeled a theory that says, yes, yes it is.  Doesn't mean it's true. 

Here's my thought process; the move down could be counted as a 12345 which would make it the A, then B bounces up to 550 or so, and then C corrects down below A meaning eth dips below 500 again. This would certainly still be a valid count but I started to look at areas with lots of price action recently and saw two channels. Our current channel in green and the previous channel in red. In blue are the time frames where the price shifted from one channel to the other. I suspect a third one to be coming soon. There's just so much price history in these areas that I think it's likely to return there. There are psychological and mathematical reasons for this but that discussion is for another time but I'll summarize by stating a true trope: Markets have memories. 

Is it possible that we break  bearish  out of the current channel? Most definitely. And it very well may. There are some funky waves to interpret and I'm sure different  Elliott  traders will see things differently.

I suppose, the growth is delayed. Current structure still can be an impuls only after sweeping move above 630 on high volumes. 
But. More realistic would be a continuetion of a flat like I sketched out. Because volumes on top 3 cryptocurrencies are very low, it doesn't look like before the growth. Also alts made  zig-zag  correction from the lows of 28th of May. And even more alts made impulses downwards 4-5 of June. 
Still some small growth can be in this case, but without significant changes in the essence.

ETH/USD overview. Just take a look on chart, price is so close to key level $628 from which cryptocurrency rate bounced several times. That level is a key zone for big players. You can open short near $628 with goal $400.  

If price will move down, it could go to $400. But for us that would be the greatest opportunity to buy ETH for so low price.  

I need to explain you, why I think only for short, at this moment. As you know there is no news around cryptocurrency. We have silents. It's a signal that Big players accumulate their positions. They do it in a Range moves. They wait till retail traders will get tired to wait, and sell all their positions for a low price. There could be a big moving after huge range. I see that pattern on every marker on Stock, FX and Crypto too.

My proposed wave in red may be far too conservative in both time and price movement estimations. 

Markets mirror previous actions. Cycles repeat with variation. Repetition and variation create rhythm. Habits are the rhythms of human life. Markets are reflections of humans. Charts are markers along the path.

ETH/USD overview. Just take a look on chart, price is so close to key level $628 from which cryptocurrency rate bounced several times. That level is a key zone for big players. You can open short near $628 with goal $400.  

If price will move down, it could go to $400. But for us that would be the greatest opportunity to buy ETH for so low price.  

I need to explain you, why I think only for short, at this moment. As you know there is no news around cryptocurrency. We have silents. It's a signal that Big players accumulate their positions. They do it in a Range moves. They wait till retail traders will get tired to wait, and sell all their positions for a low price. There could be a big moving after huge range.

What's up traders, I hope you're all having a good trading week so far. Let's get straight into it! 

Ethereum -0.08%  is trading right on a side-wards resistance structure at 606, and has been trading at this level since 3rd June. Price is trading upwards along a side-wards support line, which has now converged into the side-wards resistance line. Price is at a juncture, and price needs to either break upwards, and break downwards. 

Supporting the upside, there is a side-wards support line thats recently formed, if price stays above this line, it will mean price is forced to break the side-wards resistance at 612.  

If price breaks the support  trend line , then we can expect some downside. If price breaks the support  trend line , AND also hits the side-wards  resistance level , then it is a good sell opportunity. 

There is 2 outcomes for  Ethereum -0.08%  in the short term. They are: 

- If price goes below 597.65 and closes there, then I am expecting downside to continue to 497.40 (Where there is some localized structure which could act as support) or the lower horizontal  support zone  at 364.00. 
- Price stays above 597.65 and breaks out of the side-wards resistance. If this happens, there will be a retest on the side-wards resistance line turned support and then break to the upside.

 ETHUSD -0.08%  update: The slow grind is a pleasant market to watch if you are managing positions over the long term. If you are trying to open a new position, it can be very hard to watch because it can turn at any point, but slowly continues higher. What is not obvious is the risk of retrace which I will talk more about in this report. 

Price is about to retest the 625 resistance (.382 of recent  bearish  swing). This level has previously proven to attract selling activity. The question is do these bears return? The higher low established at 575 indicates that price is more likely to push higher, but this is where the risk of retrace comes into play. 

The 641 reversal zone boundary is relative to the 628 high and is the area to watch for  bearish  formations IF a fake out is in order for these markets.  

Keep in mind, this is not a prediction, it is a scenario to be prepared for. If the newly established  bullish trend line  stays intact, this market may be on its way to a new high and a decisive close above the 628 level. This will change the short term outlook from  bearish  to  bullish .

First had a downtrending channel, recently price broke out of this channel, but finds it hard to break clearly. 
Matching up a zone of resistance and an area that looks like a double shoulder head and shoulder pattern, price is more likely to go down and test the lows for a potential bottom in the market.

Something different. No indicators. Just looking at price action on different time frames and looking for areas of previous activity. 

There's a lot going on here at first glance but it's not that crazy when you dive in. I started by looking at the most recent price movement. Here is the 1 hour chart for eth starting in April. We get a 5 wave structure up with the horizontal lines showing the top and the bottom of our current channel. We're looking for a corrective wave two that doesn't retrace 1 by more than 100 percent. If it does we look for a different count. 

So the current story becomes, is the 2 in? Here I have labeled a theory that says, yes, yes it is.  Doesn't mean it's true. 

Here's my thought process; the move down could be counted as a 12345 which would make it the A, then B bounces up to 550 or so, and then C corrects down below A meaning eth dips below 500 again. This would certainly still be a valid count but I started to look at areas with lots of price action recently and saw two channels. Our current channel in green and the previous channel in red. In blue are the time frames where the price shifted from one channel to the other. I suspect a third one to be coming soon. There's just so much price history in these areas that I think it's likely to return there. There are psychological and mathematical reasons for this but that discussion is for another time but I'll summarize by stating a true trope: Markets have memories. 

Is it possible that we break  bearish  out of the current channel? Most definitely. And it very well may. There are some funky waves to interpret and I'm sure different  Elliott  traders will see things differently. 

I'm looking from different perspectives to try to carve out the narrative.

A combined  hammer  formed on the 28th and 29th of last month (when combining the two candles, a strong  hammer  forms) ended the recent sell off for now. 

Now market is against a better  resistance zone  between 625 and 635; not only the 38,2%  Fibonacci retracement  level but also previous horizontal support from earlier this in may (see up arrows). Against this resistance, a combined  shooting star  has formed. The fact that market is keeping steady after this may imply upside is not done for now and market is just consolidating recent gains. But this has to be confirmed with a better move over 635. 

As long as dips hold toward 575 support one may expect such a move; 700 is implied after this.

So the current story becomes, is the 2 in? Here I have labeled a theory that says, yes, yes it is.  Doesn't mean it's true. 

Here's my thought process; the move down could be counted as a 12345 which would make it the A, then B bounces up to 550 or so, and then C corrects down below A meaning eth dips below 500 again. This would certainly still be a valid count but I started to look at areas with lots of price action recently and saw two channels. Our current channel in green and the previous channel in red. In blue are the time frames where the price shifted from one channel to the other. I suspect a third one to be coming soon. There's just so much price history in these areas that I think it's likely to return there. There are psychological and mathematical reasons for this but that discussion is for another time but I'll summarize by stating a true trope: Markets have memories. 

Is it possible that we break  bearish  out of the current channel? Most definitely. And it very well may. There are some funky waves to interpret and I'm sure different  Elliott  traders will see things differently.

What's up traders, I hope you're all having a good trading week so far. Let's get straight into it! 

Ethereum -0.05%  is trading right on a side-wards resistance structure at 606, and has been trading at this level since 3rd June. Price is trading upwards along a side-wards support line, which has now converged into the side-wards resistance line. Price is at a juncture, and price needs to either break upwards, and break downwards. 

Supporting the upside, there is a side-wards support line thats recently formed, if price stays above this line, it will mean price is forced to break the side-wards resistance at 612.  

If price breaks the support  trend line , then we can expect some downside. If price breaks the support  trend line , AND also hits the side-wards  resistance level , then it is a good sell opportunity. 

There is 2 outcomes for  Ethereum -0.05%  in the short term. They are: 

- If price goes below 597.65 and closes there, then I am expecting downside to continue to 497.40 (Where there is some localized structure which could act as support) or the lower horizontal  support zone  at 364.00. 
- Price stays above 597.65 and breaks out of the side-wards resistance. If this happens, there will be a retest on the side-wards resistance line turned support and then break to the upside.

 ETHUSD -0.05%  update: The slow grind is a pleasant market to watch if you are managing positions over the long term. If you are trying to open a new position, it can be very hard to watch because it can turn at any point, but slowly continues higher. What is not obvious is the risk of retrace which I will talk more about in this report. 

Price is about to retest the 625 resistance (.382 of recent  bearish  swing). This level has previously proven to attract selling activity. The question is do these bears return? The higher low established at 575 indicates that price is more likely to push higher, but this is where the risk of retrace comes into play. 

The 641 reversal zone boundary is relative to the 628 high and is the area to watch for  bearish  formations IF a fake out is in order for these markets.  

Keep in mind, this is not a prediction, it is a scenario to be prepared for. If the newly established  bullish trend line  stays intact, this market may be on its way to a new high and a decisive close above the 628 level. This will change the short term outlook from  bearish  to  bullish .

This is almost exactly the same post as my BTCUDSD post for the day.  An indicator that I like to use to help see through the noise is the Hull  MACD , which is a difficult indicator to use because they are not a lot of resources on it.  But generally a  bearish  cross is a  bearish  cross.  I highlighted in yellow what the H-MACD looks like when you are moving through a bubble and we certainly don't see that behavior.  In other words, this  bearish  cross will tend to bring the prices down. We may see this  bearish  cross on the H-MACD cause some convergence on the normal  MACD  leading to a  bearish  cross there, which I have highlighted a previous example in blue.    

Additionally the 1h chart has some  bearish  divergence setting in.   This peak is lower than the last and we had to get the  bearish  divergence to do this.  The overall sentiment has not been enough to give this upswing any real momentum.  This isn't quite enough for me to go short but I am thinking about it.  But both the micro and  daily charts  look poor enough that my optimism has turned to neutral (at the very best).

First had a downtrending channel, recently price broke out of this channel, but finds it hard to break clearly. 
Matching up a zone of resistance and an area that looks like a double shoulder head and shoulder pattern, price is more likely to go down and test the lows for a potential bottom in the market. 

Conclusion: View is neutral until it either breaks the 630 or 490 barrier. Shorter term views, a more negative outlook, maybe price will retest at 630 and then drop off.

Something different. No indicators. Just looking at price action on different time frames and looking for areas of previous activity. 

There's a lot going on here at first glance but it's not that crazy when you dive in. I started by looking at the most recent price movement. Here is the 1 hour chart for eth starting in April. We get a 5 wave structure up with the horizontal lines showing the top and the bottom of our current channel. We're looking for a corrective wave two that doesn't retrace 1 by more than 100 percent. If it does we look for a different count. 

So the current story becomes, is the 2 in? Here I have labeled a theory that says, yes, yes it is.  Doesn't mean it's true. 

Here's my thought process; the move down could be counted as a 12345 which would make it the A, then B bounces up to 550 or so, and then C corrects down below A meaning eth dips below 500 again. This would certainly still be a valid count but I started to look at areas with lots of price action recently and saw two channels. Our current channel in green and the previous channel in red. In blue are the time frames where the price shifted from one channel to the other. I suspect a third one to be coming soon. There's just so much price history in these areas that I think it's likely to return there. There are psychological and mathematical reasons for this but that discussion is for another time but I'll summarize by stating a true trope: Markets have memories. 

Is it possible that we break  bearish  out of the current channel? Most definitely. And it very well may. There are some funky waves to interpret and I'm sure different  Elliott  traders will see things differently.

This is almost exactly the same post as my BTCUDSD post for the day.  An indicator that I like to use to help see through the noise is the Hull  MACD , which is a difficult indicator to use because they are not a lot of resources on it.  But generally a  bearish  cross is a  bearish  cross.  I highlighted in yellow what the H-MACD looks like when you are moving through a bubble and we certainly don't see that behavior.  In other words, this  bearish  cross will tend to bring the prices down. We may see this  bearish  cross on the H-MACD cause some convergence on the normal  MACD  leading to a  bearish  cross there, which I have highlighted a previous example in blue.    

Additionally the 1h chart has some  bearish  divergence setting in.   This peak is lower than the last and we had to get the  bearish  divergence to do this.  The overall sentiment has not been enough to give this upswing any real momentum.  This isn't quite enough for me to go short but I am thinking about it.  But both the micro and  daily charts  look poor enough that my optimism has turned to neutral (at the very best).

First had a downtrending channel, recently price broke out of this channel, but finds it hard to break clearly. 
Matching up a zone of resistance and an area that looks like a double shoulder head and shoulder pattern, price is more likely to go down and test the lows for a potential bottom in the market. 

Conclusion: View is neutral until it either breaks the 630 or 490 barrier. Shorter term views, a more negative outlook, maybe price will retest at 630 and then drop off.

Something different. No indicators. Just looking at price action on different time frames and looking for areas of previous activity. 

There's a lot going on here at first glance but it's not that crazy when you dive in. I started by looking at the most recent price movement. Here is the 1 hour chart for eth starting in April. We get a 5 wave structure up with the horizontal lines showing the top and the bottom of our current channel. We're looking for a corrective wave two that doesn't retrace 1 by more than 100 percent. If it does we look for a different count. 

So the current story becomes, is the 2 in? Here I have labeled a theory that says, yes, yes it is.  Doesn't mean it's true. 

Here's my thought process; the move down could be counted as a 12345 which would make it the A, then B bounces up to 550 or so, and then C corrects down below A meaning eth dips below 500 again. This would certainly still be a valid count but I started to look at areas with lots of price action recently and saw two channels. Our current channel in green and the previous channel in red. In blue are the time frames where the price shifted from one channel to the other. I suspect a third one to be coming soon. There's just so much price history in these areas that I think it's likely to return there. There are psychological and mathematical reasons for this but that discussion is for another time but I'll summarize by stating a true trope: Markets have memories. 

Is it possible that we break  bearish  out of the current channel? Most definitely. And it very well may. There are some funky waves to interpret and I'm sure different  Elliott  traders will see things differently. 

I'm looking from different perspectives to try to carve out the narrative.

What's up traders, I hope you're all having a good trading week so far. Let's get straight into it! 

Ethereum -0.28%  is trading right on a side-wards resistance structure at 606, and has been trading at this level since 3rd June. Price is trading upwards along a side-wards support line, which has now converged into the side-wards resistance line. Price is at a juncture, and price needs to either break upwards, and break downwards. 

Supporting the upside, there is a side-wards support line thats recently formed, if price stays above this line, it will mean price is forced to break the side-wards resistance at 612.  

If price breaks the support  trend line , then we can expect some downside. If price breaks the support  trend line , AND also hits the side-wards  resistance level , then it is a good sell opportunity. 

There is 2 outcomes for  Ethereum -0.28%  in the short term. They are: 

- If price goes below 597.65 and closes there, then I am expecting downside to continue to 497.40 (Where there is some localized structure which could act as support) or the lower horizontal  support zone  at 364.00. 
- Price stays above 597.65 and breaks out of the side-wards resistance. If this happens, there will be a retest on the side-wards resistance line turned support and then break to the upside.

 ETHUSD -0.28%  update: The slow grind is a pleasant market to watch if you are managing positions over the long term. If you are trying to open a new position, it can be very hard to watch because it can turn at any point, but slowly continues higher. What is not obvious is the risk of retrace which I will talk more about in this report. 

Price is about to retest the 625 resistance (.382 of recent  bearish  swing). This level has previously proven to attract selling activity. The question is do these bears return? The higher low established at 575 indicates that price is more likely to push higher, but this is where the risk of retrace comes into play. 

The 641 reversal zone boundary is relative to the 628 high and is the area to watch for  bearish  formations IF a fake out is in order for these markets.  

Keep in mind, this is not a prediction, it is a scenario to be prepared for. If the newly established  bullish trend line  stays intact, this market may be on its way to a new high and a decisive close above the 628 level. This will change the short term outlook from  bearish  to  bullish .  

At S.C., we are not taking any new swing trade longs because price is too close to resistance levels. We would rather miss the low probability trade, even if it works out this time. We know that in the long run, the same trade would produce inconsistent results and that is not in line with our goal. 

Our plan is to wait for better prices which means a retest of 575 would have to happen. If price continues higher, then we will be evaluating for the next swing trade long opportunity.

Price is about to retest the 625 resistance (.382 of recent  bearish  swing). This level has previously proven to attract selling activity. The question is do these bears return? The higher low established at 575 indicates that price is more likely to push higher, but this is where the risk of retrace comes into play. 

The 641 reversal zone boundary is relative to the 628 high and is the area to watch for  bearish  formations IF a fake out is in order for these markets.  

Keep in mind, this is not a prediction, it is a scenario to be prepared for. If the newly established  bullish trend line  stays intact, this market may be on its way to a new high and a decisive close above the 628 level. This will change the short term outlook from  bearish  to  bullish .  

At S.C., we are not taking any new swing trade longs because price is too close to resistance levels. We would rather miss the low probability trade, even if it works out this time. We know that in the long run, the same trade would produce inconsistent results and that is not in line with our goal. 

Our plan is to wait for better prices which means a retest of 575 would have to happen. If price continues higher, then we will be evaluating for the next swing trade long opportunity.

This is almost exactly the same post as my BTCUDSD post for the day.  An indicator that I like to use to help see through the noise is the Hull  MACD , which is a difficult indicator to use because they are not a lot of resources on it.  But generally a  bearish  cross is a  bearish  cross.  I highlighted in yellow what the H-MACD looks like when you are moving through a bubble and we certainly don't see that behavior.  In other words, this  bearish  cross will tend to bring the prices down. We may see this  bearish  cross on the H-MACD cause some convergence on the normal  MACD  leading to a  bearish  cross there, which I have highlighted a previous example in blue.    

Additionally the 1h chart has some  bearish  divergence setting in.   This peak is lower than the last and we had to get the  bearish  divergence to do this.  The overall sentiment has not been enough to give this upswing any real momentum.  This isn't quite enough for me to go short but I am thinking about it.

First had a downtrending channel, recently price broke out of this channel, but finds it hard to break clearly.

Something different. No indicators. Just looking at price action on different time frames and looking for areas of previous activity. 

There's a lot going on here at first glance but it's not that crazy when you dive in. I started by looking at the most recent price movement. Here is the 1 hour chart for eth starting in April. We get a 5 wave structure up with the horizontal lines showing the top and the bottom of our current channel. We're looking for a corrective wave two that doesn't retrace 1 by more than 100 percent. If it does we look for a different count. 

So the current story becomes, is the 2 in? Here I have labeled a theory that says, yes, yes it is.  Doesn't mean it's true. 

Here's my thought process; the move down could be counted as a 12345 which would make it the A, then B bounces up to 550 or so, and then C corrects down below A meaning eth dips below 500 again. This would certainly still be a valid count but I started to look at areas with lots of price action recently and saw two channels. Our current channel in green and the previous channel in red. In blue are the time frames where the price shifted from one channel to the other. I suspect a third one to be coming soon. There's just so much price history in these areas that I think it's likely to return there. There are psychological and mathematical reasons for this but that discussion is for another time but I'll summarize by stating a true trope: Markets have memories. 

Is it possible that we break  bearish  out of the current channel? Most definitely. And it very well may. There are some funky waves to interpret and I'm sure different  Elliott  traders will see things differently.

The price is below the green ascending  trend line . The possible ways for  Ethereum -0.28%  are the following: 
1.	Red scenario ( bearish ). ETH/USD will move towards the closest  support area  at $596.08 and break through it targeting the next  support area  at $566.90. 
2.	Orange scenario (neutral).  Ethereum -0.28%  will stay within the current range, limited by the  support area  at $596.08 and the closest  resistance area  at $626.66 without significant price changes. 
3.	Green scenario ( bullish ). The currency pair will break through $626.66 targeting the next  resistance area  at $662.39, which coincides with the 1 retracement level.

What's up traders, I hope you're all having a good trading week so far. Let's get straight into it! 

Ethereum -0.28%  is trading right on a side-wards resistance structure at 606, and has been trading at this level since 3rd June. Price is trading upwards along a side-wards support line, which has now converged into the side-wards resistance line. Price is at a juncture, and price needs to either break upwards, and break downwards. 

Supporting the upside, there is a side-wards support line thats recently formed, if price stays above this line, it will mean price is forced to break the side-wards resistance at 612.  

If price breaks the support  trend line , then we can expect some downside. If price breaks the support  trend line , AND also hits the side-wards  resistance level , then it is a good sell opportunity. 

There is 2 outcomes for  Ethereum -0.28%  in the short term. They are: 

- If price goes below 597.65 and closes there, then I am expecting downside to continue to 497.40 (Where there is some localized structure which could act as support) or the lower horizontal  support zone  at 364.00. 
- Price stays above 597.65 and breaks out of the side-wards resistance. If this happens, there will be a retest on the side-wards resistance line turned support and then break to the upside. 

Please show your support and leave a like and follow - I'd really appreciate it! :-)

The price is below the green ascending  trend line . The possible ways for  Ethereum -0.28%  are the following: 
1.	Red scenario ( bearish ). ETH/USD will move towards the closest  support area  at $596.08 and break through it targeting the next  support area  at $566.90. 
2.	Orange scenario (neutral).  Ethereum -0.28%  will stay within the current range, limited by the  support area  at $596.08 and the closest  resistance area  at $626.66 without significant price changes. 
3.	Green scenario ( bullish ). The currency pair will break through $626.66 targeting the next  resistance area  at $662.39, which coincides with the 1 retracement level.

What's up traders, I hope you're all having a good trading week so far. Let's get straight into it! 

Ethereum -0.28%  is trading right on a side-wards resistance structure at 606, and has been trading at this level since 3rd June. Price is trading upwards along a side-wards support line, which has now converged into the side-wards resistance line. Price is at a juncture, and price needs to either break upwards, and break downwards. 

Supporting the upside, there is a side-wards support line thats recently formed, if price stays above this line, it will mean price is forced to break the side-wards resistance at 612.  

If price breaks the support  trend line , then we can expect some downside. If price breaks the support  trend line , AND also hits the side-wards  resistance level , then it is a good sell opportunity. 

There is 2 outcomes for  Ethereum -0.28%  in the short term. They are: 

- If price goes below 597.65 and closes there, then I am expecting downside to continue to 497.40 (Where there is some localized structure which could act as support) or the lower horizontal  support zone  at 364.00. 
- Price stays above 597.65 and breaks out of the side-wards resistance. If this happens, there will be a retest on the side-wards resistance line turned support and then break to the upside. 

Please show your support and leave a like and follow - I'd really appreciate it! :-)

 ETHUSD -0.28%  update: The slow grind is a pleasant market to watch if you are managing positions over the long term. If you are trying to open a new position, it can be very hard to watch because it can turn at any point, but slowly continues higher. What is not obvious is the risk of retrace which I will talk more about in this report. 

Price is about to retest the 625 resistance (.382 of recent  bearish  swing). This level has previously proven to attract selling activity. The question is do these bears return? The higher low established at 575 indicates that price is more likely to push higher, but this is where the risk of retrace comes into play. 

The 641 reversal zone boundary is relative to the 628 high and is the area to watch for  bearish  formations IF a fake out is in order for these markets.  

Keep in mind, this is not a prediction, it is a scenario to be prepared for. If the newly established  bullish trend line  stays intact, this market may be on its way to a new high and a decisive close above the 628 level. This will change the short term outlook from  bearish  to  bullish .  

At S.C., we are not taking any new swing trade longs because price is too close to resistance levels. We would rather miss the low probability trade, even if it works out this time. We know that in the long run, the same trade would produce inconsistent results and that is not in line with our goal. 

Our plan is to wait for better prices which means a retest of 575 would have to happen. If price continues higher, then we will be evaluating for the next swing trade long opportunity.

This is almost exactly the same post as my BTCUDSD post for the day.  An indicator that I like to use to help see through the noise is the Hull  MACD , which is a difficult indicator to use because they are not a lot of resources on it.  But generally a  bearish  cross is a  bearish  cross.  I highlighted in yellow what the H-MACD looks like when you are moving through a bubble and we certainly don't see that behavior.  In other words, this  bearish  cross will tend to bring the prices down. We may see this  bearish  cross on the H-MACD cause some convergence on the normal  MACD  leading to a  bearish  cross there, which I have highlighted a previous example in blue.    

Additionally the 1h chart has some  bearish  divergence setting in.   This peak is lower than the last and we had to get the  bearish  divergence to do this.  The overall sentiment has not been enough to give this upswing any real momentum.  This isn't quite enough for me to go short but I am thinking about it.

Something different. No indicators. Just looking at price action on different time frames and looking for areas of previous activity. 

There's a lot going on here at first glance but it's not that crazy when you dive in. I started by looking at the most recent price movement. Here is the 1 hour chart for eth starting in April. We get a 5 wave structure up with the horizontal lines showing the top and the bottom of our current channel. We're looking for a corrective wave two that doesn't retrace 1 by more than 100 percent. If it does we look for a different count. 

So the current story becomes, is the 2 in? Here I have labeled a theory that says, yes, yes it is.  Doesn't mean it's true. 

Here's my thought process; the move down could be counted as a 12345 which would make it the A, then B bounces up to 550 or so, and then C corrects down below A meaning eth dips below 500 again. This would certainly still be a valid count but I started to look at areas with lots of price action recently and saw two channels. Our current channel in green and the previous channel in red. In blue are the time frames where the price shifted from one channel to the other. I suspect a third one to be coming soon. There's just so much price history in these areas that I think it's likely to return there. There are psychological and mathematical reasons for this but that discussion is for another time but I'll summarize by stating a true trope: Markets have memories. 

Is it possible that we break  bearish  out of the current channel? Most definitely. And it very well may. There are some funky waves to interpret and I'm sure different  Elliott  traders will see things differently.

What's up traders, I hope you're all having a good trading week so far. Let's get straight into it! 

Ethereum -0.35%  is trading right on a side-wards resistance structure at 606, and has been trading at this level since 3rd June. Price is trading upwards along a side-wards support line, which has now converged into the side-wards resistance line. Price is at a juncture, and price needs to either break upwards, and break downwards. 

Supporting the upside, there is a side-wards support line thats recently formed, if price stays above this line, it will mean price is forced to break the side-wards resistance at 612.  

If price breaks the support  trend line , then we can expect some downside. If price breaks the support  trend line , AND also hits the side-wards  resistance level , then it is a good sell opportunity. 

There is 2 outcomes for  Ethereum -0.35%  in the short term. They are: 

- If price goes below 597.65 and closes there, then I am expecting downside to continue to 497.40 (Where there is some localized structure which could act as support) or the lower horizontal  support zone  at 364.00. 
- Price stays above 597.65 and breaks out of the side-wards resistance. If this happens, there will be a retest on the side-wards resistance line turned support and then break to the upside.

 ETHUSD -0.35%  update: The slow grind is a pleasant market to watch if you are managing positions over the long term. If you are trying to open a new position, it can be very hard to watch because it can turn at any point, but slowly continues higher. What is not obvious is the risk of retrace which I will talk more about in this report. 

Price is about to retest the 625 resistance (.382 of recent  bearish  swing). This level has previously proven to attract selling activity. The question is do these bears return? The higher low established at 575 indicates that price is more likely to push higher, but this is where the risk of retrace comes into play. 

The 641 reversal zone boundary is relative to the 628 high and is the area to watch for  bearish  formations IF a fake out is in order for these markets.  

Keep in mind, this is not a prediction, it is a scenario to be prepared for. If the newly established  bullish trend line  stays intact, this market may be on its way to a new high and a decisive close above the 628 level. This will change the short term outlook from  bearish  to  bullish .  

At S.C., we are not taking any new swing trade longs because price is too close to resistance levels. We would rather miss the low probability trade, even if it works out this time. We know that in the long run, the same trade would produce inconsistent results and that is not in line with our goal.

Something different. No indicators. Just looking at price action on different time frames and looking for areas of previous activity. 

There's a lot going on here at first glance but it's not that crazy when you dive in. I started by looking at the most recent price movement. Here is the 1 hour chart for eth starting in April. We get a 5 wave structure up with the horizontal lines showing the top and the bottom of our current channel. We're looking for a corrective wave two that doesn't retrace 1 by more than 100 percent. If it does we look for a different count. 

So the current story becomes, is the 2 in? Here I have labeled a theory that says, yes, yes it is.  Doesn't mean it's true. 

Here's my thought process; the move down could be counted as a 12345 which would make it the A, then B bounces up to 550 or so, and then C corrects down below A meaning eth dips below 500 again. This would certainly still be a valid count but I started to look at areas with lots of price action recently and saw two channels. Our current channel in green and the previous channel in red. In blue are the time frames where the price shifted from one channel to the other. I suspect a third one to be coming soon. There's just so much price history in these areas that I think it's likely to return there. There are psychological and mathematical reasons for this but that discussion is for another time but I'll summarize by stating a true trope: Markets have memories. 

Is it possible that we break  bearish  out of the current channel? Most definitely. And it very well may. There are some funky waves to interpret and I'm sure different  Elliott  traders will see things differently.

A combined  hammer  formed on the 28th and 29th of last month (when combining the two candles, a strong  hammer  forms) ended the recent sell off for now. 

Now market is against a better  resistance zone  between 625 and 635; not only the 38,2%  Fibonacci retracement  level but also previous horizontal support from earlier this in may (see up arrows). Against this resistance, a combined  shooting star  has formed. The fact that market is keeping steady after this may imply upside is not done for now and market is just consolidating recent gains. But this has to be confirmed with a better move over 635.

I suppose, the growth is delayed. Current structure still can be an impuls only after sweeping move above 630 on high volumes. 
But. More realistic would be a continuetion of a flat like I sketched out. Because volumes on top 3 cryptocurrencies are very low, it doesn't look like before the growth. Also alts made  zig-zag  correction from the lows of 28th of May. And even more alts made impulses downwards 4-5 of June. 
Still some small growth can be in this case, but without significant changes in the essence.

ETH/USD overview. Just take a look on chart, price is so close to key level $628 from which cryptocurrency rate bounced several times. That level is a key zone for big players. You can open short near $628 with goal $400.  

If price will move down, it could go to $400. But for us that would be the greatest opportunity to buy ETH for so low price.  

I need to explain you, why I think only for short, at this moment. As you know there is no news around cryptocurrency. We have silents. It's a signal that Big players accumulate their positions. They do it in a Range moves. They wait till retail traders will get tired to wait, and sell all their positions for a low price. There could be a big moving after huge range. I see that pattern on every marker on Stock, FX and Crypto too.

ETH/USD overview. Just take a look on chart, price is so close to key level $628 from which cryptocurrency rate bounced several times. That level is a key zone for big players. You can open short near $628 with goal $400.  

If price will move down, it could go to $400. But for us that would be the greatest opportunity to buy ETH for so low price.  

I need to explain you, why I think only for short, at this moment. As you know there is no news around cryptocurrency. We have silents. It's a signal that Big players accumulate their positions. They do it in a Range moves. They wait till retail traders will get tired to wait, and sell all their positions for a low price. There could be a big moving after huge range.

What's up traders, I hope you're all having a good trading week so far. Let's get straight into it! 

Ethereum -0.38%  is trading right on a side-wards resistance structure at 606, and has been trading at this level since 3rd June. Price is trading upwards along a side-wards support line, which has now converged into the side-wards resistance line. Price is at a juncture, and price needs to either break upwards, and break downwards. 

Supporting the upside, there is a side-wards support line thats recently formed, if price stays above this line, it will mean price is forced to break the side-wards resistance at 612.  

If price breaks the support  trend line , then we can expect some downside. If price breaks the support  trend line , AND also hits the side-wards  resistance level , then it is a good sell opportunity. 

There is 2 outcomes for  Ethereum -0.38%  in the short term. They are: 

- If price goes below 597.65 and closes there, then I am expecting downside to continue to 497.40 (Where there is some localized structure which could act as support) or the lower horizontal  support zone  at 364.00. 
- Price stays above 597.65 and breaks out of the side-wards resistance. If this happens, there will be a retest on the side-wards resistance line turned support and then break to the upside.

 ETHUSD -0.38%  update: The slow grind is a pleasant market to watch if you are managing positions over the long term. If you are trying to open a new position, it can be very hard to watch because it can turn at any point, but slowly continues higher. What is not obvious is the risk of retrace which I will talk more about in this report. 

Price is about to retest the 625 resistance (.382 of recent  bearish  swing). This level has previously proven to attract selling activity. The question is do these bears return? The higher low established at 575 indicates that price is more likely to push higher, but this is where the risk of retrace comes into play. 

The 641 reversal zone boundary is relative to the 628 high and is the area to watch for  bearish  formations IF a fake out is in order for these markets.  

Keep in mind, this is not a prediction, it is a scenario to be prepared for. If the newly established  bullish trend line  stays intact, this market may be on its way to a new high and a decisive close above the 628 level. This will change the short term outlook from  bearish  to  bullish .

This is almost exactly the same post as my BTCUDSD post for the day.  An indicator that I like to use to help see through the noise is the Hull  MACD , which is a difficult indicator to use because they are not a lot of resources on it.  But generally a  bearish  cross is a  bearish  cross.  I highlighted in yellow what the H-MACD looks like when you are moving through a bubble and we certainly don't see that behavior.  In other words, this  bearish  cross will tend to bring the prices down. We may see this  bearish  cross on the H-MACD cause some convergence on the normal  MACD  leading to a  bearish  cross there, which I have highlighted a previous example in blue.    

Additionally the 1h chart has some  bearish  divergence setting in.   This peak is lower than the last and we had to get the  bearish  divergence to do this.  The overall sentiment has not been enough to give this upswing any real momentum.  This isn't quite enough for me to go short but I am thinking about it.

First had a downtrending channel, recently price broke out of this channel, but finds it hard to break clearly. 
Matching up a zone of resistance and an area that looks like a double shoulder head and shoulder pattern, price is more likely to go down and test the lows for a potential bottom in the market. 

Conclusion: View is neutral until it either breaks the 630 or 490 barrier. Shorter term views, a more negative outlook, maybe price will retest at 630 and then drop off.

Something different. No indicators. Just looking at price action on different time frames and looking for areas of previous activity. 

There's a lot going on here at first glance but it's not that crazy when you dive in. I started by looking at the most recent price movement. Here is the 1 hour chart for eth starting in April. We get a 5 wave structure up with the horizontal lines showing the top and the bottom of our current channel. We're looking for a corrective wave two that doesn't retrace 1 by more than 100 percent. If it does we look for a different count. 

So the current story becomes, is the 2 in? Here I have labeled a theory that says, yes, yes it is.  Doesn't mean it's true. 

Here's my thought process; the move down could be counted as a 12345 which would make it the A, then B bounces up to 550 or so, and then C corrects down below A meaning eth dips below 500 again. This would certainly still be a valid count but I started to look at areas with lots of price action recently and saw two channels. Our current channel in green and the previous channel in red. In blue are the time frames where the price shifted from one channel to the other. I suspect a third one to be coming soon. There's just so much price history in these areas that I think it's likely to return there. There are psychological and mathematical reasons for this but that discussion is for another time but I'll summarize by stating a true trope: Markets have memories. 

Is it possible that we break  bearish  out of the current channel? Most definitely. And it very well may. There are some funky waves to interpret and I'm sure different  Elliott  traders will see things differently. 

I'm looking from different perspectives to try to carve out the narrative.

First had a downtrending channel, recently price broke out of this channel, but finds it hard to break clearly. 
Matching up a zone of resistance and an area that looks like a double shoulder head and shoulder pattern, price is more likely to go down and test the lows for a potential bottom in the market.

Something different. No indicators. Just looking at price action on different time frames and looking for areas of previous activity. 

There's a lot going on here at first glance but it's not that crazy when you dive in. I started by looking at the most recent price movement. Here is the 1 hour chart for eth starting in April. We get a 5 wave structure up with the horizontal lines showing the top and the bottom of our current channel. We're looking for a corrective wave two that doesn't retrace 1 by more than 100 percent. If it does we look for a different count. 

So the current story becomes, is the 2 in? Here I have labeled a theory that says, yes, yes it is.  Doesn't mean it's true. 

Here's my thought process; the move down could be counted as a 12345 which would make it the A, then B bounces up to 550 or so, and then C corrects down below A meaning eth dips below 500 again. This would certainly still be a valid count but I started to look at areas with lots of price action recently and saw two channels. Our current channel in green and the previous channel in red. In blue are the time frames where the price shifted from one channel to the other. I suspect a third one to be coming soon. There's just so much price history in these areas that I think it's likely to return there. There are psychological and mathematical reasons for this but that discussion is for another time but I'll summarize by stating a true trope: Markets have memories. 

Is it possible that we break  bearish  out of the current channel? Most definitely. And it very well may. There are some funky waves to interpret and I'm sure different  Elliott  traders will see things differently. 

I'm looking from different perspectives to try to carve out the narrative.

What's up traders, I hope you're all having a good trading week so far. Let's get straight into it! 

Ethereum -0.33%  is trading right on a side-wards resistance structure at 606, and has been trading at this level since 3rd June. Price is trading upwards along a side-wards support line, which has now converged into the side-wards resistance line. Price is at a juncture, and price needs to either break upwards, and break downwards. 

Supporting the upside, there is a side-wards support line thats recently formed, if price stays above this line, it will mean price is forced to break the side-wards resistance at 612.  

If price breaks the support  trend line , then we can expect some downside. If price breaks the support  trend line , AND also hits the side-wards  resistance level , then it is a good sell opportunity. 

There is 2 outcomes for  Ethereum -0.33%  in the short term. They are: 

- If price goes below 597.65 and closes there, then I am expecting downside to continue to 497.40 (Where there is some localized structure which could act as support) or the lower horizontal  support zone  at 364.00. 
- Price stays above 597.65 and breaks out of the side-wards resistance. If this happens, there will be a retest on the side-wards resistance line turned support and then break to the upside.

 ETHUSD -0.33%  update: The slow grind is a pleasant market to watch if you are managing positions over the long term. If you are trying to open a new position, it can be very hard to watch because it can turn at any point, but slowly continues higher. What is not obvious is the risk of retrace which I will talk more about in this report. 

Price is about to retest the 625 resistance (.382 of recent  bearish  swing). This level has previously proven to attract selling activity. The question is do these bears return? The higher low established at 575 indicates that price is more likely to push higher, but this is where the risk of retrace comes into play. 

The 641 reversal zone boundary is relative to the 628 high and is the area to watch for  bearish  formations IF a fake out is in order for these markets.  

Keep in mind, this is not a prediction, it is a scenario to be prepared for. If the newly established  bullish trend line  stays intact, this market may be on its way to a new high and a decisive close above the 628 level. This will change the short term outlook from  bearish  to  bullish .

This is almost exactly the same post as my BTCUDSD post for the day.  An indicator that I like to use to help see through the noise is the Hull  MACD , which is a difficult indicator to use because they are not a lot of resources on it.  But generally a  bearish  cross is a  bearish  cross.  I highlighted in yellow what the H-MACD looks like when you are moving through a bubble and we certainly don't see that behavior.  In other words, this  bearish  cross will tend to bring the prices down. We may see this  bearish  cross on the H-MACD cause some convergence on the normal  MACD  leading to a  bearish  cross there, which I have highlighted a previous example in blue.    

Additionally the 1h chart has some  bearish  divergence setting in.   This peak is lower than the last and we had to get the  bearish  divergence to do this.  The overall sentiment has not been enough to give this upswing any real momentum.  This isn't quite enough for me to go short but I am thinking about it.

This is almost exactly the same post as my BTCUDSD post for the day.  An indicator that I like to use to help see through the noise is the Hull  MACD , which is a difficult indicator to use because they are not a lot of resources on it.  But generally a  bearish  cross is a  bearish  cross.  I highlighted in yellow what the H-MACD looks like when you are moving through a bubble and we certainly don't see that behavior.  In other words, this  bearish  cross will tend to bring the prices down. We may see this  bearish  cross on the H-MACD cause some convergence on the normal  MACD  leading to a  bearish  cross there, which I have highlighted a previous example in blue.    

Additionally the 1h chart has some  bearish  divergence setting in.   This peak is lower than the last and we had to get the  bearish  divergence to do this.  The overall sentiment has not been enough to give this upswing any real momentum.  This isn't quite enough for me to go short but I am thinking about it.

First had a downtrending channel, recently price broke out of this channel, but finds it hard to break clearly.

Something different. No indicators. Just looking at price action on different time frames and looking for areas of previous activity. 

There's a lot going on here at first glance but it's not that crazy when you dive in. I started by looking at the most recent price movement. Here is the 1 hour chart for eth starting in April. We get a 5 wave structure up with the horizontal lines showing the top and the bottom of our current channel. We're looking for a corrective wave two that doesn't retrace 1 by more than 100 percent. If it does we look for a different count. 

So the current story becomes, is the 2 in? Here I have labeled a theory that says, yes, yes it is.  Doesn't mean it's true. 

Here's my thought process; the move down could be counted as a 12345 which would make it the A, then B bounces up to 550 or so, and then C corrects down below A meaning eth dips below 500 again. This would certainly still be a valid count but I started to look at areas with lots of price action recently and saw two channels. Our current channel in green and the previous channel in red. In blue are the time frames where the price shifted from one channel to the other. I suspect a third one to be coming soon. There's just so much price history in these areas that I think it's likely to return there. There are psychological and mathematical reasons for this but that discussion is for another time but I'll summarize by stating a true trope: Markets have memories. 

Is it possible that we break  bearish  out of the current channel? Most definitely. And it very well may. There are some funky waves to interpret and I'm sure different  Elliott  traders will see things differently. 

I'm looking from different perspectives to try to carve out the narrative.

What's up traders, I hope you're all having a good trading week so far. Let's get straight into it! 

Ethereum -0.44%  is trading right on a side-wards resistance structure at 606, and has been trading at this level since 3rd June. Price is trading upwards along a side-wards support line, which has now converged into the side-wards resistance line. Price is at a juncture, and price needs to either break upwards, and break downwards. 

Supporting the upside, there is a side-wards support line thats recently formed, if price stays above this line, it will mean price is forced to break the side-wards resistance at 612.  

If price breaks the support  trend line , then we can expect some downside. If price breaks the support  trend line , AND also hits the side-wards  resistance level , then it is a good sell opportunity. 

There is 2 outcomes for  Ethereum -0.44%  in the short term. They are: 

- If price goes below 597.65 and closes there, then I am expecting downside to continue to 497.40 (Where there is some localized structure which could act as support) or the lower horizontal  support zone  at 364.00. 
- Price stays above 597.65 and breaks out of the side-wards resistance. If this happens, there will be a retest on the side-wards resistance line turned support and then break to the upside. 

Please show your support and leave a like and follow - I'd really appreciate it! :-)

703,1528343739.0,MarcPMarkets,ETHUSD: Poised To Break Higher But 641 Points To Vulnerability.,"
 ETHUSD -0.44%  update: The slow grind is a pleasant market to watch if you are managing positions over the long term. If you are trying to open a new position, it can be very hard to watch because it can turn at any point, but slowly continues higher. What is not obvious is the risk of retrace which I will talk more about in this report. 

Price is about to retest the 625 resistance (.382 of recent  bearish  swing). This level has previously proven to attract selling activity. The question is do these bears return? The higher low established at 575 indicates that price is more likely to push higher, but this is where the risk of retrace comes into play. 

The 641 reversal zone boundary is relative to the 628 high and is the area to watch for  bearish  formations IF a fake out is in order for these markets.  

Keep in mind, this is not a prediction, it is a scenario to be prepared for. If the newly established  bullish trend line  stays intact, this market may be on its way to a new high and a decisive close above the 628 level. This will change the short term outlook from  bearish  to  bullish .  

At S.C., we are not taking any new swing trade longs because price is too close to resistance levels. We would rather miss the low probability trade, even if it works out this time. We know that in the long run, the same trade would produce inconsistent results and that is not in line with our goal. 

Our plan is to wait for better prices which means a retest of 575 would have to happen. If price continues higher, then we will be evaluating for the next swing trade long opportunity.

There is 2 outcomes for  Ethereum -0.51%  in the short term. They are: 

- If price goes below 597.65 and closes there, then I am expecting downside to continue to 497.40 (Where there is some localized structure which could act as support) or the lower horizontal  support zone  at 364.00.

 ETHUSD -0.51%  update: The slow grind is a pleasant market to watch if you are managing positions over the long term. If you are trying to open a new position, it can be very hard to watch because it can turn at any point, but slowly continues higher. What is not obvious is the risk of retrace which I will talk more about in this report. 

Price is about to retest the 625 resistance (.382 of recent  bearish  swing). This level has previously proven to attract selling activity. The question is do these bears return? The higher low established at 575 indicates that price is more likely to push higher, but this is where the risk of retrace comes into play. 

The 641 reversal zone boundary is relative to the 628 high and is the area to watch for  bearish  formations IF a fake out is in order for these markets.  

Keep in mind, this is not a prediction, it is a scenario to be prepared for. If the newly established  bullish trend line  stays intact, this market may be on its way to a new high and a decisive close above the 628 level. This will change the short term outlook from  bearish  to  bullish .  

At S.C., we are not taking any new swing trade longs because price is too close to resistance levels. We would rather miss the low probability trade, even if it works out this time. We know that in the long run, the same trade would produce inconsistent results and that is not in line with our goal. 

Our plan is to wait for better prices which means a retest of 575 would have to happen. If price continues higher, then we will be evaluating for the next swing trade long opportunity.

This is almost exactly the same post as my BTCUDSD post for the day.  An indicator that I like to use to help see through the noise is the Hull  MACD , which is a difficult indicator to use because they are not a lot of resources on it.  But generally a  bearish  cross is a  bearish  cross.  I highlighted in yellow what the H-MACD looks like when you are moving through a bubble and we certainly don't see that behavior.  In other words, this  bearish  cross will tend to bring the prices down. We may see this  bearish  cross on the H-MACD cause some convergence on the normal  MACD  leading to a  bearish  cross there, which I have highlighted a previous example in blue.    

Additionally the 1h chart has some  bearish  divergence setting in.   This peak is lower than the last and we had to get the  bearish  divergence to do this.  The overall sentiment has not been enough to give this upswing any real momentum.  This isn't quite enough for me to go short but I am thinking about it.

Something different. No indicators. Just looking at price action on different time frames and looking for areas of previous activity. 

There's a lot going on here at first glance but it's not that crazy when you dive in. I started by looking at the most recent price movement. Here is the 1 hour chart for eth starting in April. We get a 5 wave structure up with the horizontal lines showing the top and the bottom of our current channel. We're looking for a corrective wave two that doesn't retrace 1 by more than 100 percent. If it does we look for a different count. 

So the current story becomes, is the 2 in? Here I have labeled a theory that says, yes, yes it is.  Doesn't mean it's true. 

Here's my thought process; the move down could be counted as a 12345 which would make it the A, then B bounces up to 550 or so, and then C corrects down below A meaning eth dips below 500 again. This would certainly still be a valid count but I started to look at areas with lots of price action recently and saw two channels. Our current channel in green and the previous channel in red. In blue are the time frames where the price shifted from one channel to the other. I suspect a third one to be coming soon. There's just so much price history in these areas that I think it's likely to return there. There are psychological and mathematical reasons for this but that discussion is for another time but I'll summarize by stating a true trope: Markets have memories. 

Is it possible that we break  bearish  out of the current channel? Most definitely. And it very well may. There are some funky waves to interpret and I'm sure different  Elliott  traders will see things differently.

The price is below the green ascending  trend line . The possible ways for  Ethereum -0.53%  are the following: 
1.	Red scenario ( bearish ). ETH/USD will move towards the closest  support area  at $596.08 and break through it targeting the next  support area  at $566.90. 
2.	Orange scenario (neutral).  Ethereum -0.53%  will stay within the current range, limited by the  support area  at $596.08 and the closest  resistance area  at $626.66 without significant price changes. 
3.	Green scenario ( bullish ). The currency pair will break through $626.66 targeting the next  resistance area  at $662.39, which coincides with the 1 retracement level.

Ethereum -0.54%  is trading right on a side-wards resistance structure at 606, and has been trading at this level since 3rd June. Price is trading upwards along a side-wards support line, which has now converged into the side-wards resistance line. Price is at a juncture, and price needs to either break upwards, and break downwards. 

Supporting the upside, there is a side-wards support line thats recently formed, if price stays above this line, it will mean price is forced to break the side-wards resistance at 612.  

If price breaks the support  trend line , then we can expect some downside. If price breaks the support  trend line , AND also hits the side-wards  resistance level , then it is a good sell opportunity.

What's up traders, I hope you're all having a good trading week so far. Let's get straight into it! 

Ethereum -0.52%  is trading right on a side-wards resistance structure at 606, and has been trading at this level since 3rd June. Price is trading upwards along a side-wards support line, which has now converged into the side-wards resistance line. Price is at a juncture, and price needs to either break upwards, and break downwards. 

Supporting the upside, there is a side-wards support line thats recently formed, if price stays above this line, it will mean price is forced to break the side-wards resistance at 612.  

If price breaks the support  trend line , then we can expect some downside. If price breaks the support  trend line , AND also hits the side-wards  resistance level , then it is a good sell opportunity. 

There is 2 outcomes for  Ethereum -0.52%  in the short term. They are: 

- If price goes below 597.65 and closes there, then I am expecting downside to continue to 497.40 (Where there is some localized structure which could act as support) or the lower horizontal  support zone  at 364.00. 
- Price stays above 597.65 and breaks out of the side-wards resistance. If this happens, there will be a retest on the side-wards resistance line turned support and then break to the upside.

 ETHUSD -0.52%  update: The slow grind is a pleasant market to watch if you are managing positions over the long term. If you are trying to open a new position, it can be very hard to watch because it can turn at any point, but slowly continues higher. What is not obvious is the risk of retrace which I will talk more about in this report. 

Price is about to retest the 625 resistance (.382 of recent  bearish  swing). This level has previously proven to attract selling activity. The question is do these bears return? The higher low established at 575 indicates that price is more likely to push higher, but this is where the risk of retrace comes into play. 

The 641 reversal zone boundary is relative to the 628 high and is the area to watch for  bearish  formations IF a fake out is in order for these markets.  

Keep in mind, this is not a prediction, it is a scenario to be prepared for. If the newly established  bullish trend line  stays intact, this market may be on its way to a new high and a decisive close above the 628 level. This will change the short term outlook from  bearish  to  bullish .  

At S.C., we are not taking any new swing trade longs because price is too close to resistance levels. We would rather miss the low probability trade, even if it works out this time. We know that in the long run, the same trade would produce inconsistent results and that is not in line with our goal.

But generally a  bearish  cross is a  bearish  cross.  I highlighted in yellow what the H-MACD looks like when you are moving through a bubble and we certainly don't see that behavior.  In other words, this  bearish  cross will tend to bring the prices down.

Additionally the 1h chart has some  bearish  divergence setting in.   This peak is lower than the last and we had to get the  bearish  divergence to do this.

Something different. No indicators. Just looking at price action on different time frames and looking for areas of previous activity. 

There's a lot going on here at first glance but it's not that crazy when you dive in. I started by looking at the most recent price movement. Here is the 1 hour chart for eth starting in April. We get a 5 wave structure up with the horizontal lines showing the top and the bottom of our current channel. We're looking for a corrective wave two that doesn't retrace 1 by more than 100 percent. If it does we look for a different count. 

So the current story becomes, is the 2 in? Here I have labeled a theory that says, yes, yes it is.  Doesn't mean it's true. 

Here's my thought process; the move down could be counted as a 12345 which would make it the A, then B bounces up to 550 or so, and then C corrects down below A meaning eth dips below 500 again. This would certainly still be a valid count but I started to look at areas with lots of price action recently and saw two channels. Our current channel in green and the previous channel in red. In blue are the time frames where the price shifted from one channel to the other. I suspect a third one to be coming soon. There's just so much price history in these areas that I think it's likely to return there. There are psychological and mathematical reasons for this but that discussion is for another time but I'll summarize by stating a true trope: Markets have memories. 

Is it possible that we break  bearish  out of the current channel? Most definitely. And it very well may. There are some funky waves to interpret and I'm sure different  Elliott  traders will see things differently.

I suppose, the growth is delayed. Current structure still can be an impuls only after sweeping move above 630 on high volumes. 
But. More realistic would be a continuetion of a flat like I sketched out. Because volumes on top 3 cryptocurrencies are very low, it doesn't look like before the growth. Also alts made  zig-zag  correction from the lows of 28th of May. And even more alts made impulses downwards 4-5 of June. 
Still some small growth can be in this case, but without significant changes in the essence.

ETH/USD overview. Just take a look on chart, price is so close to key level $628 from which cryptocurrency rate bounced several times. That level is a key zone for big players. You can open short near $628 with goal $400.  

If price will move down, it could go to $400. But for us that would be the greatest opportunity to buy ETH for so low price.  

I need to explain you, why I think only for short, at this moment. As you know there is no news around cryptocurrency. We have silents. It's a signal that Big players accumulate their positions. They do it in a Range moves. They wait till retail traders will get tired to wait, and sell all their positions for a low price. There could be a big moving after huge range. I see that pattern on every marker on Stock, FX and Crypto too.

My proposed wave in red may be far too conservative in both time and price movement estimations. 

Markets mirror previous actions. Cycles repeat with variation. Repetition and variation create rhythm. Habits are the rhythms of human life. Markets are reflections of humans. Charts are markers along the path.

ETH/USD overview. Just take a look on chart, price is so close to key level $628 from which cryptocurrency rate bounced several times. That level is a key zone for big players. You can open short near $628 with goal $400.  

If price will move down, it could go to $400. But for us that would be the greatest opportunity to buy ETH for so low price.  

I need to explain you, why I think only for short, at this moment. As you know there is no news around cryptocurrency. We have silents. It's a signal that Big players accumulate their positions. They do it in a Range moves. They wait till retail traders will get tired to wait, and sell all their positions for a low price. There could be a big moving after huge range.

Ethereum -0.64%  is trading right on a side-wards resistance structure at 606, and has been trading at this level since 3rd June. Price is trading upwards along a side-wards support line, which has now converged into the side-wards resistance line. Price is at a juncture, and price needs to either break upwards, and break downwards. 

Supporting the upside, there is a side-wards support line thats recently formed, if price stays above this line, it will mean price is forced to break the side-wards resistance at 612.  

If price breaks the support  trend line , then we can expect some downside. If price breaks the support  trend line , AND also hits the side-wards  resistance level , then it is a good sell opportunity. 

There is 2 outcomes for  Ethereum -0.64%  in the short term. They are: 

- If price goes below 597.65 and closes there, then I am expecting downside to continue to 497.40 (Where there is some localized structure which could act as support) or the lower horizontal  support zone  at 364.00. 
- Price stays above 597.65 and breaks out of the side-wards resistance. If this happens, there will be a retest on the side-wards resistance line turned support and then break to the upside.

Something different. No indicators. Just looking at price action on different time frames and looking for areas of previous activity. 

There's a lot going on here at first glance but it's not that crazy when you dive in. I started by looking at the most recent price movement. Here is the 1 hour chart for eth starting in April. We get a 5 wave structure up with the horizontal lines showing the top and the bottom of our current channel. We're looking for a corrective wave two that doesn't retrace 1 by more than 100 percent. If it does we look for a different count. 

So the current story becomes, is the 2 in? Here I have labeled a theory that says, yes, yes it is.  Doesn't mean it's true. 

Here's my thought process; the move down could be counted as a 12345 which would make it the A, then B bounces up to 550 or so, and then C corrects down below A meaning eth dips below 500 again. This would certainly still be a valid count but I started to look at areas with lots of price action recently and saw two channels. Our current channel in green and the previous channel in red. In blue are the time frames where the price shifted from one channel to the other. I suspect a third one to be coming soon. There's just so much price history in these areas that I think it's likely to return there. There are psychological and mathematical reasons for this but that discussion is for another time but I'll summarize by stating a true trope: Markets have memories. 

Is it possible that we break  bearish  out of the current channel? Most definitely. And it very well may. There are some funky waves to interpret and I'm sure different  Elliott  traders will see things differently. 

I'm looking from different perspectives to try to carve out the narrative.

A combined  hammer  formed on the 28th and 29th of last month (when combining the two candles, a strong  hammer  forms) ended the recent sell off for now. 

Now market is against a better  resistance zone  between 625 and 635; not only the 38,2%  Fibonacci retracement  level but also previous horizontal support from earlier this in may (see up arrows). Against this resistance, a combined  shooting star  has formed. The fact that market is keeping steady after this may imply upside is not done for now and market is just consolidating recent gains. But this has to be confirmed with a better move over 635. 

As long as dips hold toward 575 support one may expect such a move; 700 is implied after this.

So the current story becomes, is the 2 in? Here I have labeled a theory that says, yes, yes it is.  Doesn't mean it's true. 

Here's my thought process; the move down could be counted as a 12345 which would make it the A, then B bounces up to 550 or so, and then C corrects down below A meaning eth dips below 500 again. This would certainly still be a valid count but I started to look at areas with lots of price action recently and saw two channels. Our current channel in green and the previous channel in red. In blue are the time frames where the price shifted from one channel to the other. I suspect a third one to be coming soon. There's just so much price history in these areas that I think it's likely to return there. There are psychological and mathematical reasons for this but that discussion is for another time but I'll summarize by stating a true trope: Markets have memories. 

Is it possible that we break  bearish  out of the current channel? Most definitely. And it very well may. There are some funky waves to interpret and I'm sure different  Elliott  traders will see things differently.

What's up traders, I hope you're all having a good trading week so far. Let's get straight into it! 

Ethereum -0.80%  is trading right on a side-wards resistance structure at 606, and has been trading at this level since 3rd June. Price is trading upwards along a side-wards support line, which has now converged into the side-wards resistance line. Price is at a juncture, and price needs to either break upwards, and break downwards. 

Supporting the upside, there is a side-wards support line thats recently formed, if price stays above this line, it will mean price is forced to break the side-wards resistance at 612.  

If price breaks the support  trend line , then we can expect some downside. If price breaks the support  trend line , AND also hits the side-wards  resistance level , then it is a good sell opportunity. 

There is 2 outcomes for  Ethereum -0.80%  in the short term. They are: 

- If price goes below 597.65 and closes there, then I am expecting downside to continue to 497.40 (Where there is some localized structure which could act as support) or the lower horizontal  support zone  at 364.00. 
- Price stays above 597.65 and breaks out of the side-wards resistance. If this happens, there will be a retest on the side-wards resistance line turned support and then break to the upside.

 ETHUSD -0.80%  update: The slow grind is a pleasant market to watch if you are managing positions over the long term. If you are trying to open a new position, it can be very hard to watch because it can turn at any point, but slowly continues higher. What is not obvious is the risk of retrace which I will talk more about in this report. 

Price is about to retest the 625 resistance (.382 of recent  bearish  swing). This level has previously proven to attract selling activity. The question is do these bears return? The higher low established at 575 indicates that price is more likely to push higher, but this is where the risk of retrace comes into play. 

The 641 reversal zone boundary is relative to the 628 high and is the area to watch for  bearish  formations IF a fake out is in order for these markets.  

Keep in mind, this is not a prediction, it is a scenario to be prepared for. If the newly established  bullish trend line  stays intact, this market may be on its way to a new high and a decisive close above the 628 level. This will change the short term outlook from  bearish  to  bullish .

This is almost exactly the same post as my BTCUDSD post for the day.  An indicator that I like to use to help see through the noise is the Hull  MACD , which is a difficult indicator to use because they are not a lot of resources on it.  But generally a  bearish  cross is a  bearish  cross.  I highlighted in yellow what the H-MACD looks like when you are moving through a bubble and we certainly don't see that behavior.  In other words, this  bearish  cross will tend to bring the prices down. We may see this  bearish  cross on the H-MACD cause some convergence on the normal  MACD  leading to a  bearish  cross there, which I have highlighted a previous example in blue.    

Additionally the 1h chart has some  bearish  divergence setting in.   This peak is lower than the last and we had to get the  bearish  divergence to do this.  The overall sentiment has not been enough to give this upswing any real momentum.  This isn't quite enough for me to go short but I am thinking about it.  But both the micro and  daily charts  look poor enough that my optimism has turned to neutral (at the very best).

First had a downtrending channel, recently price broke out of this channel, but finds it hard to break clearly. 
Matching up a zone of resistance and an area that looks like a double shoulder head and shoulder pattern, price is more likely to go down and test the lows for a potential bottom in the market. 

Conclusion: View is neutral until it either breaks the 630 or 490 barrier. Shorter term views, a more negative outlook, maybe price will retest at 630 and then drop off.

Something different. No indicators. Just looking at price action on different time frames and looking for areas of previous activity. 

There's a lot going on here at first glance but it's not that crazy when you dive in. I started by looking at the most recent price movement. Here is the 1 hour chart for eth starting in April. We get a 5 wave structure up with the horizontal lines showing the top and the bottom of our current channel. We're looking for a corrective wave two that doesn't retrace 1 by more than 100 percent. If it does we look for a different count. 

So the current story becomes, is the 2 in? Here I have labeled a theory that says, yes, yes it is.  Doesn't mean it's true. 

Here's my thought process; the move down could be counted as a 12345 which would make it the A, then B bounces up to 550 or so, and then C corrects down below A meaning eth dips below 500 again. This would certainly still be a valid count but I started to look at areas with lots of price action recently and saw two channels. Our current channel in green and the previous channel in red. In blue are the time frames where the price shifted from one channel to the other. I suspect a third one to be coming soon. There's just so much price history in these areas that I think it's likely to return there. There are psychological and mathematical reasons for this but that discussion is for another time but I'll summarize by stating a true trope: Markets have memories. 

Is it possible that we break  bearish  out of the current channel? Most definitely. And it very well may. There are some funky waves to interpret and I'm sure different  Elliott  traders will see things differently.

This is almost exactly the same post as my BTCUDSD post for the day.  An indicator that I like to use to help see through the noise is the Hull  MACD , which is a difficult indicator to use because they are not a lot of resources on it.  But generally a  bearish  cross is a  bearish  cross.  I highlighted in yellow what the H-MACD looks like when you are moving through a bubble and we certainly don't see that behavior.  In other words, this  bearish  cross will tend to bring the prices down. We may see this  bearish  cross on the H-MACD cause some convergence on the normal  MACD  leading to a  bearish  cross there, which I have highlighted a previous example in blue.    

Additionally the 1h chart has some  bearish  divergence setting in.   This peak is lower than the last and we had to get the  bearish  divergence to do this.  The overall sentiment has not been enough to give this upswing any real momentum.  This isn't quite enough for me to go short but I am thinking about it.  But both the micro and  daily charts  look poor enough that my optimism has turned to neutral (at the very best).

First had a downtrending channel, recently price broke out of this channel, but finds it hard to break clearly. 
Matching up a zone of resistance and an area that looks like a double shoulder head and shoulder pattern, price is more likely to go down and test the lows for a potential bottom in the market. 

Conclusion: View is neutral until it either breaks the 630 or 490 barrier. Shorter term views, a more negative outlook, maybe price will retest at 630 and then drop off.

Something different. No indicators. Just looking at price action on different time frames and looking for areas of previous activity. 

There's a lot going on here at first glance but it's not that crazy when you dive in. I started by looking at the most recent price movement. Here is the 1 hour chart for eth starting in April. We get a 5 wave structure up with the horizontal lines showing the top and the bottom of our current channel. We're looking for a corrective wave two that doesn't retrace 1 by more than 100 percent. If it does we look for a different count. 

So the current story becomes, is the 2 in? Here I have labeled a theory that says, yes, yes it is.  Doesn't mean it's true. 

Here's my thought process; the move down could be counted as a 12345 which would make it the A, then B bounces up to 550 or so, and then C corrects down below A meaning eth dips below 500 again. This would certainly still be a valid count but I started to look at areas with lots of price action recently and saw two channels. Our current channel in green and the previous channel in red. In blue are the time frames where the price shifted from one channel to the other. I suspect a third one to be coming soon. There's just so much price history in these areas that I think it's likely to return there. There are psychological and mathematical reasons for this but that discussion is for another time but I'll summarize by stating a true trope: Markets have memories. 

Is it possible that we break  bearish  out of the current channel? Most definitely. And it very well may. There are some funky waves to interpret and I'm sure different  Elliott  traders will see things differently. 

I'm looking from different perspectives to try to carve out the narrative.

What's up traders, I hope you're all having a good trading week so far. Let's get straight into it! 

Ethereum -0.77%  is trading right on a side-wards resistance structure at 606, and has been trading at this level since 3rd June. Price is trading upwards along a side-wards support line, which has now converged into the side-wards resistance line. Price is at a juncture, and price needs to either break upwards, and break downwards. 

Supporting the upside, there is a side-wards support line thats recently formed, if price stays above this line, it will mean price is forced to break the side-wards resistance at 612.  

If price breaks the support  trend line , then we can expect some downside. If price breaks the support  trend line , AND also hits the side-wards  resistance level , then it is a good sell opportunity. 

There is 2 outcomes for  Ethereum -0.77%  in the short term. They are: 

- If price goes below 597.65 and closes there, then I am expecting downside to continue to 497.40 (Where there is some localized structure which could act as support) or the lower horizontal  support zone  at 364.00. 
- Price stays above 597.65 and breaks out of the side-wards resistance. If this happens, there will be a retest on the side-wards resistance line turned support and then break to the upside.

 ETHUSD -0.77%  update: The slow grind is a pleasant market to watch if you are managing positions over the long term. If you are trying to open a new position, it can be very hard to watch because it can turn at any point, but slowly continues higher. What is not obvious is the risk of retrace which I will talk more about in this report. 

Price is about to retest the 625 resistance (.382 of recent  bearish  swing). This level has previously proven to attract selling activity. The question is do these bears return? The higher low established at 575 indicates that price is more likely to push higher, but this is where the risk of retrace comes into play. 

The 641 reversal zone boundary is relative to the 628 high and is the area to watch for  bearish  formations IF a fake out is in order for these markets.  

Keep in mind, this is not a prediction, it is a scenario to be prepared for. If the newly established  bullish trend line  stays intact, this market may be on its way to a new high and a decisive close above the 628 level. This will change the short term outlook from  bearish  to  bullish .  

At S.C., we are not taking any new swing trade longs because price is too close to resistance levels. We would rather miss the low probability trade, even if it works out this time. We know that in the long run, the same trade would produce inconsistent results and that is not in line with our goal. 

Our plan is to wait for better prices which means a retest of 575 would have to happen. If price continues higher, then we will be evaluating for the next swing trade long opportunity.

Price is about to retest the 625 resistance (.382 of recent  bearish  swing). This level has previously proven to attract selling activity. The question is do these bears return? The higher low established at 575 indicates that price is more likely to push higher, but this is where the risk of retrace comes into play. 

The 641 reversal zone boundary is relative to the 628 high and is the area to watch for  bearish  formations IF a fake out is in order for these markets.  

Keep in mind, this is not a prediction, it is a scenario to be prepared for. If the newly established  bullish trend line  stays intact, this market may be on its way to a new high and a decisive close above the 628 level. This will change the short term outlook from  bearish  to  bullish .  

At S.C., we are not taking any new swing trade longs because price is too close to resistance levels. We would rather miss the low probability trade, even if it works out this time. We know that in the long run, the same trade would produce inconsistent results and that is not in line with our goal. 

Our plan is to wait for better prices which means a retest of 575 would have to happen. If price continues higher, then we will be evaluating for the next swing trade long opportunity.

This is almost exactly the same post as my BTCUDSD post for the day.  An indicator that I like to use to help see through the noise is the Hull  MACD , which is a difficult indicator to use because they are not a lot of resources on it.  But generally a  bearish  cross is a  bearish  cross.  I highlighted in yellow what the H-MACD looks like when you are moving through a bubble and we certainly don't see that behavior.  In other words, this  bearish  cross will tend to bring the prices down. We may see this  bearish  cross on the H-MACD cause some convergence on the normal  MACD  leading to a  bearish  cross there, which I have highlighted a previous example in blue.    

Additionally the 1h chart has some  bearish  divergence setting in.   This peak is lower than the last and we had to get the  bearish  divergence to do this.  The overall sentiment has not been enough to give this upswing any real momentum.  This isn't quite enough for me to go short but I am thinking about it.

First had a downtrending channel, recently price broke out of this channel, but finds it hard to break clearly. 
Matching up a zone of resistance and an area that looks like a double shoulder head and shoulder pattern, price is more likely to go down and test the lows for a potential bottom in the market.

Something different. No indicators. Just looking at price action on different time frames and looking for areas of previous activity. 

There's a lot going on here at first glance but it's not that crazy when you dive in. I started by looking at the most recent price movement. Here is the 1 hour chart for eth starting in April. We get a 5 wave structure up with the horizontal lines showing the top and the bottom of our current channel. We're looking for a corrective wave two that doesn't retrace 1 by more than 100 percent. If it does we look for a different count. 

So the current story becomes, is the 2 in? Here I have labeled a theory that says, yes, yes it is.  Doesn't mean it's true. 

Here's my thought process; the move down could be counted as a 12345 which would make it the A, then B bounces up to 550 or so, and then C corrects down below A meaning eth dips below 500 again. This would certainly still be a valid count but I started to look at areas with lots of price action recently and saw two channels. Our current channel in green and the previous channel in red. In blue are the time frames where the price shifted from one channel to the other. I suspect a third one to be coming soon. There's just so much price history in these areas that I think it's likely to return there. There are psychological and mathematical reasons for this but that discussion is for another time but I'll summarize by stating a true trope: Markets have memories. 

Is it possible that we break  bearish  out of the current channel? Most definitely. And it very well may. There are some funky waves to interpret and I'm sure different  Elliott  traders will see things differently.

The price is below the green ascending  trend line . The possible ways for  Ethereum -0.78%  are the following: 
1.	Red scenario ( bearish ). ETH/USD will move towards the closest  support area  at $596.08 and break through it targeting the next  support area  at $566.90. 
2.	Orange scenario (neutral).  Ethereum -0.78%  will stay within the current range, limited by the  support area  at $596.08 and the closest  resistance area  at $626.66 without significant price changes. 
3.	Green scenario ( bullish ). The currency pair will break through $626.66 targeting the next  resistance area  at $662.39, which coincides with the 1 retracement level.

What's up traders, I hope you're all having a good trading week so far. Let's get straight into it! 

Ethereum -0.78%  is trading right on a side-wards resistance structure at 606, and has been trading at this level since 3rd June. Price is trading upwards along a side-wards support line, which has now converged into the side-wards resistance line. Price is at a juncture, and price needs to either break upwards, and break downwards. 

Supporting the upside, there is a side-wards support line thats recently formed, if price stays above this line, it will mean price is forced to break the side-wards resistance at 612.  

If price breaks the support  trend line , then we can expect some downside. If price breaks the support  trend line , AND also hits the side-wards  resistance level , then it is a good sell opportunity. 

There is 2 outcomes for  Ethereum -0.78%  in the short term. They are: 

- If price goes below 597.65 and closes there, then I am expecting downside to continue to 497.40 (Where there is some localized structure which could act as support) or the lower horizontal  support zone  at 364.00. 
- Price stays above 597.65 and breaks out of the side-wards resistance. If this happens, there will be a retest on the side-wards resistance line turned support and then break to the upside. 

Please show your support and leave a like and follow - I'd really appreciate it! :-)

The price is below the green ascending  trend line . The possible ways for  Ethereum -0.69%  are the following: 
1.	Red scenario ( bearish ). ETH/USD will move towards the closest  support area  at $596.08 and break through it targeting the next  support area  at $566.90. 
2.	Orange scenario (neutral).  Ethereum -0.69%  will stay within the current range, limited by the  support area  at $596.08 and the closest  resistance area  at $626.66 without significant price changes. 
3.	Green scenario ( bullish ). The currency pair will break through $626.66 targeting the next  resistance area  at $662.39, which coincides with the 1 retracement level.

What's up traders, I hope you're all having a good trading week so far. Let's get straight into it! 

Ethereum -0.69%  is trading right on a side-wards resistance structure at 606, and has been trading at this level since 3rd June. Price is trading upwards along a side-wards support line, which has now converged into the side-wards resistance line. Price is at a juncture, and price needs to either break upwards, and break downwards. 

Supporting the upside, there is a side-wards support line thats recently formed, if price stays above this line, it will mean price is forced to break the side-wards resistance at 612.  

If price breaks the support  trend line , then we can expect some downside. If price breaks the support  trend line , AND also hits the side-wards  resistance level , then it is a good sell opportunity. 

There is 2 outcomes for  Ethereum -0.69%  in the short term. They are: 

- If price goes below 597.65 and closes there, then I am expecting downside to continue to 497.40 (Where there is some localized structure which could act as support) or the lower horizontal  support zone  at 364.00. 
- Price stays above 597.65 and breaks out of the side-wards resistance. If this happens, there will be a retest on the side-wards resistance line turned support and then break to the upside. 

Please show your support and leave a like and follow - I'd really appreciate it! :-)

 ETHUSD -0.69%  update: The slow grind is a pleasant market to watch if you are managing positions over the long term. If you are trying to open a new position, it can be very hard to watch because it can turn at any point, but slowly continues higher. What is not obvious is the risk of retrace which I will talk more about in this report. 

Price is about to retest the 625 resistance (.382 of recent  bearish  swing). This level has previously proven to attract selling activity. The question is do these bears return? The higher low established at 575 indicates that price is more likely to push higher, but this is where the risk of retrace comes into play. 

The 641 reversal zone boundary is relative to the 628 high and is the area to watch for  bearish  formations IF a fake out is in order for these markets.  

Keep in mind, this is not a prediction, it is a scenario to be prepared for. If the newly established  bullish trend line  stays intact, this market may be on its way to a new high and a decisive close above the 628 level. This will change the short term outlook from  bearish  to  bullish .  

At S.C., we are not taking any new swing trade longs because price is too close to resistance levels. We would rather miss the low probability trade, even if it works out this time. We know that in the long run, the same trade would produce inconsistent results and that is not in line with our goal. 

Our plan is to wait for better prices which means a retest of 575 would have to happen. If price continues higher, then we will be evaluating for the next swing trade long opportunity.

This is almost exactly the same post as my BTCUDSD post for the day.  An indicator that I like to use to help see through the noise is the Hull  MACD , which is a difficult indicator to use because they are not a lot of resources on it.  But generally a  bearish  cross is a  bearish  cross.  I highlighted in yellow what the H-MACD looks like when you are moving through a bubble and we certainly don't see that behavior.  In other words, this  bearish  cross will tend to bring the prices down. We may see this  bearish  cross on the H-MACD cause some convergence on the normal  MACD  leading to a  bearish  cross there, which I have highlighted a previous example in blue.    

Additionally the 1h chart has some  bearish  divergence setting in.   This peak is lower than the last and we had to get the  bearish  divergence to do this.  The overall sentiment has not been enough to give this upswing any real momentum.  This isn't quite enough for me to go short but I am thinking about it.

Something different. No indicators. Just looking at price action on different time frames and looking for areas of previous activity. 

There's a lot going on here at first glance but it's not that crazy when you dive in. I started by looking at the most recent price movement. Here is the 1 hour chart for eth starting in April. We get a 5 wave structure up with the horizontal lines showing the top and the bottom of our current channel. We're looking for a corrective wave two that doesn't retrace 1 by more than 100 percent. If it does we look for a different count. 

So the current story becomes, is the 2 in? Here I have labeled a theory that says, yes, yes it is.  Doesn't mean it's true. 

Here's my thought process; the move down could be counted as a 12345 which would make it the A, then B bounces up to 550 or so, and then C corrects down below A meaning eth dips below 500 again. This would certainly still be a valid count but I started to look at areas with lots of price action recently and saw two channels. Our current channel in green and the previous channel in red. In blue are the time frames where the price shifted from one channel to the other. I suspect a third one to be coming soon. There's just so much price history in these areas that I think it's likely to return there. There are psychological and mathematical reasons for this but that discussion is for another time but I'll summarize by stating a true trope: Markets have memories. 

Is it possible that we break  bearish  out of the current channel? Most definitely. And it very well may. There are some funky waves to interpret and I'm sure different  Elliott  traders will see things differently.

What's up traders, I hope you're all having a good trading week so far. Let's get straight into it! 

Ethereum -0.81%  is trading right on a side-wards resistance structure at 606, and has been trading at this level since 3rd June. Price is trading upwards along a side-wards support line, which has now converged into the side-wards resistance line. Price is at a juncture, and price needs to either break upwards, and break downwards. 

Supporting the upside, there is a side-wards support line thats recently formed, if price stays above this line, it will mean price is forced to break the side-wards resistance at 612.  

If price breaks the support  trend line , then we can expect some downside. If price breaks the support  trend line , AND also hits the side-wards  resistance level , then it is a good sell opportunity. 

There is 2 outcomes for  Ethereum -0.81%  in the short term. They are: 

- If price goes below 597.65 and closes there, then I am expecting downside to continue to 497.40 (Where there is some localized structure which could act as support) or the lower horizontal  support zone  at 364.00. 
- Price stays above 597.65 and breaks out of the side-wards resistance. If this happens, there will be a retest on the side-wards resistance line turned support and then break to the upside.

 ETHUSD -0.81%  update: The slow grind is a pleasant market to watch if you are managing positions over the long term. If you are trying to open a new position, it can be very hard to watch because it can turn at any point, but slowly continues higher. What is not obvious is the risk of retrace which I will talk more about in this report. 

Price is about to retest the 625 resistance (.382 of recent  bearish  swing). This level has previously proven to attract selling activity. The question is do these bears return? The higher low established at 575 indicates that price is more likely to push higher, but this is where the risk of retrace comes into play. 

The 641 reversal zone boundary is relative to the 628 high and is the area to watch for  bearish  formations IF a fake out is in order for these markets.  

Keep in mind, this is not a prediction, it is a scenario to be prepared for. If the newly established  bullish trend line  stays intact, this market may be on its way to a new high and a decisive close above the 628 level. This will change the short term outlook from  bearish  to  bullish .  

At S.C., we are not taking any new swing trade longs because price is too close to resistance levels. We would rather miss the low probability trade, even if it works out this time. We know that in the long run, the same trade would produce inconsistent results and that is not in line with our goal.

Something different. No indicators. Just looking at price action on different time frames and looking for areas of previous activity. 

There's a lot going on here at first glance but it's not that crazy when you dive in. I started by looking at the most recent price movement. Here is the 1 hour chart for eth starting in April. We get a 5 wave structure up with the horizontal lines showing the top and the bottom of our current channel. We're looking for a corrective wave two that doesn't retrace 1 by more than 100 percent. If it does we look for a different count. 

So the current story becomes, is the 2 in? Here I have labeled a theory that says, yes, yes it is.  Doesn't mean it's true. 

Here's my thought process; the move down could be counted as a 12345 which would make it the A, then B bounces up to 550 or so, and then C corrects down below A meaning eth dips below 500 again. This would certainly still be a valid count but I started to look at areas with lots of price action recently and saw two channels. Our current channel in green and the previous channel in red. In blue are the time frames where the price shifted from one channel to the other. I suspect a third one to be coming soon. There's just so much price history in these areas that I think it's likely to return there. There are psychological and mathematical reasons for this but that discussion is for another time but I'll summarize by stating a true trope: Markets have memories. 

Is it possible that we break  bearish  out of the current channel? Most definitely. And it very well may. There are some funky waves to interpret and I'm sure different  Elliott  traders will see things differently.

A combined  hammer  formed on the 28th and 29th of last month (when combining the two candles, a strong  hammer  forms) ended the recent sell off for now. 

Now market is against a better  resistance zone  between 625 and 635; not only the 38,2%  Fibonacci retracement  level but also previous horizontal support from earlier this in may (see up arrows). Against this resistance, a combined  shooting star  has formed. The fact that market is keeping steady after this may imply upside is not done for now and market is just consolidating recent gains. But this has to be confirmed with a better move over 635.

I suppose, the growth is delayed. Current structure still can be an impuls only after sweeping move above 630 on high volumes. 
But. More realistic would be a continuetion of a flat like I sketched out. Because volumes on top 3 cryptocurrencies are very low, it doesn't look like before the growth. Also alts made  zig-zag  correction from the lows of 28th of May. And even more alts made impulses downwards 4-5 of June. 
Still some small growth can be in this case, but without significant changes in the essence.

ETH/USD overview. Just take a look on chart, price is so close to key level $628 from which cryptocurrency rate bounced several times. That level is a key zone for big players. You can open short near $628 with goal $400.  

If price will move down, it could go to $400. But for us that would be the greatest opportunity to buy ETH for so low price.  

I need to explain you, why I think only for short, at this moment. As you know there is no news around cryptocurrency. We have silents. It's a signal that Big players accumulate their positions. They do it in a Range moves. They wait till retail traders will get tired to wait, and sell all their positions for a low price. There could be a big moving after huge range. I see that pattern on every marker on Stock, FX and Crypto too.

I suppose, the growth is delayed. Current structure still can be an impuls only after sweeping move above 630 on high volumes. 
But. More realistic would be a continuetion of a flat like I sketched out. Because volumes on top 3 cryptocurrencies are very low, it doesn't look like before the growth. Also alts made  zig-zag  correction from the lows of 28th of May. And even more alts made impulses downwards 4-5 of June.

ETH/USD overview. Just take a look on chart, price is so close to key level $628 from which cryptocurrency rate bounced several times. That level is a key zone for big players. You can open short near $628 with goal $400.  

If price will move down, it could go to $400. But for us that would be the greatest opportunity to buy ETH for so low price.  

I need to explain you, why I think only for short, at this moment. As you know there is no news around cryptocurrency. We have silents. It's a signal that Big players accumulate their positions. They do it in a Range moves. They wait till retail traders will get tired to wait, and sell all their positions for a low price. There could be a big moving after huge range.

990,1528367699.0,TomProTrader,ETH/USD - Live Update,"
What's up traders, I hope you're all having a good trading week so far. Let's get straight into it! 

Ethereum -0.81%  is trading right on a side-wards resistance structure at 606, and has been trading at this level since 3rd June. Price is trading upwards along a side-wards support line, which has now converged into the side-wards resistance line. Price is at a juncture, and price needs to either break upwards, and break downwards. 

Supporting the upside, there is a side-wards support line thats recently formed, if price stays above this line, it will mean price is forced to break the side-wards resistance at 612.  

If price breaks the support  trend line , then we can expect some downside. If price breaks the support  trend line , AND also hits the side-wards  resistance level , then it is a good sell opportunity. 

There is 2 outcomes for  Ethereum -0.81%  in the short term. They are: 

- If price goes below 597.65 and closes there, then I am expecting downside to continue to 497.40 (Where there is some localized structure which could act as support) or the lower horizontal  support zone  at 364.00. 
- Price stays above 597.65 and breaks out of the side-wards resistance. If this happens, there will be a retest on the side-wards resistance line turned support and then break to the upside. 

Please show your support and leave a like and follow - I'd really appreciate it! :-)

991,1528343739.0,MarcPMarkets,ETHUSD: Poised To Break Higher But 641 Points To Vulnerability.,"
 ETHUSD -0.81%  update: The slow grind is a pleasant market to watch if you are managing positions over the long term. If you are trying to open a new position, it can be very hard to watch because it can turn at any point, but slowly continues higher. What is not obvious is the risk of retrace which I will talk more about in this report. 

Price is about to retest the 625 resistance (.382 of recent  bearish  swing). This level has previously proven to attract selling activity. The question is do these bears return? The higher low established at 575 indicates that price is more likely to push higher, but this is where the risk of retrace comes into play. 

The 641 reversal zone boundary is relative to the 628 high and is the area to watch for  bearish  formations IF a fake out is in order for these markets.  

Keep in mind, this is not a prediction, it is a scenario to be prepared for. If the newly established  bullish trend line  stays intact, this market may be on its way to a new high and a decisive close above the 628 level. This will change the short term outlook from  bearish  to  bullish .  

At S.C., we are not taking any new swing trade longs because price is too close to resistance levels. We would rather miss the low probability trade, even if it works out this time. We know that in the long run, the same trade would produce inconsistent results and that is not in line with our goal. 

Our plan is to wait for better prices which means a retest of 575 would have to happen. If price continues higher, then we will be evaluating for the next swing trade long opportunity.

This is almost exactly the same post as my BTCUDSD post for the day.  An indicator that I like to use to help see through the noise is the Hull  MACD , which is a difficult indicator to use because they are not a lot of resources on it.  But generally a  bearish  cross is a  bearish  cross.  I highlighted in yellow what the H-MACD looks like when you are moving through a bubble and we certainly don't see that behavior.  In other words, this  bearish  cross will tend to bring the prices down. We may see this  bearish  cross on the H-MACD cause some convergence on the normal  MACD  leading to a  bearish  cross there, which I have highlighted a previous example in blue.    

Additionally the 1h chart has some  bearish  divergence setting in.   This peak is lower than the last and we had to get the  bearish  divergence to do this.  The overall sentiment has not been enough to give this upswing any real momentum.  This isn't quite enough for me to go short but I am thinking about it.  But both the micro and  daily charts  look poor enough that my optimism has turned to neutral (at the very best).

First had a downtrending channel, recently price broke out of this channel, but finds it hard to break clearly. 
Matching up a zone of resistance and an area that looks like a double shoulder head and shoulder pattern, price is more likely to go down and test the lows for a potential bottom in the market. 

Conclusion: View is neutral until it either breaks the 630 or 490 barrier. Shorter term views, a more negative outlook, maybe price will retest at 630 and then drop off.

Something different. No indicators. Just looking at price action on different time frames and looking for areas of previous activity. 

There's a lot going on here at first glance but it's not that crazy when you dive in. I started by looking at the most recent price movement. Here is the 1 hour chart for eth starting in April. We get a 5 wave structure up with the horizontal lines showing the top and the bottom of our current channel. We're looking for a corrective wave two that doesn't retrace 1 by more than 100 percent. If it does we look for a different count. 

So the current story becomes, is the 2 in? Here I have labeled a theory that says, yes, yes it is.  Doesn't mean it's true. 

Here's my thought process; the move down could be counted as a 12345 which would make it the A, then B bounces up to 550 or so, and then C corrects down below A meaning eth dips below 500 again. This would certainly still be a valid count but I started to look at areas with lots of price action recently and saw two channels. Our current channel in green and the previous channel in red. In blue are the time frames where the price shifted from one channel to the other. I suspect a third one to be coming soon. There's just so much price history in these areas that I think it's likely to return there. There are psychological and mathematical reasons for this but that discussion is for another time but I'll summarize by stating a true trope: Markets have memories. 

Is it possible that we break  bearish  out of the current channel? Most definitely. And it very well may. There are some funky waves to interpret and I'm sure different  Elliott  traders will see things differently. 

I'm looking from different perspectives to try to carve out the narrative.
