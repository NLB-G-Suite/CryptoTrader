My best idea ever, taking some time off the last 2 days :) The whales just continue to play their little games by squeezing leveraged short and long positions out of the market. Can't play them, it's just too easy. Maybe it's time we retail traders stand together, combine our  volume  and use their own game against them. Yeah, maybe we could even make a blockbuster movie about this :) I love me some science fiction :) LOL  

My last update of the previous analysis i showed 2 important support levels where the price could bounce up from. The first support around 7350 did the trick and the price got pushed back to 7700. From that point on i told my members that i thought i was seeing distribution, but it was still very confusing to figure out what was going on. TA was showing  bullish  signs, that  bull flag  was very strong and was even turning slowly up and was about to squeeze upwards. But of course out of no where the price got dumped, the move we saw a few hours ago. After that 200 point drop the price got pushed up again to 7700 like that dump was a glitch. If your a whale, why not push out leveraged traders and take your money while your accumulating or distributing. It's like a bonus, like the cherry on top :)  

Anyway, in this chart we can see allot of similarities of what is going on. As you know i have been saying i am still  bearish  for the medium term, but i just could not say what was going to happen on the short term. 2 days ago after we finally dropped out of that  wedge , i said we would have 2 options.  
- Break those 2 support levels from the last update of my previous chart (73xx and 71xx) 
- Make a higher low at those same support levels and make another move up above the high.  
 
As we can see in the chart, the  fractal  is not 100% identical so it's no guarantee that the 7700 high we just saw is the high already and that we start to move down. But based on this  fractal , i don't want to see the price get above the 7800/7900. This  fractal  confirms my  bearish  view as well. That's why TA is so great, you can turn any chart to fit your view :). 

Even without this  fractal , i just give it a very small chance that 7K price action is the fundament of a low to start another bull rally, i just highly doubt that. I want to see more  volume  to begin with and at least  double bottom  kind of formation. So the minimum i expect is a test of the 7100/6900in the coming week or 2. But the movement i have in mind for the med term is a drop below the 7K to form a big V shape low. If we get to see that, than i might even become  bullish  for the rest of the year :).  

As long as the price stays above the 73xx, we have to assume the bulls are still in control and we should see another wave up. So for me the 73xx is an important turning point.

Comment:
					At the moment it looks like bulls are trying to push higher, this bull flag/triangle is still very strong. So no sign of weakness yet! First small sign would be a drop below 7620/7600. Bulls need to break 7700

Comment:
					This is my bigger picture, think this bearish triangle is still 100% in play. I think if bulls can't break the 7800/7900 the bearish version is probably going to happen. Can't say HOW it will go, this blue line is just a guess. But a big V shape low would be the most bullish for the long term. I still think we are seeing distribution here. The only way this idea can be countered, is through a big increase of buying volume, if that doesn't happen, i think it's only a matter of time.

Comment:
					Lower time frame we can see a new upwards channel and maybe even a rising wedge. From the looks of it, it's slowly going down to test the support line again. Depending on what will happen there we can make a better prediction for the rest of the day.

					What a surprise, nothing has changed :) 

The price took a small dump but the volume was low so no real read on what the intent was. So we might see another move up, if we start to see a small pump that takes out the 7800, be aware of a fake breakout. The blue line is a possibility of what the move could look like IF we move up and if the breakout fails. If that happens than we will probably get confirmation if the price breaks the 7600ish. If we break the 7800 it should stay above the 7700 to confirm another move up. Not much more to say about what's going on.

1,1528359434.0,Taiwan_Bear,2618 (Double top & 0.618 pull-back) - do not miss it!!,"
In the last couple of TAs I have mentioned the “2618 pattern” and have been asked what 2618 means. Sorry for taking it so long as it took me quite a while to put everything altogether. But, as promised, I have explained below the rules and trade setups for the 2618 pattern.  

What are the rules/setups/steps for 2618?  
1.	Form a  double top  (Note #1)  
2.	Neckline has to be broken  
3.	After price found support at point (b), wait for pull back to 0.618 fib retracement of (a)(b)  
4.	After price retraced to 0.618, look for confluence and sell (eg. Structures,  trendlines  ,  double top  on a lower time frame,  rsi  divergence,  bearish pin bar  ,  inside bar  break down etc.) (Note #2)  
5.	Stop loss to be set above  double top 
6.	Set Take Profit levels (Note #3)  

Note #1 ( Double top ):  
The first step for the formation of 2618 is to form a  double top  at key resistance levels. Why at key resistance levels? Because we want to avoid fake double tops which can occur occasionally.  

There are some variations between various resources (books, websites) regarding the definitions of “double top”. The main differences occur where:  
a)	Some said for a  double top  to be valid, the wick of the 2nd top cannot exceed the wick of the 1st top; whereas, others said:  
b)	The wick of the 2nd top can exceed the wick of the 1st top but the candle close of the 2nd top CANNOT exceed the wick of the 1st top; or  
c)	The wick of the 2nd top can exceed the wick of the 1st top and the candle close of the 2nd top CAN exceed the wick of the 1st top; or  
d)	The wick of the 2nd top meets at least the candle close of the 1st top; or  
e)	The body of the 2nd top cannot exceed the body of the 1st top  

Personally, I would say all the above definitions work just fine although I do prefer definition a) because it means that the selling pressure is strong and the bulls fail to make a higher high. When there is a higher high formed in a downtrend, it can mean the downtrend has reversed and therefore you might not want to sell when the price pulls back to the 0.618 fib retracement.  

Note #2 ( 0.618 retracement ):  
When the price pulls back to 0.618, it does not mean to sell straight away. There must be more than one reason to sell other than the 0.618 retrace. The more reasons the better. In this example, you can see there are certainly structures (key resistance levels) at the 0.618 retrace. As well, there was a  double top  formed on the lower time frame. Consequently, you can sell.  

After  BTC -0.83%  hit the 0.618 retrace the first time, the price dropped from $9735 to $8650. but quickly bounced back to the 0.618 retrace level. That was a second & better opportunity to sell. Not only did  BTC -0.83%  form a  double top  on the larger time frame, but also with a  bearish  divergence on the 4hr time frame. Accordingly, you have more reasons to sell.  

Note #3 (Set take profit)  
Same as the rules of “Double top”, there are some variations as to which price level should you take profits. Personally, I would stick to the below:  
1)	First, take profit when risk/reward ratio hits 1:1 (recommend to take 30% - 50% profits and adjust the SL of the remaining positions to break-even)  
2)	When price hits the same price level as the low after the neckline is broken ((b) point in this example)  
3)	When price hits 1.272 fib extension of (a)(b)  
4)	When price hits point (d) (using  AB=CD  pattern. If you are not sure what the rules of  AB=CD  are, you can refer to my previous TA in which I have attached the link below)  
5)	If in a one-way market (heavily bearish/bullish), you can always keep 10% to 20% of your positions and take profits when risk/reward ratio hits 1:5 or even 1:10

 BTC -0.83%  is on the verge of breaking to a daily higher high on the bounce if the bulls can see a push this morning. 
If we reject from here the daily will form a lower high and we will see a tightening pattern within the highlighted  support and resistance  lines.  
Important for the bulls to show up or we could stay in this range into tomorrow.  
Healthy consolidation after the most recent bull move and the 15 min chart needs to change the trend.  
Also look to  EMA  12 support on the 4 hour and hourly.  
Another morning like yesterday with the bulls comfortable as worst case, we likely stay in the tightening pattern if bulls cannot prove themselves.

The current situation of  Bitcoin -0.83%  is quite difficult. We are on a clear treshold. A lot of traders are saying that we are on a clear downtrend, but the same amount of people are claiming that we will have our reversal soon. 

This article tries to sum up all important information you have to need! 

1: Retracement of a parabolic uptrend: 
There is a rule of thumb for the retracement of a parabolic uptrend. We should retrace to approx. the 0.786  Fibonacci Retracement  +/- 10%! 
Depending where we start the count, we are already in that target. Although both ways (blue and red) have still some space for a further downwave! 







2: The bloody support of Bitcoin: 
The average cost of mining one  bitcoin -0.83%  are at USA/Russia approx. 4700$ and at 3100$ for china! 
A drop below a target of 4700$ would be savage. Nevertheless, i can't image that we will hit that target. 







3: Manipulation of  Bitcoin -0.83%  and the Bart Simpson Pattern: 
A friend of mine found some unusual patterns in the orderbooks of several exchanges: 
https://twitter.com/CryptoSyndrome 
Altcoins are manipulated on a daily basis. It seems that  bitcoin -0.83%  is now affected to this too, which causes all these 3-5% pump and dumps. 
Thus, we are forming all the time the Bartin Simpsons Patterns. 

4: Similarity to 2014: 
Bitcoin -0.83%  now: 






Bitcoin -0.83%  2014: 







5: Deminishing downtrend and a strong support 
If we see the falling  wedges  as the force of the downtrend, then the force is diminishing! 
Furthermore we have strong support which is holding now for the 4th time! 







6: The Indicators 
Having a look at the indicators at 2D, we have a good potential for an upwave now. 
The  volume  is deminishing which should indicate a breakout soon. 
The  MACD  is about to cross, the  RSI  was slightly overbought and is heading up like the  Stoch .  RSI . 
The 200  EMA  is slighty under the current price and act as a support. 

7: The symetrical Triangle 
The theory says, that we should have in a  sym -1.72% . triangle 5 times an  ABC  wave. The waves are not perfect, but we can construct them. 






As you can see, the last four ABC-Waves formed always a 1:1 extention, which indicates that we have finished wave 5. 

8: A possible Head and Shoulders 
Even if this is not the most perfect  Head and Shoulders  Pattern, it's still valid! 
We are currently at the neckline, which is a strong and important resistance. Breaking upwards should indicate a good uptrend. 







9: The magic  6th 0.00%  of the month 






Suprisingly we have on every  6th 0.00%  of the month a reversal. Why is that??? 
One reason could be the  CME Group Futures  with dates for the settlements always nearby the  6th 0.00%  of the month! 
http://www.cmegroup.com 

10: Longterm  Bullish  TA 
The whole pattern could be seen as a big  bullish pennant . 







11: Shortterm  Bullish  TA 
Leading diagonal  starting wave1 of an  Elliott Wave , since we have now an impulse wave, after the 5x  ABC  pattern inside the triangle is finished. 
Our target should be at the top of the triangle nearby 8600-8800$. 







12: Longterm  Bearish  TA 
We also can argue, that we are currenty in an downtrend and the  sym -1.72% . triangle just continuing the trend. 
Our target should be nearby 6000$ which is also a finished downwards  Elliott Wave .

Nothing is happening in the market:  volatility  has become extinct and coins' trading fallen out of fashion. Range-bound bots and robotic humans absolutely prosper in this environment. The price was unable to break the 7700 threshold. For me this is a  bearish  signal. Indicators provide mixed signals, so let's examine wave structure. The move from May 29 is a  3-wave -0.12%  correction within a larger downtrend. A price drop below 7500 would confirm this scenario.

					Impulse Wave Truncation (Truncated Fifth) - 
Truncated 5th wave is when the market has become so over-extended in Wave 3 that there is not much force left for the impulse wave to come to a proper completion. So when this happens, there is a chance that the last wave of the impulse, Wave 5, will not reach the end of Wave 3 before the market starts correcting in the opposite direction. At this point, the market is just too exhausted. This condition is often called a “failure” or a “Truncation.”

I can see many people still believe that we are going inside a  descending triangle . I also believed this in my idea that i shard on may 1st: 



 

Things can change so quickly and if we didn't adapt to the changes then someone will. That's why i believe that we have to be in fast adapt mode in this market. Doesn't mean that you need to change without checking yourself. I try to find 2-3 confirmations before i change my idea on something. This includes pattern changes, trend changes etc 

There are 21 corrective wave patterns in EW which is categorized into major 3 corrective wave patterns: 

Zigzag  (5-3-5) 
Flat (3-3-5) 
Triangle (3-3-3-3-3) 

And other patterns are combinations of the above which is:  

Double three (A combination of two corrective patterns above) 
Triple three (A combination of three corrective patterns above) 

So what i can see now is that we are in two double three combination corrective wave pattern: 








More info here:  

https://elliottwave-forecast.com/elliott-wave-theory/#corrective-waves 

Confirmations: 

1. Wave ((i)) of C is 1.6k and ((v)) is going to be completed below the triangle 
2. Wave (E) of the triangle can't go beyond the triangle.  
3. This has happened twice before in 2013 & 2015 

Each wave  got 3 subwaves (a,b &c) inside and we are in the subwave c of ((y)) of Y which is an impulsive wave. 

Impulsive waves: 1,3,5,a,c 
Corrective waves: 2,4,b 

Normal Fibo Ratios for these waves are: 

wave 2 = 0.5 - 0.8 of wave 1  
wave 3 = 1.236 - 1.618 of wave 1  
wave 4 = 0.5 - 0.618 of wave 3  
wave 5 = 0.618 - 1 of wave 1  
wave B = 0.5 - 0.8 of wave A  
wave C = 0.618 - 1.236 of wave A  

Now if you check what happened in subwave a of ((y)) of Y you can see that: 

Wave (i) of a: 985$ 
Wave (ii) of a: 434$  
Wave ( iii -0.57% ) of a: 1207$  
Wave (iv) of a: 691$ [~0.618 of Wave ( iii -0.57% )] 
Wave (v) of a: 950$  








I have seen  BTC -0.83%  impulsive waves fibo ratios almost the same as the previous impulsive wave fibo ratios. 
Now if you apply the same for the last wave C of (E) this is what you get: 

Wave ((i)) of c: 1587$ 
Wave ((ii)) of c  = 793$ 
Wave (( iii -0.57% )) of c  = 1961$ 
Wave ((iv)) of c [~0.618 of Wave (( iii -0.57% ))] = 1212$ 
Wave ((v)) of c  = 1587$ 








Also note that Wave ((iv)) might not retrace upto 0.618 of Wave (( iii -0.57% )) as everyone will be in panic mode by that time so minimum retracement would be around 0.386 of Wave (( iii -0.57% )) which is around 756$ and this is why i can see it goes down to 5k level or little bit more towards 4.7k which is the lowest level of the  support zone  (orange dotted lines) 








So 3 Possible Support lines for reversal would be 

1. Blue: 5800 - 6100 (Only possible if Wave ((v)) is truncated) 
2. Orange: 4700 - 5000 (This is most likely where we heading)  
3. Red: 4100 - 4400 (Only possible if Wave (( iii -0.57% )) is extended)

8,1528371476.0,fakhan,Bitcoin Completes Alternating Cycles On The Sixth Of  Month,"
 Bitcoin -0.83%  has recently developed an interesting pattern of completing a  bullish  and  bearish  cycle on the sixth of every month in an alternating order. As we can see in the chart above, a fall is followed by a rise. This has happened twice before and is expected to happen again now on the  6th 0.00%  of June, 2018. This time  Bitcoin -0.83%  will finish a  bearish  cycle and I expected to begin the next  bullish  cycle at least till the end of  6th 0.00%  of July, 2018. 

This pattern of rise and fall is also supported by other patterns on the chart that signal a  bullish  reversal. The support line has also held firmly and if this pattern of alternating rise and fall ensues,  Bitcoin -0.83%  could very well make new highs by the end of the year. The  RSI  is recovering from oversold levels and has now approached a normal.  Bitcoin -0.83%  is currently at a favorable point for  bullish  entries. The price broke a long term resistance as it break past the downtrend line in April, 2018. This was a big accomplishment for the bulls but the lack of confidence pulled the price back to the support line. Currently, the price is just above the support line and appears to be all set for a  bullish  comeback but the reality is, there are not enough bulls in the market. 

The past few months have been devastating for the price of  Bitcoin -0.83%  ( BTC -0.83% ) and a lot of investors are still running scared. Institutional investors are looking for more clarity regarding regulations concerning cryptocurrencies and also safer ways to invest and store their coins. As for retail investors, most of them comprise of first time investors who have never traded any financial asset before. So, when they saw that  Bitcoin -0.83%  ( BTC -0.83% ) is making 20% gains every day, they thought this could go on forever and jumped with both feet, only to find the carpet pulled under from their feet. Big investors have always played small investors as cannon fodder and have gotten away with their schemes even in regulated markets like forex or the stock market. Cryptocurrencies is a new market with no proper regulations which means it is natural to expect that those who can afford to not play by the rules, most likely won’t.

Hello friends,  

It's been a while since my last post; lack of time and an urge to do more research has mainly driven me to take a break from posting ideas on TradingView. I am still in the process of doing more research and study, but I figure posting once in a while couldn't hurt. 

Since I have become recently very convinced about this, I am outlining a very possible situation with  Bitcoin -0.83%  where the  trend line  we have been on since early October breaks, reaching around a temporary low of $5000. This is examined on the  daily chart , since this is one of the best charts to examine trends of this size. I have to first and foremost say that I am not trying to spread fear, I know many people do not like to hear  bearish  ideas, but  technical analysis  is ultimately a rational exercise, and I feel that possibilities with very strong signs should be explored. 

There are a few things to look at, but I first want to talk about the big picture with, long-term  support and resistance  lines. I think most people can agree that there was a very significant downtrending resistance line that began from the peak of the  ATH 0.63%  in late December, to the low of around $6400 (thick red line). After the break from that line, it seems we moved into a sideways trend, bouncing back and forth between an emerging downtrending resistance line (light red) and a support line that we seem to have been respecting since mid-October (light green); at least this appears to be the case with the lows, where the angle's effectiveness appears very strongly. Finally, based on previous bounces, we can establish a support of around $5000-$5300 (I've thus created a small  support zone  around that range, in dark green), as well as lower supports around $3200 and $2000 (though I do not believe these will be reached, in dark green).   

Now, onto the analysis - it's no secret that  Bitcoin -0.83%  has been squeezing in, ready for a significant move either upwards or downwards. Initially I considered the upwards move to be more likely due to the significant media attention cryptocurrency has been receiving, but after viewing previous market cycles of  Bitcoin -0.83%  (check 2013), it seems clear to me that the  bearish  scenario of closing in on the market cycle is very likely, and should at the very least be prepared for with proper risk management. According to Dow Theory, which is said to have laid the foundations of modern  technical analysis , history repeats itself, and this is a situation where we forced to consider this. 

Should we break from the line, we will likely fall straight down to the $5000-$5000 area, where we will shoot back up and bounce towards around $6700 or so (maybe a little less). From there one, we will likely enter a sideways trend, which we will continue until we see higher highs and higher lows and parabolic movement returns, which could lead to us challenging the all-time high, and hitting $35k-$50k. 

NOTE: I seem to have reached the max character limit for this section of the idea, so I will continue my text below.

Comment:
					Onto the short-term: 


Scenario A: 

The reason why I have drawn this movement into a pennant is this way, is simply because we have been moving through this ascending triangle for quite a while now (May 23rd to today). I don't think that the pattern will be sufficient to directly lead into a strong sell-off, but we should consider that the size of ascending triangle suggests a small movement downwards at the very least, which can create a higher low, and thus move into position into a bearish pennant. Why would a bearish pennant occur here and not have a bounce to $8500-$8700? The reason is in positioning - the huge downtrend (May 5th to May 26th) creates a very nice flagpole in which it hits around the $5000 area very perfectly, and thus I would not be surprised if this happens. 

Second reason: on the Stoch RSI indicator on the daily chart, it appears to be dangerously high, which would suggest it being oversold. For the most part, it seems to have called lows and highs, at least to some extent. This overdrawn movement may very well have increased the likelyhood of Bitcoin being oversold. This could suggest that this is the last step into a sharp downturn, but this does not preclude Situation B. Volume has also been steadily decreasing, but this is the case with any sort of consolidation, I believe. 

Finally, the lines I have drawn below the triangle are simply bounces that I think seem fairly reasonable. The length from to support to the lines correlate with the length of the flagpole, of course, though it may seem chopped off due to the huge line from the long-term support downwards. 


Scenario B: 

This is much simpler, Bitcoin hits the upper resistance line, bounces off, challenges the lower support line, and we potentially see a break, and the rest unfolds from there. 


----------------------------------------------------------------------- 


With all this being said, do not fear if you are hoping for more parabolic movement - this likely will not be the end, and will simply be the set up for a long, drawn out sideways movement until the first signs of bullish activity begin and we start all over again. If you are longing around here, please consider using risk management, prepare for every possibility. If you are shorting, the same applies. 

Please trade with care. I wish the best to all traders!

Comment:
					This really is a very minor note, but I just want to emphasize that the rising wedge (which I erroneously refer to as an ascending triangle, a bad habit I have) entering a bearish pennant is more based on intuition than anything. Also, this pennant is mainly based on the conservative assumption that the break will happen at 7900, if it happens at 7700 where we seem to be general resistance, the pennant would look something like this:

I am Mid term-bullish on  BTC -0.83%  going into the end of this week, but looking to get into the market on a pull back to occur before I get in to the market.  The jury is still out as to whether this weekly bear trend is ready to turn around.  

We can see that both the  RSI  and  MFI  are both  Bullish  on the daily having bottomed when reaching oversold on both at c. $7k support where we found our longer term  trend line . 

We are currently in the process of meeting the Tenkan (blue line) as I write this, so in the very short term, I am looking for a pull back to $7550 range for an entry.  One of the main reasons for this is that on the 4hour timeframes we are close to completing an edge to edge trade so the risk reward doesn’t fit my profile, however a break out from the cloud or above the Tenkan around $7777 will make me enter the market. 

The  RSI  and  MFI  have both been excellent indicators in this bear market.  Whenever  RSI  has gone above the 60 and the  MFI  80; its time to exit the market from a  bullish  trade and consider shorting as it progresses higher.   

Based on the  RSI ,  MFI  trends and the fact that we will run into the Kijun at just around $8-8.2k, I will be scalling out at this  bearish  confluence level to start looking for pull backs and reassessment as i believe it to be a key point as  

Best case scenario this trade would yield a 10% return before leverage. 
This is for illustrative purposes only, please DYOR and goodluck with your trading.

So the pullback trade that we were looking at worked out & has made it's way back to the neckline level of structure. We are now at what i like to call a ""decision point"" Essentially IF price is able to violate this current level od structure THEN we're likely to continue to our next price projection.  

Something that a lot of newer traders don't understand is that when it comes to bigger moves, the market will often provide multiple opportunities to get involved. For those who don't rush and for those who don't get discouraged. If you perform consistent analysis you can often find multiple ways to involve yourself in a trade even if you missed the first strike.

This is the way markets move, If you question my charting check my previous posts. Its as simple as pie. We are going down, How long and how far is too soon to say. Here is a chart that we can understand the future price action and where to buy back. Before you guys start blasting my comment section with the time and how it may not be right thats correct. I am not calculating the time I'm just making a technical drawing of the directions that we will see in the next few months.  

Recent price action has clear signs of wash trading / market manipulation fud and lots of nonsense. Its hard to prove almost impossible so as a trader we just need to deal with it. Ideally the situation you are supposed to trade are critical break up and break down points to enter the trade. Dont enter or exit dumb trades and lose money. As an experienced trader you should be looking for shorts, I would not consider a long unless we are over $10-12k

I am never good with words so instead of writing paragraphs of clarification to justify my call for SHORT since my last posting, I have explained everything on my chart with the least words possible using Fibonacci. It does not matter how popular  Bitcoin -0.84%  has become, or how deep it has disrupted the financial sector, or how many institutional investors have come to invest in it -- the psychology behind a market cycle does not change. 

I don't really encourage anyone to short  Bitcoin -0.84% , but in all honesty, don't expect the bulls to fly anytime soon. Like I said before, this correction that we are having right now is the ""MOTHER OF ALL CORRECTIONS"" after a 4-year-long bull cycle since the 2013 correction... and we are just halfway through.

My best idea ever, taking some time off the last 2 days :) The whales just continue to play their little games by squeezing leveraged short and long positions out of the market. Can't play them, it's just too easy. Maybe it's time we retail traders stand together, combine our  volume  and use their own game against them. Yeah, maybe we could even make a blockbuster movie about this :) I love me some science fiction :) LOL  

My last update of the previous analysis i showed 2 important support levels where the price could bounce up from. The first support around 7350 did the trick and the price got pushed back to 7700. From that point on i told my members that i thought i was seeing distribution, but it was still very confusing to figure out what was going on. TA was showing  bullish  signs, that  bull flag  was very strong and was even turning slowly up and was about to squeeze upwards. But of course out of no where the price got dumped, the move we saw a few hours ago. After that 200 point drop the price got pushed up again to 7700 like that dump was a glitch. If your a whale, why not push out leveraged traders and take your money while your accumulating or distributing. It's like a bonus, like the cherry on top :)  

Anyway, in this chart we can see allot of similarities of what is going on. As you know i have been saying i am still  bearish  for the medium term, but i just could not say what was going to happen on the short term. 2 days ago after we finally dropped out of that  wedge , i said we would have 2 options.  
- Break those 2 support levels from the last update of my previous chart (73xx and 71xx) 
- Make a higher low at those same support levels and make another move up above the high.  
 
As we can see in the chart, the  fractal  is not 100% identical so it's no guarantee that the 7700 high we just saw is the high already and that we start to move down. But based on this  fractal , i don't want to see the price get above the 7800/7900. This  fractal  confirms my  bearish  view as well. That's why TA is so great, you can turn any chart to fit your view :). 

Even without this  fractal , i just give it a very small chance that 7K price action is the fundament of a low to start another bull rally, i just highly doubt that. I want to see more  volume  to begin with and at least  double bottom  kind of formation. So the minimum i expect is a test of the 7100/6900in the coming week or 2. But the movement i have in mind for the med term is a drop below the 7K to form a big V shape low. If we get to see that, than i might even become  bullish  for the rest of the year :).  

As long as the price stays above the 73xx, we have to assume the bulls are still in control and we should see another wave up. So for me the 73xx is an important turning point.

Comment:
					This is my bigger picture, think this bearish triangle is still 100% in play. I think if bulls can't break the 7800/7900 the bearish version is probably going to happen. Can't say HOW it will go, this blue line is just a guess. But a big V shape low would be the most bullish for the long term. I still think we are seeing distribution here. The only way this idea can be countered, is through a big increase of buying volume, if that doesn't happen, i think it's only a matter of time.

The price took a small dump but the volume was low so no real read on what the intent was. So we might see another move up, if we start to see a small pump that takes out the 7800, be aware of a fake breakout. The blue line is a possibility of what the move could look like IF we move up and if the breakout fails. If that happens than we will probably get confirmation if the price breaks the 7600ish. If we break the 7800 it should stay above the 7700 to confirm another move up. Not much more to say about what's going on.

19,1528359434.0,Taiwan_Bear,2618 (Double top & 0.618 pull-back) - do not miss it!!,"
In the last couple of TAs I have mentioned the “2618 pattern” and have been asked what 2618 means. Sorry for taking it so long as it took me quite a while to put everything altogether. But, as promised, I have explained below the rules and trade setups for the 2618 pattern.  

What are the rules/setups/steps for 2618?  
1.	Form a  double top  (Note #1)  
2.	Neckline has to be broken  
3.	After price found support at point (b), wait for pull back to 0.618 fib retracement of (a)(b)  
4.	After price retraced to 0.618, look for confluence and sell (eg. Structures,  trendlines  ,  double top  on a lower time frame,  rsi  divergence,  bearish pin bar  ,  inside bar  break down etc.) (Note #2)  
5.	Stop loss to be set above  double top 
6.	Set Take Profit levels (Note #3)  

Note #1 ( Double top ):  
The first step for the formation of 2618 is to form a  double top  at key resistance levels. Why at key resistance levels? Because we want to avoid fake double tops which can occur occasionally.  

There are some variations between various resources (books, websites) regarding the definitions of “double top”. The main differences occur where:  
a)	Some said for a  double top  to be valid, the wick of the 2nd top cannot exceed the wick of the 1st top; whereas, others said:  
b)	The wick of the 2nd top can exceed the wick of the 1st top but the candle close of the 2nd top CANNOT exceed the wick of the 1st top; or  
c)	The wick of the 2nd top can exceed the wick of the 1st top and the candle close of the 2nd top CAN exceed the wick of the 1st top; or  
d)	The wick of the 2nd top meets at least the candle close of the 1st top; or  
e)	The body of the 2nd top cannot exceed the body of the 1st top  

Personally, I would say all the above definitions work just fine although I do prefer definition a) because it means that the selling pressure is strong and the bulls fail to make a higher high. When there is a higher high formed in a downtrend, it can mean the downtrend has reversed and therefore you might not want to sell when the price pulls back to the 0.618 fib retracement.  

Note #2 ( 0.618 retracement ):  
When the price pulls back to 0.618, it does not mean to sell straight away. There must be more than one reason to sell other than the 0.618 retrace. The more reasons the better. In this example, you can see there are certainly structures (key resistance levels) at the 0.618 retrace. As well, there was a  double top  formed on the lower time frame. Consequently, you can sell.  

After  BTC -0.83%  hit the 0.618 retrace the first time, the price dropped from $9735 to $8650. but quickly bounced back to the 0.618 retrace level. That was a second & better opportunity to sell. Not only did  BTC -0.83%  form a  double top  on the larger time frame, but also with a  bearish  divergence on the 4hr time frame. Accordingly, you have more reasons to sell.  

Note #3 (Set take profit)  
Same as the rules of “Double top”, there are some variations as to which price level should you take profits. Personally, I would stick to the below:  
1)	First, take profit when risk/reward ratio hits 1:1 (recommend to take 30% - 50% profits and adjust the SL of the remaining positions to break-even)  
2)	When price hits the same price level as the low after the neckline is broken ((b) point in this example)  
3)	When price hits 1.272 fib extension of (a)(b)  
4)	When price hits point (d) (using  AB=CD  pattern. If you are not sure what the rules of  AB=CD  are, you can refer to my previous TA in which I have attached the link below)  
5)	If in a one-way market (heavily bearish/bullish), you can always keep 10% to 20% of your positions and take profits when risk/reward ratio hits 1:5 or even 1:10

 BTC -0.84%  is on the verge of breaking to a daily higher high on the bounce if the bulls can see a push this morning. 
If we reject from here the daily will form a lower high and we will see a tightening pattern within the highlighted  support and resistance  lines.  
Important for the bulls to show up or we could stay in this range into tomorrow.  
Healthy consolidation after the most recent bull move and the 15 min chart needs to change the trend.  
Also look to  EMA  12 support on the 4 hour and hourly.  
Another morning like yesterday with the bulls comfortable as worst case, we likely stay in the tightening pattern if bulls cannot prove themselves.

The current situation of  Bitcoin -0.84%  is quite difficult. We are on a clear treshold. A lot of traders are saying that we are on a clear downtrend, but the same amount of people are claiming that we will have our reversal soon. 

This article tries to sum up all important information you have to need! 

1: Retracement of a parabolic uptrend: 
There is a rule of thumb for the retracement of a parabolic uptrend. We should retrace to approx. the 0.786  Fibonacci Retracement  +/- 10%! 
Depending where we start the count, we are already in that target. Although both ways (blue and red) have still some space for a further downwave! 







2: The bloody support of Bitcoin: 
The average cost of mining one  bitcoin -0.84%  are at USA/Russia approx. 4700$ and at 3100$ for china! 
A drop below a target of 4700$ would be savage. Nevertheless, i can't image that we will hit that target. 







3: Manipulation of  Bitcoin -0.84%  and the Bart Simpson Pattern: 
A friend of mine found some unusual patterns in the orderbooks of several exchanges: 
https://twitter.com/CryptoSyndrome 
Altcoins are manipulated on a daily basis. It seems that  bitcoin -0.84%  is now affected to this too, which causes all these 3-5% pump and dumps. 
Thus, we are forming all the time the Bartin Simpsons Patterns. 

4: Similarity to 2014: 
Bitcoin -0.84%  now: 






Bitcoin -0.84%  2014: 







5: Deminishing downtrend and a strong support 
If we see the falling  wedges  as the force of the downtrend, then the force is diminishing! 
Furthermore we have strong support which is holding now for the 4th time! 







6: The Indicators 
Having a look at the indicators at 2D, we have a good potential for an upwave now. 
The  volume  is deminishing which should indicate a breakout soon. 
The  MACD  is about to cross, the  RSI  was slightly overbought and is heading up like the  Stoch .  RSI . 
The 200  EMA  is slighty under the current price and act as a support. 

7: The symetrical Triangle 
The theory says, that we should have in a  sym -1.72% . triangle 5 times an  ABC  wave. The waves are not perfect, but we can construct them. 






As you can see, the last four ABC-Waves formed always a 1:1 extention, which indicates that we have finished wave 5. 

8: A possible Head and Shoulders 
Even if this is not the most perfect  Head and Shoulders  Pattern, it's still valid! 
We are currently at the neckline, which is a strong and important resistance. Breaking upwards should indicate a good uptrend. 







9: The magic  6th 0.00%  of the month 






Suprisingly we have on every  6th 0.00%  of the month a reversal. Why is that??? 
One reason could be the  CME Group Futures  with dates for the settlements always nearby the  6th 0.00%  of the month! 
http://www.cmegroup.com 

10: Longterm  Bullish  TA 
The whole pattern could be seen as a big  bullish pennant . 







11: Shortterm  Bullish  TA 
Leading diagonal  starting wave1 of an  Elliott Wave , since we have now an impulse wave, after the 5x  ABC  pattern inside the triangle is finished. 
Our target should be at the top of the triangle nearby 8600-8800$. 







12: Longterm  Bearish  TA 
We also can argue, that we are currenty in an downtrend and the  sym -1.72% . triangle just continuing the trend. 
Our target should be nearby 6000$ which is also a finished downwards  Elliott Wave .

Nothing is happening in the market:  volatility  has become extinct and coins' trading fallen out of fashion. Range-bound bots and robotic humans absolutely prosper in this environment. The price was unable to break the 7700 threshold. For me this is a  bearish  signal. Indicators provide mixed signals, so let's examine wave structure. The move from May 29 is a  3-wave -0.12%  correction within a larger downtrend. A price drop below 7500 would confirm this scenario.

					Impulse Wave Truncation (Truncated Fifth) - 
Truncated 5th wave is when the market has become so over-extended in Wave 3 that there is not much force left for the impulse wave to come to a proper completion. So when this happens, there is a chance that the last wave of the impulse, Wave 5, will not reach the end of Wave 3 before the market starts correcting in the opposite direction. At this point, the market is just too exhausted. This condition is often called a “failure” or a “Truncation.”

I can see many people still believe that we are going inside a  descending triangle . I also believed this in my idea that i shard on may 1st: 



 

Things can change so quickly and if we didn't adapt to the changes then someone will. That's why i believe that we have to be in fast adapt mode in this market. Doesn't mean that you need to change without checking yourself. I try to find 2-3 confirmations before i change my idea on something. This includes pattern changes, trend changes etc 

There are 21 corrective wave patterns in EW which is categorized into major 3 corrective wave patterns: 

Zigzag  (5-3-5) 
Flat (3-3-5) 
Triangle (3-3-3-3-3) 

And other patterns are combinations of the above which is:  

Double three (A combination of two corrective patterns above) 
Triple three (A combination of three corrective patterns above) 

So what i can see now is that we are in two double three combination corrective wave pattern:

Confirmations: 

1. Wave ((i)) of C is 1.6k and ((v)) is going to be completed below the triangle 
2. Wave (E) of the triangle can't go beyond the triangle.  
3. This has happened twice before in 2013 & 2015 

Each wave  got 3 subwaves (a,b &c) inside and we are in the subwave c of ((y)) of Y which is an impulsive wave. 

Impulsive waves: 1,3,5,a,c 
Corrective waves: 2,4,b 

Normal Fibo Ratios for these waves are: 

wave 2 = 0.5 - 0.8 of wave 1  
wave 3 = 1.236 - 1.618 of wave 1  
wave 4 = 0.5 - 0.618 of wave 3  
wave 5 = 0.618 - 1 of wave 1  
wave B = 0.5 - 0.8 of wave A  
wave C = 0.618 - 1.236 of wave A  

Now if you check what happened in subwave a of ((y)) of Y you can see that: 

Wave (i) of a: 985$ 
Wave (ii) of a: 434$  
Wave ( iii -0.59% ) of a: 1207$  
Wave (iv) of a: 691$ [~0.618 of Wave ( iii -0.59% )] 
Wave (v) of a: 950$  








I have seen  BTC -0.84%  impulsive waves fibo ratios almost the same as the previous impulsive wave fibo ratios. 
Now if you apply the same for the last wave C of (E) this is what you get: 

Wave ((i)) of c: 1587$ 
Wave ((ii)) of c  = 793$ 
Wave (( iii -0.59% )) of c  = 1961$ 
Wave ((iv)) of c [~0.618 of Wave (( iii -0.59% ))] = 1212$ 
Wave ((v)) of c  = 1587$ 








Also note that Wave ((iv)) might not retrace upto 0.618 of Wave (( iii -0.59% )) as everyone will be in panic mode by that time so minimum retracement would be around 0.386 of Wave (( iii -0.59% )) which is around 756$ and this is why i can see it goes down to 5k level or little bit more towards 4.7k which is the lowest level of the  support zone  (orange dotted lines) 








So 3 Possible Support lines for reversal would be 

1. Blue: 5800 - 6100 (Only possible if Wave ((v)) is truncated) 
2. Orange: 4700 - 5000 (This is most likely where we heading)  
3. Red: 4100 - 4400 (Only possible if Wave (( iii -0.59% )) is extended)

 Bitcoin -0.88%  has recently developed an interesting pattern of completing a  bullish  and  bearish  cycle on the sixth of every month in an alternating order. As we can see in the chart above, a fall is followed by a rise. This has happened twice before and is expected to happen again now on the  6th 0.00%  of June, 2018. This time  Bitcoin -0.88%  will finish a  bearish  cycle and I expected to begin the next  bullish  cycle at least till the end of  6th 0.00%  of July, 2018. 

This pattern of rise and fall is also supported by other patterns on the chart that signal a  bullish  reversal. The support line has also held firmly and if this pattern of alternating rise and fall ensues,  Bitcoin -0.88%  could very well make new highs by the end of the year. The  RSI  is recovering from oversold levels and has now approached a normal.  Bitcoin -0.88%  is currently at a favorable point for  bullish  entries. The price broke a long term resistance as it break past the downtrend line in April, 2018. This was a big accomplishment for the bulls but the lack of confidence pulled the price back to the support line. Currently, the price is just above the support line and appears to be all set for a  bullish  comeback but the reality is, there are not enough bulls in the market. 

The past few months have been devastating for the price of  Bitcoin -0.88%  ( BTC -0.88% ) and a lot of investors are still running scared. Institutional investors are looking for more clarity regarding regulations concerning cryptocurrencies and also safer ways to invest and store their coins. As for retail investors, most of them comprise of first time investors who have never traded any financial asset before. So, when they saw that  Bitcoin -0.88%  ( BTC -0.88% ) is making 20% gains every day, they thought this could go on forever and jumped with both feet, only to find the carpet pulled under from their feet. Big investors have always played small investors as cannon fodder and have gotten away with their schemes even in regulated markets like forex or the stock market. Cryptocurrencies is a new market with no proper regulations which means it is natural to expect that those who can afford to not play by the rules, most likely won’t.

Hello friends,  

It's been a while since my last post; lack of time and an urge to do more research has mainly driven me to take a break from posting ideas on TradingView. I am still in the process of doing more research and study, but I figure posting once in a while couldn't hurt. 

Since I have become recently very convinced about this, I am outlining a very possible situation with  Bitcoin -0.88%  where the  trend line  we have been on since early October breaks, reaching around a temporary low of $5000. This is examined on the  daily chart , since this is one of the best charts to examine trends of this size. I have to first and foremost say that I am not trying to spread fear, I know many people do not like to hear  bearish  ideas, but  technical analysis  is ultimately a rational exercise, and I feel that possibilities with very strong signs should be explored. 

There are a few things to look at, but I first want to talk about the big picture with, long-term  support and resistance  lines. I think most people can agree that there was a very significant downtrending resistance line that began from the peak of the  ATH 0.63%  in late December, to the low of around $6400 (thick red line). After the break from that line, it seems we moved into a sideways trend, bouncing back and forth between an emerging downtrending resistance line (light red) and a support line that we seem to have been respecting since mid-October (light green); at least this appears to be the case with the lows, where the angle's effectiveness appears very strongly. Finally, based on previous bounces, we can establish a support of around $5000-$5300 (I've thus created a small  support zone  around that range, in dark green), as well as lower supports around $3200 and $2000 (though I do not believe these will be reached, in dark green).   

Now, onto the analysis - it's no secret that  Bitcoin -0.88%  has been squeezing in, ready for a significant move either upwards or downwards. Initially I considered the upwards move to be more likely due to the significant media attention cryptocurrency has been receiving, but after viewing previous market cycles of  Bitcoin -0.88%  (check 2013), it seems clear to me that the  bearish  scenario of closing in on the market cycle is very likely, and should at the very least be prepared for with proper risk management. According to Dow Theory, which is said to have laid the foundations of modern  technical analysis , history repeats itself, and this is a situation where we forced to consider this. 

Should we break from the line, we will likely fall straight down to the $5000-$5000 area, where we will shoot back up and bounce towards around $6700 or so (maybe a little less). From there one, we will likely enter a sideways trend, which we will continue until we see higher highs and higher lows and parabolic movement returns, which could lead to us challenging the all-time high, and hitting $35k-$50k. 

NOTE: I seem to have reached the max character limit for this section of the idea, so I will continue my text below.

Comment:
					Onto the short-term: 


Scenario A: 

The reason why I have drawn this movement into a pennant is this way, is simply because we have been moving through this ascending triangle for quite a while now (May 23rd to today). I don't think that the pattern will be sufficient to directly lead into a strong sell-off, but we should consider that the size of ascending triangle suggests a small movement downwards at the very least, which can create a higher low, and thus move into position into a bearish pennant. Why would a bearish pennant occur here and not have a bounce to $8500-$8700? The reason is in positioning - the huge downtrend (May 5th to May 26th) creates a very nice flagpole in which it hits around the $5000 area very perfectly, and thus I would not be surprised if this happens. 

Second reason: on the Stoch RSI indicator on the daily chart, it appears to be dangerously high, which would suggest it being oversold. For the most part, it seems to have called lows and highs, at least to some extent. This overdrawn movement may very well have increased the likelyhood of Bitcoin being oversold. This could suggest that this is the last step into a sharp downturn, but this does not preclude Situation B. Volume has also been steadily decreasing, but this is the case with any sort of consolidation, I believe. 

Finally, the lines I have drawn below the triangle are simply bounces that I think seem fairly reasonable. The length from to support to the lines correlate with the length of the flagpole, of course, though it may seem chopped off due to the huge line from the long-term support downwards. 


Scenario B: 

This is much simpler, Bitcoin hits the upper resistance line, bounces off, challenges the lower support line, and we potentially see a break, and the rest unfolds from there. 


----------------------------------------------------------------------- 


With all this being said, do not fear if you are hoping for more parabolic movement - this likely will not be the end, and will simply be the set up for a long, drawn out sideways movement until the first signs of bullish activity begin and we start all over again. If you are longing around here, please consider using risk management, prepare for every possibility. If you are shorting, the same applies. 

Please trade with care. I wish the best to all traders!

Comment:
					This really is a very minor note, but I just want to emphasize that the rising wedge (which I erroneously refer to as an ascending triangle, a bad habit I have) entering a bearish pennant is more based on intuition than anything. Also, this pennant is mainly based on the conservative assumption that the break will happen at 7900, if it happens at 7700 where we seem to be general resistance, the pennant would look something like this:

I am Mid term-bullish on  BTC -0.88%  going into the end of this week, but looking to get into the market on a pull back to occur before I get in to the market.  The jury is still out as to whether this weekly bear trend is ready to turn around.  

We can see that both the  RSI  and  MFI  are both  Bullish  on the daily having bottomed when reaching oversold on both at c. $7k support where we found our longer term  trend line . 

We are currently in the process of meeting the Tenkan (blue line) as I write this, so in the very short term, I am looking for a pull back to $7550 range for an entry.  One of the main reasons for this is that on the 4hour timeframes we are close to completing an edge to edge trade so the risk reward doesn’t fit my profile, however a break out from the cloud or above the Tenkan around $7777 will make me enter the market. 

The  RSI  and  MFI  have both been excellent indicators in this bear market.  Whenever  RSI  has gone above the 60 and the  MFI  80; its time to exit the market from a  bullish  trade and consider shorting as it progresses higher.   

Based on the  RSI ,  MFI  trends and the fact that we will run into the Kijun at just around $8-8.2k, I will be scalling out at this  bearish  confluence level to start looking for pull backs and reassessment as i believe it to be a key point as  

Best case scenario this trade would yield a 10% return before leverage. 
This is for illustrative purposes only, please DYOR and goodluck with your trading.

So the pullback trade that we were looking at worked out & has made it's way back to the neckline level of structure. We are now at what i like to call a ""decision point"" Essentially IF price is able to violate this current level od structure THEN we're likely to continue to our next price projection.  

Something that a lot of newer traders don't understand is that when it comes to bigger moves, the market will often provide multiple opportunities to get involved. For those who don't rush and for those who don't get discouraged. If you perform consistent analysis you can often find multiple ways to involve yourself in a trade even if you missed the first strike.

Recent price action has clear signs of wash trading / market manipulation fud and lots of nonsense. Its hard to prove almost impossible so as a trader we just need to deal with it. Ideally the situation you are supposed to trade are critical break up and break down points to enter the trade. Dont enter or exit dumb trades and lose money.

I am never good with words so instead of writing paragraphs of clarification to justify my call for SHORT since my last posting, I have explained everything on my chart with the least words possible using Fibonacci. It does not matter how popular  Bitcoin -0.89%  has become, or how deep it has disrupted the financial sector, or how many institutional investors have come to invest in it -- the psychology behind a market cycle does not change. 

I don't really encourage anyone to short  Bitcoin -0.89% , but in all honesty, don't expect the bulls to fly anytime soon. Like I said before, this correction that we are having right now is the ""MOTHER OF ALL CORRECTIONS"" after a 4-year-long bull cycle since the 2013 correction... and we are just halfway through.

My best idea ever, taking some time off the last 2 days :) The whales just continue to play their little games by squeezing leveraged short and long positions out of the market. Can't play them, it's just too easy. Maybe it's time we retail traders stand together, combine our  volume  and use their own game against them. Yeah, maybe we could even make a blockbuster movie about this :) I love me some science fiction :) LOL  

My last update of the previous analysis i showed 2 important support levels where the price could bounce up from. The first support around 7350 did the trick and the price got pushed back to 7700. From that point on i told my members that i thought i was seeing distribution, but it was still very confusing to figure out what was going on. TA was showing  bullish  signs, that  bull flag  was very strong and was even turning slowly up and was about to squeeze upwards. But of course out of no where the price got dumped, the move we saw a few hours ago. After that 200 point drop the price got pushed up again to 7700 like that dump was a glitch. If your a whale, why not push out leveraged traders and take your money while your accumulating or distributing. It's like a bonus, like the cherry on top :)  

Anyway, in this chart we can see allot of similarities of what is going on. As you know i have been saying i am still  bearish  for the medium term, but i just could not say what was going to happen on the short term. 2 days ago after we finally dropped out of that  wedge , i said we would have 2 options.  
- Break those 2 support levels from the last update of my previous chart (73xx and 71xx) 
- Make a higher low at those same support levels and make another move up above the high.  
 
As we can see in the chart, the  fractal  is not 100% identical so it's no guarantee that the 7700 high we just saw is the high already and that we start to move down. But based on this  fractal , i don't want to see the price get above the 7800/7900. This  fractal  confirms my  bearish  view as well. That's why TA is so great, you can turn any chart to fit your view :). 

Even without this  fractal , i just give it a very small chance that 7K price action is the fundament of a low to start another bull rally, i just highly doubt that. I want to see more  volume  to begin with and at least  double bottom  kind of formation. So the minimum i expect is a test of the 7100/6900in the coming week or 2. But the movement i have in mind for the med term is a drop below the 7K to form a big V shape low. If we get to see that, than i might even become  bullish  for the rest of the year :).  

As long as the price stays above the 73xx, we have to assume the bulls are still in control and we should see another wave up. So for me the 73xx is an important turning point.

					This is my bigger picture, think this bearish triangle is still 100% in play. I think if bulls can't break the 7800/7900 the bearish version is probably going to happen. Can't say HOW it will go, this blue line is just a guess. But a big V shape low would be the most bullish for the long term. I still think we are seeing distribution here. The only way this idea can be countered, is through a big increase of buying volume, if that doesn't happen, i think it's only a matter of time.

The price took a small dump but the volume was low so no real read on what the intent was. So we might see another move up, if we start to see a small pump that takes out the 7800, be aware of a fake breakout. The blue line is a possibility of what the move could look like IF we move up and if the breakout fails. If that happens than we will probably get confirmation if the price breaks the 7600ish. If we break the 7800 it should stay above the 7700 to confirm another move up. Not much more to say about what's going on.

37,1528359434.0,Taiwan_Bear,2618 (Double top & 0.618 pull-back) - do not miss it!!,"
In the last couple of TAs I have mentioned the “2618 pattern” and have been asked what 2618 means. Sorry for taking it so long as it took me quite a while to put everything altogether. But, as promised, I have explained below the rules and trade setups for the 2618 pattern.  

What are the rules/setups/steps for 2618?  
1.	Form a  double top  (Note #1)  
2.	Neckline has to be broken  
3.	After price found support at point (b), wait for pull back to 0.618 fib retracement of (a)(b)  
4.	After price retraced to 0.618, look for confluence and sell (eg. Structures,  trendlines  ,  double top  on a lower time frame,  rsi  divergence,  bearish pin bar  ,  inside bar  break down etc.) (Note #2)  
5.	Stop loss to be set above  double top 
6.	Set Take Profit levels (Note #3)  

Note #1 ( Double top ):  
The first step for the formation of 2618 is to form a  double top  at key resistance levels. Why at key resistance levels? Because we want to avoid fake double tops which can occur occasionally.  

There are some variations between various resources (books, websites) regarding the definitions of “double top”. The main differences occur where:  
a)	Some said for a  double top  to be valid, the wick of the 2nd top cannot exceed the wick of the 1st top; whereas, others said:  
b)	The wick of the 2nd top can exceed the wick of the 1st top but the candle close of the 2nd top CANNOT exceed the wick of the 1st top; or  
c)	The wick of the 2nd top can exceed the wick of the 1st top and the candle close of the 2nd top CAN exceed the wick of the 1st top; or  
d)	The wick of the 2nd top meets at least the candle close of the 1st top; or  
e)	The body of the 2nd top cannot exceed the body of the 1st top  

Personally, I would say all the above definitions work just fine although I do prefer definition a) because it means that the selling pressure is strong and the bulls fail to make a higher high. When there is a higher high formed in a downtrend, it can mean the downtrend has reversed and therefore you might not want to sell when the price pulls back to the 0.618 fib retracement.  

Note #2 ( 0.618 retracement ):  
When the price pulls back to 0.618, it does not mean to sell straight away. There must be more than one reason to sell other than the 0.618 retrace. The more reasons the better. In this example, you can see there are certainly structures (key resistance levels) at the 0.618 retrace. As well, there was a  double top  formed on the lower time frame. Consequently, you can sell.  

After  BTC -0.88%  hit the 0.618 retrace the first time, the price dropped from $9735 to $8650. but quickly bounced back to the 0.618 retrace level. That was a second & better opportunity to sell. Not only did  BTC -0.88%  form a  double top  on the larger time frame, but also with a  bearish  divergence on the 4hr time frame. Accordingly, you have more reasons to sell.  

Note #3 (Set take profit)  
Same as the rules of “Double top”, there are some variations as to which price level should you take profits. Personally, I would stick to the below:  
1)	First, take profit when risk/reward ratio hits 1:1 (recommend to take 30% - 50% profits and adjust the SL of the remaining positions to break-even)

 BTC -0.88%  is on the verge of breaking to a daily higher high on the bounce if the bulls can see a push this morning. 
If we reject from here the daily will form a lower high and we will see a tightening pattern within the highlighted  support and resistance  lines.  
Important for the bulls to show up or we could stay in this range into tomorrow.  
Healthy consolidation after the most recent bull move and the 15 min chart needs to change the trend.  
Also look to  EMA  12 support on the 4 hour and hourly.  
Another morning like yesterday with the bulls comfortable as worst case, we likely stay in the tightening pattern if bulls cannot prove themselves.

The current situation of  Bitcoin -0.88%  is quite difficult. We are on a clear treshold. A lot of traders are saying that we are on a clear downtrend, but the same amount of people are claiming that we will have our reversal soon. 

This article tries to sum up all important information you have to need! 

1: Retracement of a parabolic uptrend: 
There is a rule of thumb for the retracement of a parabolic uptrend. We should retrace to approx. the 0.786  Fibonacci Retracement  +/- 10%! 
Depending where we start the count, we are already in that target. Although both ways (blue and red) have still some space for a further downwave! 







2: The bloody support of Bitcoin: 
The average cost of mining one  bitcoin -0.88%  are at USA/Russia approx. 4700$ and at 3100$ for china! 
A drop below a target of 4700$ would be savage. Nevertheless, i can't image that we will hit that target. 







3: Manipulation of  Bitcoin -0.88%  and the Bart Simpson Pattern: 
A friend of mine found some unusual patterns in the orderbooks of several exchanges: 
https://twitter.com/CryptoSyndrome 
Altcoins are manipulated on a daily basis. It seems that  bitcoin -0.88%  is now affected to this too, which causes all these 3-5% pump and dumps. 
Thus, we are forming all the time the Bartin Simpsons Patterns. 

4: Similarity to 2014: 
Bitcoin -0.88%  now: 






Bitcoin -0.88%  2014: 







5: Deminishing downtrend and a strong support 
If we see the falling  wedges  as the force of the downtrend, then the force is diminishing! 
Furthermore we have strong support which is holding now for the 4th time! 







6: The Indicators 
Having a look at the indicators at 2D, we have a good potential for an upwave now. 
The  volume  is deminishing which should indicate a breakout soon. 
The  MACD  is about to cross, the  RSI  was slightly overbought and is heading up like the  Stoch .  RSI . 
The 200  EMA  is slighty under the current price and act as a support. 

7: The symetrical Triangle 
The theory says, that we should have in a  sym -1.72% . triangle 5 times an  ABC  wave. The waves are not perfect, but we can construct them. 






As you can see, the last four ABC-Waves formed always a 1:1 extention, which indicates that we have finished wave 5. 

8: A possible Head and Shoulders 
Even if this is not the most perfect  Head and Shoulders  Pattern, it's still valid! 
We are currently at the neckline, which is a strong and important resistance. Breaking upwards should indicate a good uptrend. 







9: The magic  6th 0.00%  of the month 






Suprisingly we have on every  6th 0.00%  of the month a reversal. Why is that??? 
One reason could be the  CME Group Futures  with dates for the settlements always nearby the  6th 0.00%  of the month! 
http://www.cmegroup.com 

10: Longterm  Bullish  TA 
The whole pattern could be seen as a big  bullish pennant . 







11: Shortterm  Bullish  TA 
Leading diagonal  starting wave1 of an  Elliott Wave , since we have now an impulse wave, after the 5x  ABC  pattern inside the triangle is finished. 
Our target should be at the top of the triangle nearby 8600-8800$. 







12: Longterm  Bearish  TA 
We also can argue, that we are currenty in an downtrend and the  sym -1.72% . triangle just continuing the trend. 
Our target should be nearby 6000$ which is also a finished downwards  Elliott Wave .

Nothing is happening in the market:  volatility  has become extinct and coins' trading fallen out of fashion. Range-bound bots and robotic humans absolutely prosper in this environment. The price was unable to break the 7700 threshold. For me this is a  bearish  signal. Indicators provide mixed signals, so let's examine wave structure. The move from May 29 is a  3-wave -0.12%  correction within a larger downtrend. A price drop below 7500 would confirm this scenario.

					Impulse Wave Truncation (Truncated Fifth) - 
Truncated 5th wave is when the market has become so over-extended in Wave 3 that there is not much force left for the impulse wave to come to a proper completion. So when this happens, there is a chance that the last wave of the impulse, Wave 5, will not reach the end of Wave 3 before the market starts correcting in the opposite direction. At this point, the market is just too exhausted. This condition is often called a “failure” or a “Truncation.”

I can see many people still believe that we are going inside a  descending triangle . I also believed this in my idea that i shard on may 1st: 



 

Things can change so quickly and if we didn't adapt to the changes then someone will. That's why i believe that we have to be in fast adapt mode in this market. Doesn't mean that you need to change without checking yourself. I try to find 2-3 confirmations before i change my idea on something. This includes pattern changes, trend changes etc 

There are 21 corrective wave patterns in EW which is categorized into major 3 corrective wave patterns: 

Zigzag  (5-3-5) 
Flat (3-3-5) 
Triangle (3-3-3-3-3) 

And other patterns are combinations of the above which is:  

Double three (A combination of two corrective patterns above) 
Triple three (A combination of three corrective patterns above) 

So what i can see now is that we are in two double three combination corrective wave pattern: 








More info here:  

https://elliottwave-forecast.com/elliott-wave-theory/#corrective-waves 

Confirmations: 

1. Wave ((i)) of C is 1.6k and ((v)) is going to be completed below the triangle 
2. Wave (E) of the triangle can't go beyond the triangle.  
3. This has happened twice before in 2013 & 2015 

Each wave  got 3 subwaves (a,b &c) inside and we are in the subwave c of ((y)) of Y which is an impulsive wave. 

Impulsive waves: 1,3,5,a,c 
Corrective waves: 2,4,b 

Normal Fibo Ratios for these waves are: 

wave 2 = 0.5 - 0.8 of wave 1  
wave 3 = 1.236 - 1.618 of wave 1  
wave 4 = 0.5 - 0.618 of wave 3  
wave 5 = 0.618 - 1 of wave 1  
wave B = 0.5 - 0.8 of wave A  
wave C = 0.618 - 1.236 of wave A  

Now if you check what happened in subwave a of ((y)) of Y you can see that: 

Wave (i) of a: 985$ 
Wave (ii) of a: 434$  
Wave ( iii 0.01% ) of a: 1207$  
Wave (iv) of a: 691$ [~0.618 of Wave ( iii 0.01% )] 
Wave (v) of a: 950$  








I have seen  BTC -0.88%  impulsive waves fibo ratios almost the same as the previous impulsive wave fibo ratios. 
Now if you apply the same for the last wave C of (E) this is what you get: 

Wave ((i)) of c: 1587$ 
Wave ((ii)) of c  = 793$ 
Wave (( iii 0.01% )) of c  = 1961$ 
Wave ((iv)) of c [~0.618 of Wave (( iii 0.01% ))] = 1212$ 
Wave ((v)) of c  = 1587$ 








Also note that Wave ((iv)) might not retrace upto 0.618 of Wave (( iii 0.01% )) as everyone will be in panic mode by that time so minimum retracement would be around 0.386 of Wave (( iii 0.01% )) which is around 756$ and this is why i can see it goes down to 5k level or little bit more towards 4.7k which is the lowest level of the  support zone  (orange dotted lines) 








So 3 Possible Support lines for reversal would be 

1. Blue: 5800 - 6100 (Only possible if Wave ((v)) is truncated) 
2. Orange: 4700 - 5000 (This is most likely where we heading)  
3. Red: 4100 - 4400 (Only possible if Wave (( iii 0.01% )) is extended)

 Bitcoin -0.88%  has recently developed an interesting pattern of completing a  bullish  and  bearish  cycle on the sixth of every month in an alternating order. As we can see in the chart above, a fall is followed by a rise. This has happened twice before and is expected to happen again now on the  6th 0.00%  of June, 2018. This time  Bitcoin -0.88%  will finish a  bearish  cycle and I expected to begin the next  bullish  cycle at least till the end of  6th 0.00%  of July, 2018. 

This pattern of rise and fall is also supported by other patterns on the chart that signal a  bullish  reversal. The support line has also held firmly and if this pattern of alternating rise and fall ensues,  Bitcoin -0.88%  could very well make new highs by the end of the year. The  RSI  is recovering from oversold levels and has now approached a normal.  Bitcoin -0.88%  is currently at a favorable point for  bullish  entries. The price broke a long term resistance as it break past the downtrend line in April, 2018. This was a big accomplishment for the bulls but the lack of confidence pulled the price back to the support line. Currently, the price is just above the support line and appears to be all set for a  bullish  comeback but the reality is, there are not enough bulls in the market. 

The past few months have been devastating for the price of  Bitcoin -0.88%  ( BTC -0.88% ) and a lot of investors are still running scared. Institutional investors are looking for more clarity regarding regulations concerning cryptocurrencies and also safer ways to invest and store their coins. As for retail investors, most of them comprise of first time investors who have never traded any financial asset before. So, when they saw that  Bitcoin -0.88%  ( BTC -0.88% ) is making 20% gains every day, they thought this could go on forever and jumped with both feet, only to find the carpet pulled under from their feet. Big investors have always played small investors as cannon fodder and have gotten away with their schemes even in regulated markets like forex or the stock market. Cryptocurrencies is a new market with no proper regulations which means it is natural to expect that those who can afford to not play by the rules, most likely won’t.

Hello friends,  

It's been a while since my last post; lack of time and an urge to do more research has mainly driven me to take a break from posting ideas on TradingView. I am still in the process of doing more research and study, but I figure posting once in a while couldn't hurt. 

Since I have become recently very convinced about this, I am outlining a very possible situation with  Bitcoin -0.89%  where the  trend line  we have been on since early October breaks, reaching around a temporary low of $5000. This is examined on the  daily chart , since this is one of the best charts to examine trends of this size. I have to first and foremost say that I am not trying to spread fear, I know many people do not like to hear  bearish  ideas, but  technical analysis  is ultimately a rational exercise, and I feel that possibilities with very strong signs should be explored. 

There are a few things to look at, but I first want to talk about the big picture with, long-term  support and resistance  lines. I think most people can agree that there was a very significant downtrending resistance line that began from the peak of the  ATH 0.63%  in late December, to the low of around $6400 (thick red line). After the break from that line, it seems we moved into a sideways trend, bouncing back and forth between an emerging downtrending resistance line (light red) and a support line that we seem to have been respecting since mid-October (light green); at least this appears to be the case with the lows, where the angle's effectiveness appears very strongly. Finally, based on previous bounces, we can establish a support of around $5000-$5300 (I've thus created a small  support zone  around that range, in dark green), as well as lower supports around $3200 and $2000 (though I do not believe these will be reached, in dark green).   

Now, onto the analysis - it's no secret that  Bitcoin -0.89%  has been squeezing in, ready for a significant move either upwards or downwards. Initially I considered the upwards move to be more likely due to the significant media attention cryptocurrency has been receiving, but after viewing previous market cycles of  Bitcoin -0.89%  (check 2013), it seems clear to me that the  bearish  scenario of closing in on the market cycle is very likely, and should at the very least be prepared for with proper risk management. According to Dow Theory, which is said to have laid the foundations of modern  technical analysis , history repeats itself, and this is a situation where we forced to consider this. 

Should we break from the line, we will likely fall straight down to the $5000-$5000 area, where we will shoot back up and bounce towards around $6700 or so (maybe a little less). From there one, we will likely enter a sideways trend, which we will continue until we see higher highs and higher lows and parabolic movement returns, which could lead to us challenging the all-time high, and hitting $35k-$50k. 

NOTE: I seem to have reached the max character limit for this section of the idea, so I will continue my text below.

Comment:
					Onto the short-term: 


Scenario A: 

The reason why I have drawn this movement into a pennant is this way, is simply because we have been moving through this ascending triangle for quite a while now (May 23rd to today). I don't think that the pattern will be sufficient to directly lead into a strong sell-off, but we should consider that the size of ascending triangle suggests a small movement downwards at the very least, which can create a higher low, and thus move into position into a bearish pennant. Why would a bearish pennant occur here and not have a bounce to $8500-$8700? The reason is in positioning - the huge downtrend (May 5th to May 26th) creates a very nice flagpole in which it hits around the $5000 area very perfectly, and thus I would not be surprised if this happens. 

Second reason: on the Stoch RSI indicator on the daily chart, it appears to be dangerously high, which would suggest it being oversold. For the most part, it seems to have called lows and highs, at least to some extent. This overdrawn movement may very well have increased the likelyhood of Bitcoin being oversold. This could suggest that this is the last step into a sharp downturn, but this does not preclude Situation B. Volume has also been steadily decreasing, but this is the case with any sort of consolidation, I believe. 

Finally, the lines I have drawn below the triangle are simply bounces that I think seem fairly reasonable. The length from to support to the lines correlate with the length of the flagpole, of course, though it may seem chopped off due to the huge line from the long-term support downwards. 


Scenario B: 

This is much simpler, Bitcoin hits the upper resistance line, bounces off, challenges the lower support line, and we potentially see a break, and the rest unfolds from there. 


----------------------------------------------------------------------- 


With all this being said, do not fear if you are hoping for more parabolic movement - this likely will not be the end, and will simply be the set up for a long, drawn out sideways movement until the first signs of bullish activity begin and we start all over again. If you are longing around here, please consider using risk management, prepare for every possibility. If you are shorting, the same applies. 

Please trade with care. I wish the best to all traders!

Comment:
					This really is a very minor note, but I just want to emphasize that the rising wedge (which I erroneously refer to as an ascending triangle, a bad habit I have) entering a bearish pennant is more based on intuition than anything. Also, this pennant is mainly based on the conservative assumption that the break will happen at 7900, if it happens at 7700 where we seem to be general resistance, the pennant would look something like this:

Jun 7




I am Mid term-bullish on  BTC -0.89%  going into the end of this week, but looking to get into the market on a pull back to occur before I get in to the market.  The jury is still out as to whether this weekly bear trend is ready to turn around.  

We can see that both the  RSI  and  MFI  are both  Bullish  on the daily having bottomed when reaching oversold on both at c. $7k support where we found our longer term  trend line . 

We are currently in the process of meeting the Tenkan (blue line) as I write this, so in the very short term, I am looking for a pull back to $7550 range for an entry.  One of the main reasons for this is that on the 4hour timeframes we are close to completing an edge to edge trade so the risk reward doesn’t fit my profile, however a break out from the cloud or above the Tenkan around $7777 will make me enter the market. 

The  RSI  and  MFI  have both been excellent indicators in this bear market.  Whenever  RSI  has gone above the 60 and the  MFI  80; its time to exit the market from a  bullish  trade and consider shorting as it progresses higher.   

Based on the  RSI ,  MFI  trends and the fact that we will run into the Kijun at just around $8-8.2k, I will be scalling out at this  bearish  confluence level to start looking for pull backs and reassessment as i believe it to be a key point as  

Best case scenario this trade would yield a 10% return before leverage. 
This is for illustrative purposes only, please DYOR and goodluck with your trading.

So the pullback trade that we were looking at worked out & has made it's way back to the neckline level of structure. We are now at what i like to call a ""decision point"" Essentially IF price is able to violate this current level od structure THEN we're likely to continue to our next price projection.  

Something that a lot of newer traders don't understand is that when it comes to bigger moves, the market will often provide multiple opportunities to get involved. For those who don't rush and for those who don't get discouraged. If you perform consistent analysis you can often find multiple ways to involve yourself in a trade even if you missed the first strike.

My best idea ever, taking some time off the last 2 days :) The whales just continue to play their little games by squeezing leveraged short and long positions out of the market. Can't play them, it's just too easy. Maybe it's time we retail traders stand together, combine our  volume  and use their own game against them. Yeah, maybe we could even make a blockbuster movie about this :) I love me some science fiction :) LOL  

My last update of the previous analysis i showed 2 important support levels where the price could bounce up from. The first support around 7350 did the trick and the price got pushed back to 7700. From that point on i told my members that i thought i was seeing distribution, but it was still very confusing to figure out what was going on. TA was showing  bullish  signs, that  bull flag  was very strong and was even turning slowly up and was about to squeeze upwards. But of course out of no where the price got dumped, the move we saw a few hours ago. After that 200 point drop the price got pushed up again to 7700 like that dump was a glitch. If your a whale, why not push out leveraged traders and take your money while your accumulating or distributing. It's like a bonus, like the cherry on top :)  

Anyway, in this chart we can see allot of similarities of what is going on. As you know i have been saying i am still  bearish  for the medium term, but i just could not say what was going to happen on the short term. 2 days ago after we finally dropped out of that  wedge , i said we would have 2 options.  
- Break those 2 support levels from the last update of my previous chart (73xx and 71xx) 
- Make a higher low at those same support levels and make another move up above the high.  
 
As we can see in the chart, the  fractal  is not 100% identical so it's no guarantee that the 7700 high we just saw is the high already and that we start to move down. But based on this  fractal , i don't want to see the price get above the 7800/7900. This  fractal  confirms my  bearish  view as well. That's why TA is so great, you can turn any chart to fit your view :). 

Even without this  fractal , i just give it a very small chance that 7K price action is the fundament of a low to start another bull rally, i just highly doubt that. I want to see more  volume  to begin with and at least  double bottom  kind of formation. So the minimum i expect is a test of the 7100/6900in the coming week or 2. But the movement i have in mind for the med term is a drop below the 7K to form a big V shape low. If we get to see that, than i might even become  bullish  for the rest of the year :).  

As long as the price stays above the 73xx, we have to assume the bulls are still in control and we should see another wave up. So for me the 73xx is an important turning point.

Comment:
					At the moment it looks like bulls are trying to push higher, this bull flag/triangle is still very strong. So no sign of weakness yet! First small sign would be a drop below 7620/7600. Bulls need to break 7700

Comment:
					This is my bigger picture, think this bearish triangle is still 100% in play. I think if bulls can't break the 7800/7900 the bearish version is probably going to happen. Can't say HOW it will go, this blue line is just a guess. But a big V shape low would be the most bullish for the long term. I still think we are seeing distribution here. The only way this idea can be countered, is through a big increase of buying volume, if that doesn't happen, i think it's only a matter of time.

					Lower time frame we can see a new upwards channel and maybe even a rising wedge. From the looks of it, it's slowly going down to test the support line again. Depending on what will happen there we can make a better prediction for the rest of the day.

					What a surprise, nothing has changed :) 

The price took a small dump but the volume was low so no real read on what the intent was. So we might see another move up, if we start to see a small pump that takes out the 7800, be aware of a fake breakout. The blue line is a possibility of what the move could look like IF we move up and if the breakout fails. If that happens than we will probably get confirmation if the price breaks the 7600ish. If we break the 7800 it should stay above the 7700 to confirm another move up. Not much more to say about what's going on.

55,1528359434.0,Taiwan_Bear,2618 (Double top & 0.618 pull-back) - do not miss it!!,"
In the last couple of TAs I have mentioned the “2618 pattern” and have been asked what 2618 means. Sorry for taking it so long as it took me quite a while to put everything altogether. But, as promised, I have explained below the rules and trade setups for the 2618 pattern.  

What are the rules/setups/steps for 2618?  
1.	Form a  double top  (Note #1)  
2.	Neckline has to be broken  
3.	After price found support at point (b), wait for pull back to 0.618 fib retracement of (a)(b)  
4.	After price retraced to 0.618, look for confluence and sell (eg. Structures,  trendlines  ,  double top  on a lower time frame,  rsi  divergence,  bearish pin bar  ,  inside bar  break down etc.) (Note #2)  
5.	Stop loss to be set above  double top 
6.	Set Take Profit levels (Note #3)  

Note #1 ( Double top ):  
The first step for the formation of 2618 is to form a  double top  at key resistance levels. Why at key resistance levels? Because we want to avoid fake double tops which can occur occasionally.  

There are some variations between various resources (books, websites) regarding the definitions of “double top”. The main differences occur where:  
a)	Some said for a  double top  to be valid, the wick of the 2nd top cannot exceed the wick of the 1st top; whereas, others said:  
b)	The wick of the 2nd top can exceed the wick of the 1st top but the candle close of the 2nd top CANNOT exceed the wick of the 1st top; or  
c)	The wick of the 2nd top can exceed the wick of the 1st top and the candle close of the 2nd top CAN exceed the wick of the 1st top; or  
d)	The wick of the 2nd top meets at least the candle close of the 1st top; or  
e)	The body of the 2nd top cannot exceed the body of the 1st top  

Personally, I would say all the above definitions work just fine although I do prefer definition a) because it means that the selling pressure is strong and the bulls fail to make a higher high. When there is a higher high formed in a downtrend, it can mean the downtrend has reversed and therefore you might not want to sell when the price pulls back to the 0.618 fib retracement.  

Note #2 ( 0.618 retracement ):  
When the price pulls back to 0.618, it does not mean to sell straight away. There must be more than one reason to sell other than the 0.618 retrace. The more reasons the better. In this example, you can see there are certainly structures (key resistance levels) at the 0.618 retrace. As well, there was a  double top  formed on the lower time frame. Consequently, you can sell.  

After  BTC -0.89%  hit the 0.618 retrace the first time, the price dropped from $9735 to $8650. but quickly bounced back to the 0.618 retrace level. That was a second & better opportunity to sell. Not only did  BTC -0.89%  form a  double top  on the larger time frame, but also with a  bearish  divergence on the 4hr time frame. Accordingly, you have more reasons to sell.  

Note #3 (Set take profit)  
Same as the rules of “Double top”, there are some variations as to which price level should you take profits. Personally, I would stick to the below:  
1)	First, take profit when risk/reward ratio hits 1:1 (recommend to take 30% - 50% profits and adjust the SL of the remaining positions to break-even)  
2)	When price hits the same price level as the low after the neckline is broken ((b) point in this example)  
3)	When price hits 1.272 fib extension of (a)(b)  
4)	When price hits point (d) (using  AB=CD  pattern. If you are not sure what the rules of  AB=CD  are, you can refer to my previous TA in which I have attached the link below)  
5)	If in a one-way market (heavily bearish/bullish), you can always keep 10% to 20% of your positions and take profits when risk/reward ratio hits 1:5 or even 1:10

 BTC -0.89%  is on the verge of breaking to a daily higher high on the bounce if the bulls can see a push this morning. 
If we reject from here the daily will form a lower high and we will see a tightening pattern within the highlighted  support and resistance  lines.  
Important for the bulls to show up or we could stay in this range into tomorrow.  
Healthy consolidation after the most recent bull move and the 15 min chart needs to change the trend.  
Also look to  EMA  12 support on the 4 hour and hourly.  
Another morning like yesterday with the bulls comfortable as worst case, we likely stay in the tightening pattern if bulls cannot prove themselves.

The current situation of  Bitcoin -0.89%  is quite difficult. We are on a clear treshold. A lot of traders are saying that we are on a clear downtrend, but the same amount of people are claiming that we will have our reversal soon. 

This article tries to sum up all important information you have to need! 

1: Retracement of a parabolic uptrend: 
There is a rule of thumb for the retracement of a parabolic uptrend. We should retrace to approx. the 0.786  Fibonacci Retracement  +/- 10%! 
Depending where we start the count, we are already in that target. Although both ways (blue and red) have still some space for a further downwave! 







2: The bloody support of Bitcoin: 
The average cost of mining one  bitcoin -0.89%  are at USA/Russia approx. 4700$ and at 3100$ for china! 
A drop below a target of 4700$ would be savage. Nevertheless, i can't image that we will hit that target. 







3: Manipulation of  Bitcoin -0.89%  and the Bart Simpson Pattern: 
A friend of mine found some unusual patterns in the orderbooks of several exchanges: 
https://twitter.com/CryptoSyndrome 
Altcoins are manipulated on a daily basis. It seems that  bitcoin -0.89%  is now affected to this too, which causes all these 3-5% pump and dumps. 
Thus, we are forming all the time the Bartin Simpsons Patterns. 

4: Similarity to 2014: 
Bitcoin -0.89%  now: 






Bitcoin -0.89%  2014: 







5: Deminishing downtrend and a strong support 
If we see the falling  wedges  as the force of the downtrend, then the force is diminishing! 
Furthermore we have strong support which is holding now for the 4th time! 







6: The Indicators 
Having a look at the indicators at 2D, we have a good potential for an upwave now. 
The  volume  is deminishing which should indicate a breakout soon. 
The  MACD  is about to cross, the  RSI  was slightly overbought and is heading up like the  Stoch .  RSI . 
The 200  EMA  is slighty under the current price and act as a support. 

7: The symetrical Triangle 
The theory says, that we should have in a  sym -0.80% . triangle 5 times an  ABC  wave. The waves are not perfect, but we can construct them. 






As you can see, the last four ABC-Waves formed always a 1:1 extention, which indicates that we have finished wave 5. 

8: A possible Head and Shoulders 
Even if this is not the most perfect  Head and Shoulders  Pattern, it's still valid! 
We are currently at the neckline, which is a strong and important resistance. Breaking upwards should indicate a good uptrend. 







9: The magic  6th 0.00%  of the month 






Suprisingly we have on every  6th 0.00%  of the month a reversal. Why is that??? 
One reason could be the  CME Group Futures  with dates for the settlements always nearby the  6th 0.00%  of the month! 
http://www.cmegroup.com 

10: Longterm  Bullish  TA 
The whole pattern could be seen as a big  bullish pennant . 







11: Shortterm  Bullish  TA 
Leading diagonal  starting wave1 of an  Elliott Wave , since we have now an impulse wave, after the 5x  ABC  pattern inside the triangle is finished. 
Our target should be at the top of the triangle nearby 8600-8800$. 







12: Longterm  Bearish  TA 
We also can argue, that we are currenty in an downtrend and the  sym -0.80% . triangle just continuing the trend. 
Our target should be nearby 6000$ which is also a finished downwards  Elliott Wave .

Nothing is happening in the market:  volatility  has become extinct and coins' trading fallen out of fashion. Range-bound bots and robotic humans absolutely prosper in this environment. The price was unable to break the 7700 threshold. For me this is a  bearish  signal. Indicators provide mixed signals, so let's examine wave structure. The move from May 29 is a  3-wave -0.12%  correction within a larger downtrend. A price drop below 7500 would confirm this scenario.

					Impulse Wave Truncation (Truncated Fifth) - 
Truncated 5th wave is when the market has become so over-extended in Wave 3 that there is not much force left for the impulse wave to come to a proper completion. So when this happens, there is a chance that the last wave of the impulse, Wave 5, will not reach the end of Wave 3 before the market starts correcting in the opposite direction. At this point, the market is just too exhausted. This condition is often called a “failure” or a “Truncation.”

I can see many people still believe that we are going inside a  descending triangle . I also believed this in my idea that i shard on may 1st: 



 

Things can change so quickly and if we didn't adapt to the changes then someone will. That's why i believe that we have to be in fast adapt mode in this market. Doesn't mean that you need to change without checking yourself. I try to find 2-3 confirmations before i change my idea on something. This includes pattern changes, trend changes etc 

There are 21 corrective wave patterns in EW which is categorized into major 3 corrective wave patterns: 

Zigzag  (5-3-5) 
Flat (3-3-5) 
Triangle (3-3-3-3-3) 

And other patterns are combinations of the above which is:  

Double three (A combination of two corrective patterns above) 
Triple three (A combination of three corrective patterns above) 

So what i can see now is that we are in two double three combination corrective wave pattern: 








More info here:  

https://elliottwave-forecast.com/elliott-wave-theory/#corrective-waves 

Confirmations: 

1. Wave ((i)) of C is 1.6k and ((v)) is going to be completed below the triangle 
2. Wave (E) of the triangle can't go beyond the triangle.  
3. This has happened twice before in 2013 & 2015 

Each wave  got 3 subwaves (a,b &c) inside and we are in the subwave c of ((y)) of Y which is an impulsive wave. 

Impulsive waves: 1,3,5,a,c 
Corrective waves: 2,4,b 

Normal Fibo Ratios for these waves are: 

wave 2 = 0.5 - 0.8 of wave 1  
wave 3 = 1.236 - 1.618 of wave 1  
wave 4 = 0.5 - 0.618 of wave 3  
wave 5 = 0.618 - 1 of wave 1  
wave B = 0.5 - 0.8 of wave A  
wave C = 0.618 - 1.236 of wave A  

Now if you check what happened in subwave a of ((y)) of Y you can see that: 

Wave (i) of a: 985$ 
Wave (ii) of a: 434$  
Wave ( iii             ) of a: 1207$  
Wave (iv) of a: 691$ [~0.618 of Wave ( iii             )] 
Wave (v) of a: 950$  








I have seen  BTC -0.88%  impulsive waves fibo ratios almost the same as the previous impulsive wave fibo ratios. 
Now if you apply the same for the last wave C of (E) this is what you get: 

Wave ((i)) of c: 1587$ 
Wave ((ii)) of c  = 793$ 
Wave (( iii             )) of c  = 1961$ 
Wave ((iv)) of c [~0.618 of Wave (( iii             ))] = 1212$ 
Wave ((v)) of c  = 1587$ 








Also note that Wave ((iv)) might not retrace upto 0.618 of Wave (( iii             )) as everyone will be in panic mode by that time so minimum retracement would be around 0.386 of Wave (( iii             )) which is around 756$ and this is why i can see it goes down to 5k level or little bit more towards 4.7k which is the lowest level of the  support zone  (orange dotted lines) 








So 3 Possible Support lines for reversal would be 

1. Blue: 5800 - 6100 (Only possible if Wave ((v)) is truncated) 
2. Orange: 4700 - 5000 (This is most likely where we heading)  
3. Red: 4100 - 4400 (Only possible if Wave (( iii             )) is extended)

 Bitcoin -0.95%  has recently developed an interesting pattern of completing a  bullish  and  bearish  cycle on the sixth of every month in an alternating order. As we can see in the chart above, a fall is followed by a rise. This has happened twice before and is expected to happen again now on the  6th 0.00%  of June, 2018. This time  Bitcoin -0.95%  will finish a  bearish  cycle and I expected to begin the next  bullish  cycle at least till the end of  6th 0.00%  of July, 2018. 

This pattern of rise and fall is also supported by other patterns on the chart that signal a  bullish  reversal. The support line has also held firmly and if this pattern of alternating rise and fall ensues,  Bitcoin -0.95%  could very well make new highs by the end of the year. The  RSI  is recovering from oversold levels and has now approached a normal.  Bitcoin -0.95%  is currently at a favorable point for  bullish  entries. The price broke a long term resistance as it break past the downtrend line in April, 2018. This was a big accomplishment for the bulls but the lack of confidence pulled the price back to the support line. Currently, the price is just above the support line and appears to be all set for a  bullish  comeback but the reality is, there are not enough bulls in the market. 

The past few months have been devastating for the price of  Bitcoin -0.95%  ( BTC -0.95% ) and a lot of investors are still running scared. Institutional investors are looking for more clarity regarding regulations concerning cryptocurrencies and also safer ways to invest and store their coins. As for retail investors, most of them comprise of first time investors who have never traded any financial asset before. So, when they saw that  Bitcoin -0.95%  ( BTC -0.95% ) is making 20% gains every day, they thought this could go on forever and jumped with both feet, only to find the carpet pulled under from their feet. Big investors have always played small investors as cannon fodder and have gotten away with their schemes even in regulated markets like forex or the stock market. Cryptocurrencies is a new market with no proper regulations which means it is natural to expect that those who can afford to not play by the rules, most likely won’t.

Hello friends,  

It's been a while since my last post; lack of time and an urge to do more research has mainly driven me to take a break from posting ideas on TradingView. I am still in the process of doing more research and study, but I figure posting once in a while couldn't hurt. 

Since I have become recently very convinced about this, I am outlining a very possible situation with  Bitcoin -0.95%  where the  trend line  we have been on since early October breaks, reaching around a temporary low of $5000. This is examined on the  daily chart , since this is one of the best charts to examine trends of this size. I have to first and foremost say that I am not trying to spread fear, I know many people do not like to hear  bearish  ideas, but  technical analysis  is ultimately a rational exercise, and I feel that possibilities with very strong signs should be explored. 

There are a few things to look at, but I first want to talk about the big picture with, long-term  support and resistance  lines. I think most people can agree that there was a very significant downtrending resistance line that began from the peak of the  ATH 0.63%  in late December, to the low of around $6400 (thick red line). After the break from that line, it seems we moved into a sideways trend, bouncing back and forth between an emerging downtrending resistance line (light red) and a support line that we seem to have been respecting since mid-October (light green); at least this appears to be the case with the lows, where the angle's effectiveness appears very strongly. Finally, based on previous bounces, we can establish a support of around $5000-$5300 (I've thus created a small  support zone  around that range, in dark green), as well as lower supports around $3200 and $2000 (though I do not believe these will be reached, in dark green).   

Now, onto the analysis - it's no secret that  Bitcoin -0.95%  has been squeezing in, ready for a significant move either upwards or downwards. Initially I considered the upwards move to be more likely due to the significant media attention cryptocurrency has been receiving, but after viewing previous market cycles of  Bitcoin -0.95%  (check 2013), it seems clear to me that the  bearish  scenario of closing in on the market cycle is very likely, and should at the very least be prepared for with proper risk management. According to Dow Theory, which is said to have laid the foundations of modern  technical analysis , history repeats itself, and this is a situation where we forced to consider this. 

Should we break from the line, we will likely fall straight down to the $5000-$5000 area, where we will shoot back up and bounce towards around $6700 or so (maybe a little less). From there one, we will likely enter a sideways trend, which we will continue until we see higher highs and higher lows and parabolic movement returns, which could lead to us challenging the all-time high, and hitting $35k-$50k. 

NOTE: I seem to have reached the max character limit for this section of the idea, so I will continue my text below.

Comment:
					Onto the short-term: 


Scenario A: 

The reason why I have drawn this movement into a pennant is this way, is simply because we have been moving through this ascending triangle for quite a while now (May 23rd to today). I don't think that the pattern will be sufficient to directly lead into a strong sell-off, but we should consider that the size of ascending triangle suggests a small movement downwards at the very least, which can create a higher low, and thus move into position into a bearish pennant. Why would a bearish pennant occur here and not have a bounce to $8500-$8700? The reason is in positioning - the huge downtrend (May 5th to May 26th) creates a very nice flagpole in which it hits around the $5000 area very perfectly, and thus I would not be surprised if this happens. 

Second reason: on the Stoch RSI indicator on the daily chart, it appears to be dangerously high, which would suggest it being oversold. For the most part, it seems to have called lows and highs, at least to some extent. This overdrawn movement may very well have increased the likelyhood of Bitcoin being oversold. This could suggest that this is the last step into a sharp downturn, but this does not preclude Situation B. Volume has also been steadily decreasing, but this is the case with any sort of consolidation, I believe. 

Finally, the lines I have drawn below the triangle are simply bounces that I think seem fairly reasonable. The length from to support to the lines correlate with the length of the flagpole, of course, though it may seem chopped off due to the huge line from the long-term support downwards. 


Scenario B: 

This is much simpler, Bitcoin hits the upper resistance line, bounces off, challenges the lower support line, and we potentially see a break, and the rest unfolds from there. 


----------------------------------------------------------------------- 


With all this being said, do not fear if you are hoping for more parabolic movement - this likely will not be the end, and will simply be the set up for a long, drawn out sideways movement until the first signs of bullish activity begin and we start all over again. If you are longing around here, please consider using risk management, prepare for every possibility. If you are shorting, the same applies. 

Please trade with care. I wish the best to all traders!

Comment:
					This really is a very minor note, but I just want to emphasize that the rising wedge (which I erroneously refer to as an ascending triangle, a bad habit I have) entering a bearish pennant is more based on intuition than anything. Also, this pennant is mainly based on the conservative assumption that the break will happen at 7900, if it happens at 7700 where we seem to be general resistance, the pennant would look something like this:

I am Mid term-bullish on  BTC -0.95%  going into the end of this week, but looking to get into the market on a pull back to occur before I get in to the market.  The jury is still out as to whether this weekly bear trend is ready to turn around.  

We can see that both the  RSI  and  MFI  are both  Bullish  on the daily having bottomed when reaching oversold on both at c. $7k support where we found our longer term  trend line . 

We are currently in the process of meeting the Tenkan (blue line) as I write this, so in the very short term, I am looking for a pull back to $7550 range for an entry.  One of the main reasons for this is that on the 4hour timeframes we are close to completing an edge to edge trade so the risk reward doesn’t fit my profile, however a break out from the cloud or above the Tenkan around $7777 will make me enter the market. 

The  RSI  and  MFI  have both been excellent indicators in this bear market.  Whenever  RSI  has gone above the 60 and the  MFI  80; its time to exit the market from a  bullish  trade and consider shorting as it progresses higher.   

Based on the  RSI ,  MFI  trends and the fact that we will run into the Kijun at just around $8-8.2k, I will be scalling out at this  bearish  confluence level to start looking for pull backs and reassessment as i believe it to be a key point as  

Best case scenario this trade would yield a 10% return before leverage. 
This is for illustrative purposes only, please DYOR and goodluck with your trading.

So the pullback trade that we were looking at worked out & has made it's way back to the neckline level of structure. We are now at what i like to call a ""decision point"" Essentially IF price is able to violate this current level od structure THEN we're likely to continue to our next price projection.  

Something that a lot of newer traders don't understand is that when it comes to bigger moves, the market will often provide multiple opportunities to get involved. For those who don't rush and for those who don't get discouraged. If you perform consistent analysis you can often find multiple ways to involve yourself in a trade even if you missed the first strike.

This is the way markets move, If you question my charting check my previous posts. Its as simple as pie. We are going down, How long and how far is too soon to say. Here is a chart that we can understand the future price action and where to buy back. Before you guys start blasting my comment section with the time and how it may not be right thats correct. I am not calculating the time I'm just making a technical drawing of the directions that we will see in the next few months.  

Recent price action has clear signs of wash trading / market manipulation fud and lots of nonsense. Its hard to prove almost impossible so as a trader we just need to deal with it. Ideally the situation you are supposed to trade are critical break up and break down points to enter the trade. Dont enter or exit dumb trades and lose money. As an experienced trader you should be looking for shorts, I would not consider a long unless we are over $10-12k

I am never good with words so instead of writing paragraphs of clarification to justify my call for SHORT since my last posting, I have explained everything on my chart with the least words possible using Fibonacci. It does not matter how popular  Bitcoin -0.95%  has become, or how deep it has disrupted the financial sector, or how many institutional investors have come to invest in it -- the psychology behind a market cycle does not change. 

I don't really encourage anyone to short  Bitcoin -0.95% , but in all honesty, don't expect the bulls to fly anytime soon. Like I said before, this correction that we are having right now is the ""MOTHER OF ALL CORRECTIONS"" after a 4-year-long bull cycle since the 2013 correction... and we are just halfway through.

My best idea ever, taking some time off the last 2 days :) The whales just continue to play their little games by squeezing leveraged short and long positions out of the market. Can't play them, it's just too easy. Maybe it's time we retail traders stand together, combine our  volume  and use their own game against them. Yeah, maybe we could even make a blockbuster movie about this :) I love me some science fiction :) LOL  

My last update of the previous analysis i showed 2 important support levels where the price could bounce up from. The first support around 7350 did the trick and the price got pushed back to 7700. From that point on i told my members that i thought i was seeing distribution, but it was still very confusing to figure out what was going on. TA was showing  bullish  signs, that  bull flag  was very strong and was even turning slowly up and was about to squeeze upwards. But of course out of no where the price got dumped, the move we saw a few hours ago. After that 200 point drop the price got pushed up again to 7700 like that dump was a glitch. If your a whale, why not push out leveraged traders and take your money while your accumulating or distributing. It's like a bonus, like the cherry on top :)  

Anyway, in this chart we can see allot of similarities of what is going on. As you know i have been saying i am still  bearish  for the medium term, but i just could not say what was going to happen on the short term. 2 days ago after we finally dropped out of that  wedge , i said we would have 2 options.  
- Break those 2 support levels from the last update of my previous chart (73xx and 71xx) 
- Make a higher low at those same support levels and make another move up above the high.  
 
As we can see in the chart, the  fractal  is not 100% identical so it's no guarantee that the 7700 high we just saw is the high already and that we start to move down. But based on this  fractal , i don't want to see the price get above the 7800/7900. This  fractal  confirms my  bearish  view as well. That's why TA is so great, you can turn any chart to fit your view :). 

Even without this  fractal , i just give it a very small chance that 7K price action is the fundament of a low to start another bull rally, i just highly doubt that. I want to see more  volume  to begin with and at least  double bottom  kind of formation. So the minimum i expect is a test of the 7100/6900in the coming week or 2. But the movement i have in mind for the med term is a drop below the 7K to form a big V shape low. If we get to see that, than i might even become  bullish  for the rest of the year :).  

As long as the price stays above the 73xx, we have to assume the bulls are still in control and we should see another wave up. So for me the 73xx is an important turning point.

Comment:
					This is my bigger picture, think this bearish triangle is still 100% in play. I think if bulls can't break the 7800/7900 the bearish version is probably going to happen. Can't say HOW it will go, this blue line is just a guess. But a big V shape low would be the most bullish for the long term. I still think we are seeing distribution here. The only way this idea can be countered, is through a big increase of buying volume, if that doesn't happen, i think it's only a matter of time.

The price took a small dump but the volume was low so no real read on what the intent was. So we might see another move up, if we start to see a small pump that takes out the 7800, be aware of a fake breakout. The blue line is a possibility of what the move could look like IF we move up and if the breakout fails. If that happens than we will probably get confirmation if the price breaks the 7600ish. If we break the 7800 it should stay above the 7700 to confirm another move up. Not much more to say about what's going on.

73,1528359434.0,Taiwan_Bear,2618 (Double top & 0.618 pull-back) - do not miss it!!,"
In the last couple of TAs I have mentioned the “2618 pattern” and have been asked what 2618 means. Sorry for taking it so long as it took me quite a while to put everything altogether. But, as promised, I have explained below the rules and trade setups for the 2618 pattern.  

What are the rules/setups/steps for 2618?  
1.	Form a  double top  (Note #1)  
2.	Neckline has to be broken  
3.	After price found support at point (b), wait for pull back to 0.618 fib retracement of (a)(b)  
4.	After price retraced to 0.618, look for confluence and sell (eg. Structures,  trendlines  ,  double top  on a lower time frame,  rsi  divergence,  bearish pin bar  ,  inside bar  break down etc.) (Note #2)  
5.	Stop loss to be set above  double top 
6.	Set Take Profit levels (Note #3)  

Note #1 ( Double top ):  
The first step for the formation of 2618 is to form a  double top  at key resistance levels. Why at key resistance levels? Because we want to avoid fake double tops which can occur occasionally.  

There are some variations between various resources (books, websites) regarding the definitions of “double top”. The main differences occur where:  
a)	Some said for a  double top  to be valid, the wick of the 2nd top cannot exceed the wick of the 1st top; whereas, others said:  
b)	The wick of the 2nd top can exceed the wick of the 1st top but the candle close of the 2nd top CANNOT exceed the wick of the 1st top; or  
c)	The wick of the 2nd top can exceed the wick of the 1st top and the candle close of the 2nd top CAN exceed the wick of the 1st top; or  
d)	The wick of the 2nd top meets at least the candle close of the 1st top; or  
e)	The body of the 2nd top cannot exceed the body of the 1st top  

Personally, I would say all the above definitions work just fine although I do prefer definition a) because it means that the selling pressure is strong and the bulls fail to make a higher high. When there is a higher high formed in a downtrend, it can mean the downtrend has reversed and therefore you might not want to sell when the price pulls back to the 0.618 fib retracement.  

Note #2 ( 0.618 retracement ):  
When the price pulls back to 0.618, it does not mean to sell straight away. There must be more than one reason to sell other than the 0.618 retrace. The more reasons the better. In this example, you can see there are certainly structures (key resistance levels) at the 0.618 retrace. As well, there was a  double top  formed on the lower time frame. Consequently, you can sell.  

After  BTC -0.95%  hit the 0.618 retrace the first time, the price dropped from $9735 to $8650. but quickly bounced back to the 0.618 retrace level. That was a second & better opportunity to sell. Not only did  BTC -0.95%  form a  double top  on the larger time frame, but also with a  bearish  divergence on the 4hr time frame. Accordingly, you have more reasons to sell.  

Note #3 (Set take profit)  
Same as the rules of “Double top”, there are some variations as to which price level should you take profits. Personally, I would stick to the below:  
1)	First, take profit when risk/reward ratio hits 1:1 (recommend to take 30% - 50% profits and adjust the SL of the remaining positions to break-even)  
2)	When price hits the same price level as the low after the neckline is broken ((b) point in this example)  
3)	When price hits 1.272 fib extension of (a)(b)  
4)	When price hits point (d) (using  AB=CD  pattern. If you are not sure what the rules of  AB=CD  are, you can refer to my previous TA in which I have attached the link below)  
5)	If in a one-way market (heavily bearish/bullish), you can always keep 10% to 20% of your positions and take profits when risk/reward ratio hits 1:5 or even 1:10

 BTC -0.95%  is on the verge of breaking to a daily higher high on the bounce if the bulls can see a push this morning. 
If we reject from here the daily will form a lower high and we will see a tightening pattern within the highlighted  support and resistance  lines.  
Important for the bulls to show up or we could stay in this range into tomorrow.  
Healthy consolidation after the most recent bull move and the 15 min chart needs to change the trend.  
Also look to  EMA  12 support on the 4 hour and hourly.  
Another morning like yesterday with the bulls comfortable as worst case, we likely stay in the tightening pattern if bulls cannot prove themselves.

The current situation of  Bitcoin -0.95%  is quite difficult. We are on a clear treshold. A lot of traders are saying that we are on a clear downtrend, but the same amount of people are claiming that we will have our reversal soon. 

This article tries to sum up all important information you have to need! 

1: Retracement of a parabolic uptrend: 
There is a rule of thumb for the retracement of a parabolic uptrend. We should retrace to approx. the 0.786  Fibonacci Retracement  +/- 10%! 
Depending where we start the count, we are already in that target. Although both ways (blue and red) have still some space for a further downwave! 







2: The bloody support of Bitcoin: 
The average cost of mining one  bitcoin -0.95%  are at USA/Russia approx. 4700$ and at 3100$ for china! 
A drop below a target of 4700$ would be savage. Nevertheless, i can't image that we will hit that target. 







3: Manipulation of  Bitcoin -0.95%  and the Bart Simpson Pattern: 
A friend of mine found some unusual patterns in the orderbooks of several exchanges: 
https://twitter.com/CryptoSyndrome 
Altcoins are manipulated on a daily basis. It seems that  bitcoin -0.95%  is now affected to this too, which causes all these 3-5% pump and dumps. 
Thus, we are forming all the time the Bartin Simpsons Patterns. 

4: Similarity to 2014: 
Bitcoin -0.95%  now: 






Bitcoin -0.95%  2014: 







5: Deminishing downtrend and a strong support 
If we see the falling  wedges  as the force of the downtrend, then the force is diminishing! 
Furthermore we have strong support which is holding now for the 4th time! 







6: The Indicators 
Having a look at the indicators at 2D, we have a good potential for an upwave now. 
The  volume  is deminishing which should indicate a breakout soon. 
The  MACD  is about to cross, the  RSI  was slightly overbought and is heading up like the  Stoch .  RSI . 
The 200  EMA  is slighty under the current price and act as a support. 

7: The symetrical Triangle 
The theory says, that we should have in a  sym -1.72% . triangle 5 times an  ABC  wave. The waves are not perfect, but we can construct them. 






As you can see, the last four ABC-Waves formed always a 1:1 extention, which indicates that we have finished wave 5. 

8: A possible Head and Shoulders 
Even if this is not the most perfect  Head and Shoulders  Pattern, it's still valid! 
We are currently at the neckline, which is a strong and important resistance. Breaking upwards should indicate a good uptrend. 







9: The magic  6th 0.00%  of the month 






Suprisingly we have on every  6th 0.00%  of the month a reversal. Why is that??? 
One reason could be the  CME Group Futures  with dates for the settlements always nearby the  6th 0.00%  of the month! 
http://www.cmegroup.com 

10: Longterm  Bullish  TA 
The whole pattern could be seen as a big  bullish pennant . 







11: Shortterm  Bullish  TA 
Leading diagonal  starting wave1 of an  Elliott Wave , since we have now an impulse wave, after the 5x  ABC  pattern inside the triangle is finished. 
Our target should be at the top of the triangle nearby 8600-8800$. 







12: Longterm  Bearish  TA 
We also can argue, that we are currenty in an downtrend and the  sym -1.72% . triangle just continuing the trend. 
Our target should be nearby 6000$ which is also a finished downwards  Elliott Wave .

Nothing is happening in the market:  volatility  has become extinct and coins' trading fallen out of fashion. Range-bound bots and robotic humans absolutely prosper in this environment. The price was unable to break the 7700 threshold. For me this is a  bearish  signal. Indicators provide mixed signals, so let's examine wave structure. The move from May 29 is a  3-wave -0.12%  correction within a larger downtrend. A price drop below 7500 would confirm this scenario.

					Impulse Wave Truncation (Truncated Fifth) - 
Truncated 5th wave is when the market has become so over-extended in Wave 3 that there is not much force left for the impulse wave to come to a proper completion. So when this happens, there is a chance that the last wave of the impulse, Wave 5, will not reach the end of Wave 3 before the market starts correcting in the opposite direction. At this point, the market is just too exhausted. This condition is often called a “failure” or a “Truncation.”

I can see many people still believe that we are going inside a  descending triangle . I also believed this in my idea that i shard on may 1st: 



 

Things can change so quickly and if we didn't adapt to the changes then someone will. That's why i believe that we have to be in fast adapt mode in this market. Doesn't mean that you need to change without checking yourself. I try to find 2-3 confirmations before i change my idea on something. This includes pattern changes, trend changes etc 

There are 21 corrective wave patterns in EW which is categorized into major 3 corrective wave patterns: 

Zigzag  (5-3-5) 
Flat (3-3-5) 
Triangle (3-3-3-3-3) 

And other patterns are combinations of the above which is:  

Double three (A combination of two corrective patterns above) 
Triple three (A combination of three corrective patterns above) 

So what i can see now is that we are in two double three combination corrective wave pattern:

Confirmations: 

1. Wave ((i)) of C is 1.6k and ((v)) is going to be completed below the triangle 
2. Wave (E) of the triangle can't go beyond the triangle.  
3. This has happened twice before in 2013 & 2015 

Each wave  got 3 subwaves (a,b &c) inside and we are in the subwave c of ((y)) of Y which is an impulsive wave. 

Impulsive waves: 1,3,5,a,c 
Corrective waves: 2,4,b 

Normal Fibo Ratios for these waves are: 

wave 2 = 0.5 - 0.8 of wave 1  
wave 3 = 1.236 - 1.618 of wave 1  
wave 4 = 0.5 - 0.618 of wave 3  
wave 5 = 0.618 - 1 of wave 1  
wave B = 0.5 - 0.8 of wave A  
wave C = 0.618 - 1.236 of wave A  

Now if you check what happened in subwave a of ((y)) of Y you can see that: 

Wave (i) of a: 985$ 
Wave (ii) of a: 434$  
Wave ( iii -0.64% ) of a: 1207$  
Wave (iv) of a: 691$ [~0.618 of Wave ( iii -0.64% )] 
Wave (v) of a: 950$  








I have seen  BTC -0.95%  impulsive waves fibo ratios almost the same as the previous impulsive wave fibo ratios. 
Now if you apply the same for the last wave C of (E) this is what you get: 

Wave ((i)) of c: 1587$ 
Wave ((ii)) of c  = 793$ 
Wave (( iii -0.64% )) of c  = 1961$ 
Wave ((iv)) of c [~0.618 of Wave (( iii -0.64% ))] = 1212$ 
Wave ((v)) of c  = 1587$ 








Also note that Wave ((iv)) might not retrace upto 0.618 of Wave (( iii -0.64% )) as everyone will be in panic mode by that time so minimum retracement would be around 0.386 of Wave (( iii -0.64% )) which is around 756$ and this is why i can see it goes down to 5k level or little bit more towards 4.7k which is the lowest level of the  support zone  (orange dotted lines) 








So 3 Possible Support lines for reversal would be 

1. Blue: 5800 - 6100 (Only possible if Wave ((v)) is truncated) 
2. Orange: 4700 - 5000 (This is most likely where we heading)  
3. Red: 4100 - 4400 (Only possible if Wave (( iii -0.64% )) is extended)

 Bitcoin -0.95%  has recently developed an interesting pattern of completing a  bullish  and  bearish  cycle on the sixth of every month in an alternating order. As we can see in the chart above, a fall is followed by a rise. This has happened twice before and is expected to happen again now on the  6th 0.00%  of June, 2018. This time  Bitcoin -0.95%  will finish a  bearish  cycle and I expected to begin the next  bullish  cycle at least till the end of  6th 0.00%  of July, 2018. 

This pattern of rise and fall is also supported by other patterns on the chart that signal a  bullish  reversal. The support line has also held firmly and if this pattern of alternating rise and fall ensues,  Bitcoin -0.95%  could very well make new highs by the end of the year. The  RSI  is recovering from oversold levels and has now approached a normal.  Bitcoin -0.95%  is currently at a favorable point for  bullish  entries. The price broke a long term resistance as it break past the downtrend line in April, 2018. This was a big accomplishment for the bulls but the lack of confidence pulled the price back to the support line. Currently, the price is just above the support line and appears to be all set for a  bullish  comeback but the reality is, there are not enough bulls in the market. 

The past few months have been devastating for the price of  Bitcoin -0.95%  ( BTC -0.95% ) and a lot of investors are still running scared. Institutional investors are looking for more clarity regarding regulations concerning cryptocurrencies and also safer ways to invest and store their coins. As for retail investors, most of them comprise of first time investors who have never traded any financial asset before. So, when they saw that  Bitcoin -0.95%  ( BTC -0.95% ) is making 20% gains every day, they thought this could go on forever and jumped with both feet, only to find the carpet pulled under from their feet. Big investors have always played small investors as cannon fodder and have gotten away with their schemes even in regulated markets like forex or the stock market. Cryptocurrencies is a new market with no proper regulations which means it is natural to expect that those who can afford to not play by the rules, most likely won’t.

Hello friends,  

It's been a while since my last post; lack of time and an urge to do more research has mainly driven me to take a break from posting ideas on TradingView. I am still in the process of doing more research and study, but I figure posting once in a while couldn't hurt. 

Since I have become recently very convinced about this, I am outlining a very possible situation with  Bitcoin -0.95%  where the  trend line  we have been on since early October breaks, reaching around a temporary low of $5000. This is examined on the  daily chart , since this is one of the best charts to examine trends of this size. I have to first and foremost say that I am not trying to spread fear, I know many people do not like to hear  bearish  ideas, but  technical analysis  is ultimately a rational exercise, and I feel that possibilities with very strong signs should be explored. 

There are a few things to look at, but I first want to talk about the big picture with, long-term  support and resistance  lines. I think most people can agree that there was a very significant downtrending resistance line that began from the peak of the  ATH 0.63%  in late December, to the low of around $6400 (thick red line). After the break from that line, it seems we moved into a sideways trend, bouncing back and forth between an emerging downtrending resistance line (light red) and a support line that we seem to have been respecting since mid-October (light green); at least this appears to be the case with the lows, where the angle's effectiveness appears very strongly. Finally, based on previous bounces, we can establish a support of around $5000-$5300 (I've thus created a small  support zone  around that range, in dark green), as well as lower supports around $3200 and $2000 (though I do not believe these will be reached, in dark green).   

Now, onto the analysis - it's no secret that  Bitcoin -0.95%  has been squeezing in, ready for a significant move either upwards or downwards. Initially I considered the upwards move to be more likely due to the significant media attention cryptocurrency has been receiving, but after viewing previous market cycles of  Bitcoin -0.95%  (check 2013), it seems clear to me that the  bearish  scenario of closing in on the market cycle is very likely, and should at the very least be prepared for with proper risk management. According to Dow Theory, which is said to have laid the foundations of modern  technical analysis , history repeats itself, and this is a situation where we forced to consider this. 

Should we break from the line, we will likely fall straight down to the $5000-$5000 area, where we will shoot back up and bounce towards around $6700 or so (maybe a little less). From there one, we will likely enter a sideways trend, which we will continue until we see higher highs and higher lows and parabolic movement returns, which could lead to us challenging the all-time high, and hitting $35k-$50k. 

NOTE: I seem to have reached the max character limit for this section of the idea, so I will continue my text below.

Comment:
					Onto the short-term: 


Scenario A: 

The reason why I have drawn this movement into a pennant is this way, is simply because we have been moving through this ascending triangle for quite a while now (May 23rd to today). I don't think that the pattern will be sufficient to directly lead into a strong sell-off, but we should consider that the size of ascending triangle suggests a small movement downwards at the very least, which can create a higher low, and thus move into position into a bearish pennant. Why would a bearish pennant occur here and not have a bounce to $8500-$8700? The reason is in positioning - the huge downtrend (May 5th to May 26th) creates a very nice flagpole in which it hits around the $5000 area very perfectly, and thus I would not be surprised if this happens. 

Second reason: on the Stoch RSI indicator on the daily chart, it appears to be dangerously high, which would suggest it being oversold. For the most part, it seems to have called lows and highs, at least to some extent. This overdrawn movement may very well have increased the likelyhood of Bitcoin being oversold. This could suggest that this is the last step into a sharp downturn, but this does not preclude Situation B. Volume has also been steadily decreasing, but this is the case with any sort of consolidation, I believe. 

Finally, the lines I have drawn below the triangle are simply bounces that I think seem fairly reasonable. The length from to support to the lines correlate with the length of the flagpole, of course, though it may seem chopped off due to the huge line from the long-term support downwards. 


Scenario B: 

This is much simpler, Bitcoin hits the upper resistance line, bounces off, challenges the lower support line, and we potentially see a break, and the rest unfolds from there. 


----------------------------------------------------------------------- 


With all this being said, do not fear if you are hoping for more parabolic movement - this likely will not be the end, and will simply be the set up for a long, drawn out sideways movement until the first signs of bullish activity begin and we start all over again. If you are longing around here, please consider using risk management, prepare for every possibility. If you are shorting, the same applies. 

Please trade with care. I wish the best to all traders!

Comment:
					This really is a very minor note, but I just want to emphasize that the rising wedge (which I erroneously refer to as an ascending triangle, a bad habit I have) entering a bearish pennant is more based on intuition than anything. Also, this pennant is mainly based on the conservative assumption that the break will happen at 7900, if it happens at 7700 where we seem to be general resistance, the pennant would look something like this:

I am Mid term-bullish on  BTC -0.95%  going into the end of this week, but looking to get into the market on a pull back to occur before I get in to the market.  The jury is still out as to whether this weekly bear trend is ready to turn around.  

We can see that both the  RSI  and  MFI  are both  Bullish  on the daily having bottomed when reaching oversold on both at c. $7k support where we found our longer term  trend line . 

We are currently in the process of meeting the Tenkan (blue line) as I write this, so in the very short term, I am looking for a pull back to $7550 range for an entry.  One of the main reasons for this is that on the 4hour timeframes we are close to completing an edge to edge trade so the risk reward doesn’t fit my profile, however a break out from the cloud or above the Tenkan around $7777 will make me enter the market. 

The  RSI  and  MFI  have both been excellent indicators in this bear market.  Whenever  RSI  has gone above the 60 and the  MFI  80; its time to exit the market from a  bullish  trade and consider shorting as it progresses higher.   

Based on the  RSI ,  MFI  trends and the fact that we will run into the Kijun at just around $8-8.2k, I will be scalling out at this  bearish  confluence level to start looking for pull backs and reassessment as i believe it to be a key point as  

Best case scenario this trade would yield a 10% return before leverage. 
This is for illustrative purposes only, please DYOR and goodluck with your trading.

So the pullback trade that we were looking at worked out & has made it's way back to the neckline level of structure. We are now at what i like to call a ""decision point"" Essentially IF price is able to violate this current level od structure THEN we're likely to continue to our next price projection.  

Something that a lot of newer traders don't understand is that when it comes to bigger moves, the market will often provide multiple opportunities to get involved. For those who don't rush and for those who don't get discouraged. If you perform consistent analysis you can often find multiple ways to involve yourself in a trade even if you missed the first strike.

Recent price action has clear signs of wash trading / market manipulation fud and lots of nonsense. Its hard to prove almost impossible so as a trader we just need to deal with it. Ideally the situation you are supposed to trade are critical break up and break down points to enter the trade. Dont enter or exit dumb trades and lose money.

I am never good with words so instead of writing paragraphs of clarification to justify my call for SHORT since my last posting, I have explained everything on my chart with the least words possible using Fibonacci. It does not matter how popular  Bitcoin -0.95%  has become, or how deep it has disrupted the financial sector, or how many institutional investors have come to invest in it -- the psychology behind a market cycle does not change. 

I don't really encourage anyone to short  Bitcoin -0.95% , but in all honesty, don't expect the bulls to fly anytime soon. Like I said before, this correction that we are having right now is the ""MOTHER OF ALL CORRECTIONS"" after a 4-year-long bull cycle since the 2013 correction... and we are just halfway through.

My best idea ever, taking some time off the last 2 days :) The whales just continue to play their little games by squeezing leveraged short and long positions out of the market. Can't play them, it's just too easy. Maybe it's time we retail traders stand together, combine our  volume  and use their own game against them. Yeah, maybe we could even make a blockbuster movie about this :) I love me some science fiction :) LOL  

My last update of the previous analysis i showed 2 important support levels where the price could bounce up from. The first support around 7350 did the trick and the price got pushed back to 7700. From that point on i told my members that i thought i was seeing distribution, but it was still very confusing to figure out what was going on. TA was showing  bullish  signs, that  bull flag  was very strong and was even turning slowly up and was about to squeeze upwards. But of course out of no where the price got dumped, the move we saw a few hours ago. After that 200 point drop the price got pushed up again to 7700 like that dump was a glitch. If your a whale, why not push out leveraged traders and take your money while your accumulating or distributing. It's like a bonus, like the cherry on top :)  

Anyway, in this chart we can see allot of similarities of what is going on. As you know i have been saying i am still  bearish  for the medium term, but i just could not say what was going to happen on the short term. 2 days ago after we finally dropped out of that  wedge , i said we would have 2 options.  
- Break those 2 support levels from the last update of my previous chart (73xx and 71xx) 
- Make a higher low at those same support levels and make another move up above the high.  
 
As we can see in the chart, the  fractal  is not 100% identical so it's no guarantee that the 7700 high we just saw is the high already and that we start to move down. But based on this  fractal , i don't want to see the price get above the 7800/7900. This  fractal  confirms my  bearish  view as well. That's why TA is so great, you can turn any chart to fit your view :). 

Even without this  fractal , i just give it a very small chance that 7K price action is the fundament of a low to start another bull rally, i just highly doubt that. I want to see more  volume  to begin with and at least  double bottom  kind of formation. So the minimum i expect is a test of the 7100/6900in the coming week or 2. But the movement i have in mind for the med term is a drop below the 7K to form a big V shape low. If we get to see that, than i might even become  bullish  for the rest of the year :).  

As long as the price stays above the 73xx, we have to assume the bulls are still in control and we should see another wave up. So for me the 73xx is an important turning point.

					This is my bigger picture, think this bearish triangle is still 100% in play. I think if bulls can't break the 7800/7900 the bearish version is probably going to happen. Can't say HOW it will go, this blue line is just a guess. But a big V shape low would be the most bullish for the long term. I still think we are seeing distribution here. The only way this idea can be countered, is through a big increase of buying volume, if that doesn't happen, i think it's only a matter of time.

The price took a small dump but the volume was low so no real read on what the intent was. So we might see another move up, if we start to see a small pump that takes out the 7800, be aware of a fake breakout. The blue line is a possibility of what the move could look like IF we move up and if the breakout fails. If that happens than we will probably get confirmation if the price breaks the 7600ish. If we break the 7800 it should stay above the 7700 to confirm another move up. Not much more to say about what's going on.

91,1528359434.0,Taiwan_Bear,2618 (Double top & 0.618 pull-back) - do not miss it!!,"
In the last couple of TAs I have mentioned the “2618 pattern” and have been asked what 2618 means. Sorry for taking it so long as it took me quite a while to put everything altogether. But, as promised, I have explained below the rules and trade setups for the 2618 pattern.  

What are the rules/setups/steps for 2618?  
1.	Form a  double top  (Note #1)  
2.	Neckline has to be broken  
3.	After price found support at point (b), wait for pull back to 0.618 fib retracement of (a)(b)  
4.	After price retraced to 0.618, look for confluence and sell (eg. Structures,  trendlines  ,  double top  on a lower time frame,  rsi  divergence,  bearish pin bar  ,  inside bar  break down etc.) (Note #2)  
5.	Stop loss to be set above  double top 
6.	Set Take Profit levels (Note #3)  

Note #1 ( Double top ):  
The first step for the formation of 2618 is to form a  double top  at key resistance levels. Why at key resistance levels? Because we want to avoid fake double tops which can occur occasionally.  

There are some variations between various resources (books, websites) regarding the definitions of “double top”. The main differences occur where:  
a)	Some said for a  double top  to be valid, the wick of the 2nd top cannot exceed the wick of the 1st top; whereas, others said:  
b)	The wick of the 2nd top can exceed the wick of the 1st top but the candle close of the 2nd top CANNOT exceed the wick of the 1st top; or  
c)	The wick of the 2nd top can exceed the wick of the 1st top and the candle close of the 2nd top CAN exceed the wick of the 1st top; or  
d)	The wick of the 2nd top meets at least the candle close of the 1st top; or  
e)	The body of the 2nd top cannot exceed the body of the 1st top  

Personally, I would say all the above definitions work just fine although I do prefer definition a) because it means that the selling pressure is strong and the bulls fail to make a higher high. When there is a higher high formed in a downtrend, it can mean the downtrend has reversed and therefore you might not want to sell when the price pulls back to the 0.618 fib retracement.  

Note #2 ( 0.618 retracement ):  
When the price pulls back to 0.618, it does not mean to sell straight away. There must be more than one reason to sell other than the 0.618 retrace. The more reasons the better. In this example, you can see there are certainly structures (key resistance levels) at the 0.618 retrace. As well, there was a  double top  formed on the lower time frame. Consequently, you can sell.  

After  BTC -0.95%  hit the 0.618 retrace the first time, the price dropped from $9735 to $8650. but quickly bounced back to the 0.618 retrace level. That was a second & better opportunity to sell. Not only did  BTC -0.95%  form a  double top  on the larger time frame, but also with a  bearish  divergence on the 4hr time frame. Accordingly, you have more reasons to sell.  

Note #3 (Set take profit)  
Same as the rules of “Double top”, there are some variations as to which price level should you take profits. Personally, I would stick to the below:  
1)	First, take profit when risk/reward ratio hits 1:1 (recommend to take 30% - 50% profits and adjust the SL of the remaining positions to break-even)

 BTC -0.95%  is on the verge of breaking to a daily higher high on the bounce if the bulls can see a push this morning. 
If we reject from here the daily will form a lower high and we will see a tightening pattern within the highlighted  support and resistance  lines.  
Important for the bulls to show up or we could stay in this range into tomorrow.  
Healthy consolidation after the most recent bull move and the 15 min chart needs to change the trend.  
Also look to  EMA  12 support on the 4 hour and hourly.  
Another morning like yesterday with the bulls comfortable as worst case, we likely stay in the tightening pattern if bulls cannot prove themselves.

The current situation of  Bitcoin -0.95%  is quite difficult. We are on a clear treshold. A lot of traders are saying that we are on a clear downtrend, but the same amount of people are claiming that we will have our reversal soon. 

This article tries to sum up all important information you have to need! 

1: Retracement of a parabolic uptrend: 
There is a rule of thumb for the retracement of a parabolic uptrend. We should retrace to approx. the 0.786  Fibonacci Retracement  +/- 10%! 
Depending where we start the count, we are already in that target. Although both ways (blue and red) have still some space for a further downwave! 







2: The bloody support of Bitcoin: 
The average cost of mining one  bitcoin -0.95%  are at USA/Russia approx. 4700$ and at 3100$ for china! 
A drop below a target of 4700$ would be savage. Nevertheless, i can't image that we will hit that target. 







3: Manipulation of  Bitcoin -0.95%  and the Bart Simpson Pattern: 
A friend of mine found some unusual patterns in the orderbooks of several exchanges: 
https://twitter.com/CryptoSyndrome 
Altcoins are manipulated on a daily basis. It seems that  bitcoin -0.95%  is now affected to this too, which causes all these 3-5% pump and dumps. 
Thus, we are forming all the time the Bartin Simpsons Patterns. 

4: Similarity to 2014: 
Bitcoin -0.95%  now: 






Bitcoin -0.95%  2014: 







5: Deminishing downtrend and a strong support 
If we see the falling  wedges  as the force of the downtrend, then the force is diminishing! 
Furthermore we have strong support which is holding now for the 4th time! 







6: The Indicators 
Having a look at the indicators at 2D, we have a good potential for an upwave now. 
The  volume  is deminishing which should indicate a breakout soon. 
The  MACD  is about to cross, the  RSI  was slightly overbought and is heading up like the  Stoch .  RSI . 
The 200  EMA  is slighty under the current price and act as a support. 

7: The symetrical Triangle 
The theory says, that we should have in a  sym -1.72% . triangle 5 times an  ABC  wave. The waves are not perfect, but we can construct them. 






As you can see, the last four ABC-Waves formed always a 1:1 extention, which indicates that we have finished wave 5. 

8: A possible Head and Shoulders 
Even if this is not the most perfect  Head and Shoulders  Pattern, it's still valid! 
We are currently at the neckline, which is a strong and important resistance. Breaking upwards should indicate a good uptrend. 







9: The magic  6th 0.00%  of the month 






Suprisingly we have on every  6th 0.00%  of the month a reversal. Why is that??? 
One reason could be the  CME Group Futures  with dates for the settlements always nearby the  6th 0.00%  of the month! 
http://www.cmegroup.com 

10: Longterm  Bullish  TA 
The whole pattern could be seen as a big  bullish pennant . 







11: Shortterm  Bullish  TA 
Leading diagonal  starting wave1 of an  Elliott Wave , since we have now an impulse wave, after the 5x  ABC  pattern inside the triangle is finished. 
Our target should be at the top of the triangle nearby 8600-8800$. 







12: Longterm  Bearish  TA 
We also can argue, that we are currenty in an downtrend and the  sym -1.72% . triangle just continuing the trend. 
Our target should be nearby 6000$ which is also a finished downwards  Elliott Wave .

Nothing is happening in the market:  volatility  has become extinct and coins' trading fallen out of fashion. Range-bound bots and robotic humans absolutely prosper in this environment. The price was unable to break the 7700 threshold. For me this is a  bearish  signal. Indicators provide mixed signals, so let's examine wave structure. The move from May 29 is a  3-wave -0.12%  correction within a larger downtrend. A price drop below 7500 would confirm this scenario.

					Impulse Wave Truncation (Truncated Fifth) - 
Truncated 5th wave is when the market has become so over-extended in Wave 3 that there is not much force left for the impulse wave to come to a proper completion. So when this happens, there is a chance that the last wave of the impulse, Wave 5, will not reach the end of Wave 3 before the market starts correcting in the opposite direction. At this point, the market is just too exhausted. This condition is often called a “failure” or a “Truncation.”

I can see many people still believe that we are going inside a  descending triangle . I also believed this in my idea that i shard on may 1st: 



 

Things can change so quickly and if we didn't adapt to the changes then someone will. That's why i believe that we have to be in fast adapt mode in this market. Doesn't mean that you need to change without checking yourself. I try to find 2-3 confirmations before i change my idea on something. This includes pattern changes, trend changes etc 

There are 21 corrective wave patterns in EW which is categorized into major 3 corrective wave patterns: 

Zigzag  (5-3-5) 
Flat (3-3-5) 
Triangle (3-3-3-3-3) 

And other patterns are combinations of the above which is:  

Double three (A combination of two corrective patterns above) 
Triple three (A combination of three corrective patterns above) 

So what i can see now is that we are in two double three combination corrective wave pattern: 








More info here:  

https://elliottwave-forecast.com/elliott-wave-theory/#corrective-waves 

Confirmations: 

1. Wave ((i)) of C is 1.6k and ((v)) is going to be completed below the triangle 
2. Wave (E) of the triangle can't go beyond the triangle.  
3. This has happened twice before in 2013 & 2015 

Each wave  got 3 subwaves (a,b &c) inside and we are in the subwave c of ((y)) of Y which is an impulsive wave. 

Impulsive waves: 1,3,5,a,c 
Corrective waves: 2,4,b 

Normal Fibo Ratios for these waves are: 

wave 2 = 0.5 - 0.8 of wave 1  
wave 3 = 1.236 - 1.618 of wave 1  
wave 4 = 0.5 - 0.618 of wave 3  
wave 5 = 0.618 - 1 of wave 1  
wave B = 0.5 - 0.8 of wave A  
wave C = 0.618 - 1.236 of wave A  

Now if you check what happened in subwave a of ((y)) of Y you can see that: 

Wave (i) of a: 985$ 
Wave (ii) of a: 434$  
Wave ( iii -0.65% ) of a: 1207$  
Wave (iv) of a: 691$ [~0.618 of Wave ( iii -0.65% )] 
Wave (v) of a: 950$  








I have seen  BTC -0.97%  impulsive waves fibo ratios almost the same as the previous impulsive wave fibo ratios. 
Now if you apply the same for the last wave C of (E) this is what you get: 

Wave ((i)) of c: 1587$ 
Wave ((ii)) of c  = 793$ 
Wave (( iii -0.65% )) of c  = 1961$ 
Wave ((iv)) of c [~0.618 of Wave (( iii -0.65% ))] = 1212$ 
Wave ((v)) of c  = 1587$ 








Also note that Wave ((iv)) might not retrace upto 0.618 of Wave (( iii -0.65% )) as everyone will be in panic mode by that time so minimum retracement would be around 0.386 of Wave (( iii -0.65% )) which is around 756$ and this is why i can see it goes down to 5k level or little bit more towards 4.7k which is the lowest level of the  support zone  (orange dotted lines) 








So 3 Possible Support lines for reversal would be 

1. Blue: 5800 - 6100 (Only possible if Wave ((v)) is truncated) 
2. Orange: 4700 - 5000 (This is most likely where we heading)  
3. Red: 4100 - 4400 (Only possible if Wave (( iii -0.65% )) is extended)

 Bitcoin -0.97%  has recently developed an interesting pattern of completing a  bullish  and  bearish  cycle on the sixth of every month in an alternating order. As we can see in the chart above, a fall is followed by a rise. This has happened twice before and is expected to happen again now on the  6th 0.00%  of June, 2018. This time  Bitcoin -0.97%  will finish a  bearish  cycle and I expected to begin the next  bullish  cycle at least till the end of  6th 0.00%  of July, 2018. 

This pattern of rise and fall is also supported by other patterns on the chart that signal a  bullish  reversal. The support line has also held firmly and if this pattern of alternating rise and fall ensues,  Bitcoin -0.97%  could very well make new highs by the end of the year. The  RSI  is recovering from oversold levels and has now approached a normal.  Bitcoin -0.97%  is currently at a favorable point for  bullish  entries. The price broke a long term resistance as it break past the downtrend line in April, 2018. This was a big accomplishment for the bulls but the lack of confidence pulled the price back to the support line. Currently, the price is just above the support line and appears to be all set for a  bullish  comeback but the reality is, there are not enough bulls in the market. 

The past few months have been devastating for the price of  Bitcoin -0.97%  ( BTC -0.97% ) and a lot of investors are still running scared. Institutional investors are looking for more clarity regarding regulations concerning cryptocurrencies and also safer ways to invest and store their coins. As for retail investors, most of them comprise of first time investors who have never traded any financial asset before. So, when they saw that  Bitcoin -0.97%  ( BTC -0.97% ) is making 20% gains every day, they thought this could go on forever and jumped with both feet, only to find the carpet pulled under from their feet. Big investors have always played small investors as cannon fodder and have gotten away with their schemes even in regulated markets like forex or the stock market. Cryptocurrencies is a new market with no proper regulations which means it is natural to expect that those who can afford to not play by the rules, most likely won’t.

Hello friends,  

It's been a while since my last post; lack of time and an urge to do more research has mainly driven me to take a break from posting ideas on TradingView. I am still in the process of doing more research and study, but I figure posting once in a while couldn't hurt. 

Since I have become recently very convinced about this, I am outlining a very possible situation with  Bitcoin -0.97%  where the  trend line  we have been on since early October breaks, reaching around a temporary low of $5000. This is examined on the  daily chart , since this is one of the best charts to examine trends of this size. I have to first and foremost say that I am not trying to spread fear, I know many people do not like to hear  bearish  ideas, but  technical analysis  is ultimately a rational exercise, and I feel that possibilities with very strong signs should be explored. 

There are a few things to look at, but I first want to talk about the big picture with, long-term  support and resistance  lines. I think most people can agree that there was a very significant downtrending resistance line that began from the peak of the  ATH 0.63%  in late December, to the low of around $6400 (thick red line). After the break from that line, it seems we moved into a sideways trend, bouncing back and forth between an emerging downtrending resistance line (light red) and a support line that we seem to have been respecting since mid-October (light green); at least this appears to be the case with the lows, where the angle's effectiveness appears very strongly. Finally, based on previous bounces, we can establish a support of around $5000-$5300 (I've thus created a small  support zone  around that range, in dark green), as well as lower supports around $3200 and $2000 (though I do not believe these will be reached, in dark green).   

Now, onto the analysis - it's no secret that  Bitcoin -0.97%  has been squeezing in, ready for a significant move either upwards or downwards. Initially I considered the upwards move to be more likely due to the significant media attention cryptocurrency has been receiving, but after viewing previous market cycles of  Bitcoin -0.97%  (check 2013), it seems clear to me that the  bearish  scenario of closing in on the market cycle is very likely, and should at the very least be prepared for with proper risk management. According to Dow Theory, which is said to have laid the foundations of modern  technical analysis , history repeats itself, and this is a situation where we forced to consider this. 

Should we break from the line, we will likely fall straight down to the $5000-$5000 area, where we will shoot back up and bounce towards around $6700 or so (maybe a little less). From there one, we will likely enter a sideways trend, which we will continue until we see higher highs and higher lows and parabolic movement returns, which could lead to us challenging the all-time high, and hitting $35k-$50k. 

NOTE: I seem to have reached the max character limit for this section of the idea, so I will continue my text below.

Comment:
					Onto the short-term: 


Scenario A: 

The reason why I have drawn this movement into a pennant is this way, is simply because we have been moving through this ascending triangle for quite a while now (May 23rd to today). I don't think that the pattern will be sufficient to directly lead into a strong sell-off, but we should consider that the size of ascending triangle suggests a small movement downwards at the very least, which can create a higher low, and thus move into position into a bearish pennant. Why would a bearish pennant occur here and not have a bounce to $8500-$8700? The reason is in positioning - the huge downtrend (May 5th to May 26th) creates a very nice flagpole in which it hits around the $5000 area very perfectly, and thus I would not be surprised if this happens. 

Second reason: on the Stoch RSI indicator on the daily chart, it appears to be dangerously high, which would suggest it being oversold. For the most part, it seems to have called lows and highs, at least to some extent. This overdrawn movement may very well have increased the likelyhood of Bitcoin being oversold. This could suggest that this is the last step into a sharp downturn, but this does not preclude Situation B. Volume has also been steadily decreasing, but this is the case with any sort of consolidation, I believe. 

Finally, the lines I have drawn below the triangle are simply bounces that I think seem fairly reasonable. The length from to support to the lines correlate with the length of the flagpole, of course, though it may seem chopped off due to the huge line from the long-term support downwards. 


Scenario B: 

This is much simpler, Bitcoin hits the upper resistance line, bounces off, challenges the lower support line, and we potentially see a break, and the rest unfolds from there. 


----------------------------------------------------------------------- 


With all this being said, do not fear if you are hoping for more parabolic movement - this likely will not be the end, and will simply be the set up for a long, drawn out sideways movement until the first signs of bullish activity begin and we start all over again. If you are longing around here, please consider using risk management, prepare for every possibility. If you are shorting, the same applies. 

Please trade with care. I wish the best to all traders!

Comment:
					This really is a very minor note, but I just want to emphasize that the rising wedge (which I erroneously refer to as an ascending triangle, a bad habit I have) entering a bearish pennant is more based on intuition than anything. Also, this pennant is mainly based on the conservative assumption that the break will happen at 7900, if it happens at 7700 where we seem to be general resistance, the pennant would look something like this:

Jun 7




I am Mid term-bullish on  BTC -0.97%  going into the end of this week, but looking to get into the market on a pull back to occur before I get in to the market.  The jury is still out as to whether this weekly bear trend is ready to turn around.  

We can see that both the  RSI  and  MFI  are both  Bullish  on the daily having bottomed when reaching oversold on both at c. $7k support where we found our longer term  trend line . 

We are currently in the process of meeting the Tenkan (blue line) as I write this, so in the very short term, I am looking for a pull back to $7550 range for an entry.  One of the main reasons for this is that on the 4hour timeframes we are close to completing an edge to edge trade so the risk reward doesn’t fit my profile, however a break out from the cloud or above the Tenkan around $7777 will make me enter the market. 

The  RSI  and  MFI  have both been excellent indicators in this bear market.  Whenever  RSI  has gone above the 60 and the  MFI  80; its time to exit the market from a  bullish  trade and consider shorting as it progresses higher.   

Based on the  RSI ,  MFI  trends and the fact that we will run into the Kijun at just around $8-8.2k, I will be scalling out at this  bearish  confluence level to start looking for pull backs and reassessment as i believe it to be a key point as  

Best case scenario this trade would yield a 10% return before leverage. 
This is for illustrative purposes only, please DYOR and goodluck with your trading.

So the pullback trade that we were looking at worked out & has made it's way back to the neckline level of structure. We are now at what i like to call a ""decision point"" Essentially IF price is able to violate this current level od structure THEN we're likely to continue to our next price projection.  

Something that a lot of newer traders don't understand is that when it comes to bigger moves, the market will often provide multiple opportunities to get involved. For those who don't rush and for those who don't get discouraged. If you perform consistent analysis you can often find multiple ways to involve yourself in a trade even if you missed the first strike.

My best idea ever, taking some time off the last 2 days :) The whales just continue to play their little games by squeezing leveraged short and long positions out of the market. Can't play them, it's just too easy. Maybe it's time we retail traders stand together, combine our  volume  and use their own game against them. Yeah, maybe we could even make a blockbuster movie about this :) I love me some science fiction :) LOL  

My last update of the previous analysis i showed 2 important support levels where the price could bounce up from. The first support around 7350 did the trick and the price got pushed back to 7700. From that point on i told my members that i thought i was seeing distribution, but it was still very confusing to figure out what was going on. TA was showing  bullish  signs, that  bull flag  was very strong and was even turning slowly up and was about to squeeze upwards. But of course out of no where the price got dumped, the move we saw a few hours ago. After that 200 point drop the price got pushed up again to 7700 like that dump was a glitch. If your a whale, why not push out leveraged traders and take your money while your accumulating or distributing. It's like a bonus, like the cherry on top :)  

Anyway, in this chart we can see allot of similarities of what is going on. As you know i have been saying i am still  bearish  for the medium term, but i just could not say what was going to happen on the short term. 2 days ago after we finally dropped out of that  wedge , i said we would have 2 options.  
- Break those 2 support levels from the last update of my previous chart (73xx and 71xx) 
- Make a higher low at those same support levels and make another move up above the high.  
 
As we can see in the chart, the  fractal  is not 100% identical so it's no guarantee that the 7700 high we just saw is the high already and that we start to move down. But based on this  fractal , i don't want to see the price get above the 7800/7900. This  fractal  confirms my  bearish  view as well. That's why TA is so great, you can turn any chart to fit your view :). 

Even without this  fractal , i just give it a very small chance that 7K price action is the fundament of a low to start another bull rally, i just highly doubt that. I want to see more  volume  to begin with and at least  double bottom  kind of formation. So the minimum i expect is a test of the 7100/6900in the coming week or 2. But the movement i have in mind for the med term is a drop below the 7K to form a big V shape low. If we get to see that, than i might even become  bullish  for the rest of the year :).  

As long as the price stays above the 73xx, we have to assume the bulls are still in control and we should see another wave up. So for me the 73xx is an important turning point.

Comment:
					At the moment it looks like bulls are trying to push higher, this bull flag/triangle is still very strong. So no sign of weakness yet! First small sign would be a drop below 7620/7600. Bulls need to break 7700

Comment:
					This is my bigger picture, think this bearish triangle is still 100% in play. I think if bulls can't break the 7800/7900 the bearish version is probably going to happen. Can't say HOW it will go, this blue line is just a guess. But a big V shape low would be the most bullish for the long term. I still think we are seeing distribution here. The only way this idea can be countered, is through a big increase of buying volume, if that doesn't happen, i think it's only a matter of time.

					Lower time frame we can see a new upwards channel and maybe even a rising wedge. From the looks of it, it's slowly going down to test the support line again. Depending on what will happen there we can make a better prediction for the rest of the day.

					What a surprise, nothing has changed :) 

The price took a small dump but the volume was low so no real read on what the intent was. So we might see another move up, if we start to see a small pump that takes out the 7800, be aware of a fake breakout. The blue line is a possibility of what the move could look like IF we move up and if the breakout fails. If that happens than we will probably get confirmation if the price breaks the 7600ish. If we break the 7800 it should stay above the 7700 to confirm another move up. Not much more to say about what's going on.

109,1528359434.0,Taiwan_Bear,2618 (Double top & 0.618 pull-back) - do not miss it!!,"
In the last couple of TAs I have mentioned the “2618 pattern” and have been asked what 2618 means. Sorry for taking it so long as it took me quite a while to put everything altogether. But, as promised, I have explained below the rules and trade setups for the 2618 pattern.  

What are the rules/setups/steps for 2618?  
1.	Form a  double top  (Note #1)  
2.	Neckline has to be broken  
3.	After price found support at point (b), wait for pull back to 0.618 fib retracement of (a)(b)  
4.	After price retraced to 0.618, look for confluence and sell (eg. Structures,  trendlines  ,  double top  on a lower time frame,  rsi  divergence,  bearish pin bar  ,  inside bar  break down etc.) (Note #2)  
5.	Stop loss to be set above  double top 
6.	Set Take Profit levels (Note #3)  

Note #1 ( Double top ):  
The first step for the formation of 2618 is to form a  double top  at key resistance levels. Why at key resistance levels? Because we want to avoid fake double tops which can occur occasionally.  

There are some variations between various resources (books, websites) regarding the definitions of “double top”. The main differences occur where:  
a)	Some said for a  double top  to be valid, the wick of the 2nd top cannot exceed the wick of the 1st top; whereas, others said:  
b)	The wick of the 2nd top can exceed the wick of the 1st top but the candle close of the 2nd top CANNOT exceed the wick of the 1st top; or  
c)	The wick of the 2nd top can exceed the wick of the 1st top and the candle close of the 2nd top CAN exceed the wick of the 1st top; or  
d)	The wick of the 2nd top meets at least the candle close of the 1st top; or  
e)	The body of the 2nd top cannot exceed the body of the 1st top  

Personally, I would say all the above definitions work just fine although I do prefer definition a) because it means that the selling pressure is strong and the bulls fail to make a higher high. When there is a higher high formed in a downtrend, it can mean the downtrend has reversed and therefore you might not want to sell when the price pulls back to the 0.618 fib retracement.  

Note #2 ( 0.618 retracement ):  
When the price pulls back to 0.618, it does not mean to sell straight away. There must be more than one reason to sell other than the 0.618 retrace. The more reasons the better. In this example, you can see there are certainly structures (key resistance levels) at the 0.618 retrace. As well, there was a  double top  formed on the lower time frame. Consequently, you can sell.  

After  BTC -1.13%  hit the 0.618 retrace the first time, the price dropped from $9735 to $8650. but quickly bounced back to the 0.618 retrace level. That was a second & better opportunity to sell. Not only did  BTC -1.13%  form a  double top  on the larger time frame, but also with a  bearish  divergence on the 4hr time frame. Accordingly, you have more reasons to sell.  

Note #3 (Set take profit)  
Same as the rules of “Double top”, there are some variations as to which price level should you take profits. Personally, I would stick to the below:  
1)	First, take profit when risk/reward ratio hits 1:1 (recommend to take 30% - 50% profits and adjust the SL of the remaining positions to break-even)  
2)	When price hits the same price level as the low after the neckline is broken ((b) point in this example)  
3)	When price hits 1.272 fib extension of (a)(b)  
4)	When price hits point (d) (using  AB=CD  pattern. If you are not sure what the rules of  AB=CD  are, you can refer to my previous TA in which I have attached the link below)  
5)	If in a one-way market (heavily bearish/bullish), you can always keep 10% to 20% of your positions and take profits when risk/reward ratio hits 1:5 or even 1:10

 BTC -1.12%  is on the verge of breaking to a daily higher high on the bounce if the bulls can see a push this morning. 
If we reject from here the daily will form a lower high and we will see a tightening pattern within the highlighted  support and resistance  lines.  
Important for the bulls to show up or we could stay in this range into tomorrow.  
Healthy consolidation after the most recent bull move and the 15 min chart needs to change the trend.  
Also look to  EMA  12 support on the 4 hour and hourly.  
Another morning like yesterday with the bulls comfortable as worst case, we likely stay in the tightening pattern if bulls cannot prove themselves.

The current situation of  Bitcoin -1.11%  is quite difficult. We are on a clear treshold. A lot of traders are saying that we are on a clear downtrend, but the same amount of people are claiming that we will have our reversal soon. 

This article tries to sum up all important information you have to need! 

1: Retracement of a parabolic uptrend: 
There is a rule of thumb for the retracement of a parabolic uptrend. We should retrace to approx. the 0.786  Fibonacci Retracement  +/- 10%! 
Depending where we start the count, we are already in that target. Although both ways (blue and red) have still some space for a further downwave! 







2: The bloody support of Bitcoin: 
The average cost of mining one  bitcoin -1.11%  are at USA/Russia approx. 4700$ and at 3100$ for china! 
A drop below a target of 4700$ would be savage. Nevertheless, i can't image that we will hit that target. 







3: Manipulation of  Bitcoin -1.11%  and the Bart Simpson Pattern: 
A friend of mine found some unusual patterns in the orderbooks of several exchanges: 
https://twitter.com/CryptoSyndrome 
Altcoins are manipulated on a daily basis. It seems that  bitcoin -1.11%  is now affected to this too, which causes all these 3-5% pump and dumps. 
Thus, we are forming all the time the Bartin Simpsons Patterns. 

4: Similarity to 2014: 
Bitcoin -1.11%  now: 






Bitcoin -1.11%  2014: 







5: Deminishing downtrend and a strong support 
If we see the falling  wedges  as the force of the downtrend, then the force is diminishing! 
Furthermore we have strong support which is holding now for the 4th time! 







6: The Indicators 
Having a look at the indicators at 2D, we have a good potential for an upwave now. 
The  volume  is deminishing which should indicate a breakout soon. 
The  MACD  is about to cross, the  RSI  was slightly overbought and is heading up like the  Stoch .  RSI . 
The 200  EMA  is slighty under the current price and act as a support. 

7: The symetrical Triangle 
The theory says, that we should have in a  sym -1.72% . triangle 5 times an  ABC  wave. The waves are not perfect, but we can construct them. 






As you can see, the last four ABC-Waves formed always a 1:1 extention, which indicates that we have finished wave 5. 

8: A possible Head and Shoulders 
Even if this is not the most perfect  Head and Shoulders  Pattern, it's still valid! 
We are currently at the neckline, which is a strong and important resistance. Breaking upwards should indicate a good uptrend. 







9: The magic  6th 0.00%  of the month 






Suprisingly we have on every  6th 0.00%  of the month a reversal. Why is that??? 
One reason could be the  CME Group Futures  with dates for the settlements always nearby the  6th 0.00%  of the month! 
http://www.cmegroup.com 

10: Longterm  Bullish  TA 
The whole pattern could be seen as a big  bullish pennant . 







11: Shortterm  Bullish  TA 
Leading diagonal  starting wave1 of an  Elliott Wave , since we have now an impulse wave, after the 5x  ABC  pattern inside the triangle is finished. 
Our target should be at the top of the triangle nearby 8600-8800$. 







12: Longterm  Bearish  TA 
We also can argue, that we are currenty in an downtrend and the  sym -1.72% . triangle just continuing the trend. 
Our target should be nearby 6000$ which is also a finished downwards  Elliott Wave .

Nothing is happening in the market:  volatility  has become extinct and coins' trading fallen out of fashion. Range-bound bots and robotic humans absolutely prosper in this environment. The price was unable to break the 7700 threshold. For me this is a  bearish  signal. Indicators provide mixed signals, so let's examine wave structure. The move from May 29 is a  3-wave -0.12%  correction within a larger downtrend. A price drop below 7500 would confirm this scenario.

					Impulse Wave Truncation (Truncated Fifth) - 
Truncated 5th wave is when the market has become so over-extended in Wave 3 that there is not much force left for the impulse wave to come to a proper completion. So when this happens, there is a chance that the last wave of the impulse, Wave 5, will not reach the end of Wave 3 before the market starts correcting in the opposite direction. At this point, the market is just too exhausted. This condition is often called a “failure” or a “Truncation.”

I can see many people still believe that we are going inside a  descending triangle . I also believed this in my idea that i shard on may 1st: 



 

Things can change so quickly and if we didn't adapt to the changes then someone will. That's why i believe that we have to be in fast adapt mode in this market. Doesn't mean that you need to change without checking yourself. I try to find 2-3 confirmations before i change my idea on something. This includes pattern changes, trend changes etc 

There are 21 corrective wave patterns in EW which is categorized into major 3 corrective wave patterns: 

Zigzag  (5-3-5) 
Flat (3-3-5) 
Triangle (3-3-3-3-3) 

And other patterns are combinations of the above which is:  

Double three (A combination of two corrective patterns above) 
Triple three (A combination of three corrective patterns above) 

So what i can see now is that we are in two double three combination corrective wave pattern: 








More info here:  

https://elliottwave-forecast.com/elliott-wave-theory/#corrective-waves 

Confirmations: 

1. Wave ((i)) of C is 1.6k and ((v)) is going to be completed below the triangle 
2. Wave (E) of the triangle can't go beyond the triangle.  
3. This has happened twice before in 2013 & 2015 

Each wave  got 3 subwaves (a,b &c) inside and we are in the subwave c of ((y)) of Y which is an impulsive wave. 

Impulsive waves: 1,3,5,a,c 
Corrective waves: 2,4,b 

Normal Fibo Ratios for these waves are: 

wave 2 = 0.5 - 0.8 of wave 1  
wave 3 = 1.236 - 1.618 of wave 1  
wave 4 = 0.5 - 0.618 of wave 3  
wave 5 = 0.618 - 1 of wave 1  
wave B = 0.5 - 0.8 of wave A  
wave C = 0.618 - 1.236 of wave A  

Now if you check what happened in subwave a of ((y)) of Y you can see that: 

Wave (i) of a: 985$ 
Wave (ii) of a: 434$  
Wave ( iii -0.65% ) of a: 1207$  
Wave (iv) of a: 691$ [~0.618 of Wave ( iii -0.65% )] 
Wave (v) of a: 950$  








I have seen  BTC -1.11%  impulsive waves fibo ratios almost the same as the previous impulsive wave fibo ratios. 
Now if you apply the same for the last wave C of (E) this is what you get: 

Wave ((i)) of c: 1587$ 
Wave ((ii)) of c  = 793$ 
Wave (( iii -0.65% )) of c  = 1961$ 
Wave ((iv)) of c [~0.618 of Wave (( iii -0.65% ))] = 1212$ 
Wave ((v)) of c  = 1587$ 








Also note that Wave ((iv)) might not retrace upto 0.618 of Wave (( iii -0.65% )) as everyone will be in panic mode by that time so minimum retracement would be around 0.386 of Wave (( iii -0.65% )) which is around 756$ and this is why i can see it goes down to 5k level or little bit more towards 4.7k which is the lowest level of the  support zone  (orange dotted lines) 








So 3 Possible Support lines for reversal would be 

1. Blue: 5800 - 6100 (Only possible if Wave ((v)) is truncated) 
2. Orange: 4700 - 5000 (This is most likely where we heading)  
3. Red: 4100 - 4400 (Only possible if Wave (( iii -0.65% )) is extended)

 Bitcoin -1.11%  has recently developed an interesting pattern of completing a  bullish  and  bearish  cycle on the sixth of every month in an alternating order. As we can see in the chart above, a fall is followed by a rise. This has happened twice before and is expected to happen again now on the  6th 0.00%  of June, 2018. This time  Bitcoin -1.11%  will finish a  bearish  cycle and I expected to begin the next  bullish  cycle at least till the end of  6th 0.00%  of July, 2018. 

This pattern of rise and fall is also supported by other patterns on the chart that signal a  bullish  reversal. The support line has also held firmly and if this pattern of alternating rise and fall ensues,  Bitcoin -1.11%  could very well make new highs by the end of the year. The  RSI  is recovering from oversold levels and has now approached a normal.  Bitcoin -1.11%  is currently at a favorable point for  bullish  entries. The price broke a long term resistance as it break past the downtrend line in April, 2018. This was a big accomplishment for the bulls but the lack of confidence pulled the price back to the support line. Currently, the price is just above the support line and appears to be all set for a  bullish  comeback but the reality is, there are not enough bulls in the market. 

The past few months have been devastating for the price of  Bitcoin -1.11%  ( BTC -1.11% ) and a lot of investors are still running scared. Institutional investors are looking for more clarity regarding regulations concerning cryptocurrencies and also safer ways to invest and store their coins. As for retail investors, most of them comprise of first time investors who have never traded any financial asset before. So, when they saw that  Bitcoin -1.11%  ( BTC -1.11% ) is making 20% gains every day, they thought this could go on forever and jumped with both feet, only to find the carpet pulled under from their feet. Big investors have always played small investors as cannon fodder and have gotten away with their schemes even in regulated markets like forex or the stock market. Cryptocurrencies is a new market with no proper regulations which means it is natural to expect that those who can afford to not play by the rules, most likely won’t.

Hello friends,  

It's been a while since my last post; lack of time and an urge to do more research has mainly driven me to take a break from posting ideas on TradingView. I am still in the process of doing more research and study, but I figure posting once in a while couldn't hurt. 

Since I have become recently very convinced about this, I am outlining a very possible situation with  Bitcoin -1.11%  where the  trend line  we have been on since early October breaks, reaching around a temporary low of $5000. This is examined on the  daily chart , since this is one of the best charts to examine trends of this size. I have to first and foremost say that I am not trying to spread fear, I know many people do not like to hear  bearish  ideas, but  technical analysis  is ultimately a rational exercise, and I feel that possibilities with very strong signs should be explored. 

There are a few things to look at, but I first want to talk about the big picture with, long-term  support and resistance  lines. I think most people can agree that there was a very significant downtrending resistance line that began from the peak of the  ATH 0.63%  in late December, to the low of around $6400 (thick red line). After the break from that line, it seems we moved into a sideways trend, bouncing back and forth between an emerging downtrending resistance line (light red) and a support line that we seem to have been respecting since mid-October (light green); at least this appears to be the case with the lows, where the angle's effectiveness appears very strongly. Finally, based on previous bounces, we can establish a support of around $5000-$5300 (I've thus created a small  support zone  around that range, in dark green), as well as lower supports around $3200 and $2000 (though I do not believe these will be reached, in dark green).   

Now, onto the analysis - it's no secret that  Bitcoin -1.11%  has been squeezing in, ready for a significant move either upwards or downwards. Initially I considered the upwards move to be more likely due to the significant media attention cryptocurrency has been receiving, but after viewing previous market cycles of  Bitcoin -1.11%  (check 2013), it seems clear to me that the  bearish  scenario of closing in on the market cycle is very likely, and should at the very least be prepared for with proper risk management. According to Dow Theory, which is said to have laid the foundations of modern  technical analysis , history repeats itself, and this is a situation where we forced to consider this. 

Should we break from the line, we will likely fall straight down to the $5000-$5000 area, where we will shoot back up and bounce towards around $6700 or so (maybe a little less). From there one, we will likely enter a sideways trend, which we will continue until we see higher highs and higher lows and parabolic movement returns, which could lead to us challenging the all-time high, and hitting $35k-$50k. 

NOTE: I seem to have reached the max character limit for this section of the idea, so I will continue my text below.

The reason why I have drawn this movement into a pennant is this way, is simply because we have been moving through this ascending triangle for quite a while now (May 23rd to today). I don't think that the pattern will be sufficient to directly lead into a strong sell-off, but we should consider that the size of ascending triangle suggests a small movement downwards at the very least, which can create a higher low, and thus move into position into a bearish pennant. Why would a bearish pennant occur here and not have a bounce to $8500-$8700? The reason is in positioning - the huge downtrend (May 5th to May 26th) creates a very nice flagpole in which it hits around the $5000 area very perfectly, and thus I would not be surprised if this happens. 

Second reason: on the Stoch RSI indicator on the daily chart, it appears to be dangerously high, which would suggest it being oversold. For the most part, it seems to have called lows and highs, at least to some extent. This overdrawn movement may very well have increased the likelyhood of Bitcoin being oversold. This could suggest that this is the last step into a sharp downturn, but this does not preclude Situation B. Volume has also been steadily decreasing, but this is the case with any sort of consolidation, I believe. 

Finally, the lines I have drawn below the triangle are simply bounces that I think seem fairly reasonable. The length from to support to the lines correlate with the length of the flagpole, of course, though it may seem chopped off due to the huge line from the long-term support downwards. 


Scenario B: 

This is much simpler, Bitcoin hits the upper resistance line, bounces off, challenges the lower support line, and we potentially see a break, and the rest unfolds from there. 


----------------------------------------------------------------------- 


With all this being said, do not fear if you are hoping for more parabolic movement - this likely will not be the end, and will simply be the set up for a long, drawn out sideways movement until the first signs of bullish activity begin and we start all over again. If you are longing around here, please consider using risk management, prepare for every possibility. If you are shorting, the same applies. 

Please trade with care. I wish the best to all traders!

Comment:
					This really is a very minor note, but I just want to emphasize that the rising wedge (which I erroneously refer to as an ascending triangle, a bad habit I have) entering a bearish pennant is more based on intuition than anything. Also, this pennant is mainly based on the conservative assumption that the break will happen at 7900, if it happens at 7700 where we seem to be general resistance, the pennant would look something like this:

Jun 7




I am Mid term-bullish on  BTC              going into the end of this week, but looking to get into the market on a pull back to occur before I get in to the market.  The jury is still out as to whether this weekly bear trend is ready to turn around.  

We can see that both the  RSI  and  MFI  are both  Bullish  on the daily having bottomed when reaching oversold on both at c. $7k support where we found our longer term  trend line . 

We are currently in the process of meeting the Tenkan (blue line) as I write this, so in the very short term, I am looking for a pull back to $7550 range for an entry.  One of the main reasons for this is that on the 4hour timeframes we are close to completing an edge to edge trade so the risk reward doesn’t fit my profile, however a break out from the cloud or above the Tenkan around $7777 will make me enter the market. 

The  RSI  and  MFI  have both been excellent indicators in this bear market.  Whenever  RSI  has gone above the 60 and the  MFI  80; its time to exit the market from a  bullish  trade and consider shorting as it progresses higher.   

Based on the  RSI ,  MFI  trends and the fact that we will run into the Kijun at just around $8-8.2k, I will be scalling out at this  bearish  confluence level to start looking for pull backs and reassessment as i believe it to be a key point as  

Best case scenario this trade would yield a 10% return before leverage. 
This is for illustrative purposes only, please DYOR and goodluck with your trading.

So the pullback trade that we were looking at worked out & has made it's way back to the neckline level of structure. We are now at what i like to call a ""decision point"" Essentially IF price is able to violate this current level od structure THEN we're likely to continue to our next price projection.  

Something that a lot of newer traders don't understand is that when it comes to bigger moves, the market will often provide multiple opportunities to get involved. For those who don't rush and for those who don't get discouraged. If you perform consistent analysis you can often find multiple ways to involve yourself in a trade even if you missed the first strike.

This is the way markets move, If you question my charting check my previous posts. Its as simple as pie. We are going down, How long and how far is too soon to say. Here is a chart that we can understand the future price action and where to buy back. Before you guys start blasting my comment section with the time and how it may not be right thats correct. I am not calculating the time I'm just making a technical drawing of the directions that we will see in the next few months.  

Recent price action has clear signs of wash trading / market manipulation fud and lots of nonsense. Its hard to prove almost impossible so as a trader we just need to deal with it. Ideally the situation you are supposed to trade are critical break up and break down points to enter the trade. Dont enter or exit dumb trades and lose money. As an experienced trader you should be looking for shorts, I would not consider a long unless we are over $10-12k

I am never good with words so instead of writing paragraphs of clarification to justify my call for SHORT since my last posting, I have explained everything on my chart with the least words possible using Fibonacci. It does not matter how popular  Bitcoin -1.11%  has become, or how deep it has disrupted the financial sector, or how many institutional investors have come to invest in it -- the psychology behind a market cycle does not change. 

I don't really encourage anyone to short  Bitcoin -1.11% , but in all honesty, don't expect the bulls to fly anytime soon. Like I said before, this correction that we are having right now is the ""MOTHER OF ALL CORRECTIONS"" after a 4-year-long bull cycle since the 2013 correction... and we are just halfway through.

My best idea ever, taking some time off the last 2 days :) The whales just continue to play their little games by squeezing leveraged short and long positions out of the market. Can't play them, it's just too easy. Maybe it's time we retail traders stand together, combine our  volume  and use their own game against them. Yeah, maybe we could even make a blockbuster movie about this :) I love me some science fiction :) LOL  

My last update of the previous analysis i showed 2 important support levels where the price could bounce up from. The first support around 7350 did the trick and the price got pushed back to 7700. From that point on i told my members that i thought i was seeing distribution, but it was still very confusing to figure out what was going on. TA was showing  bullish  signs, that  bull flag  was very strong and was even turning slowly up and was about to squeeze upwards. But of course out of no where the price got dumped, the move we saw a few hours ago. After that 200 point drop the price got pushed up again to 7700 like that dump was a glitch. If your a whale, why not push out leveraged traders and take your money while your accumulating or distributing. It's like a bonus, like the cherry on top :)  

Anyway, in this chart we can see allot of similarities of what is going on. As you know i have been saying i am still  bearish  for the medium term, but i just could not say what was going to happen on the short term. 2 days ago after we finally dropped out of that  wedge , i said we would have 2 options.  
- Break those 2 support levels from the last update of my previous chart (73xx and 71xx) 
- Make a higher low at those same support levels and make another move up above the high.  
 
As we can see in the chart, the  fractal  is not 100% identical so it's no guarantee that the 7700 high we just saw is the high already and that we start to move down. But based on this  fractal , i don't want to see the price get above the 7800/7900. This  fractal  confirms my  bearish  view as well. That's why TA is so great, you can turn any chart to fit your view :). 

Even without this  fractal , i just give it a very small chance that 7K price action is the fundament of a low to start another bull rally, i just highly doubt that. I want to see more  volume  to begin with and at least  double bottom  kind of formation. So the minimum i expect is a test of the 7100/6900in the coming week or 2. But the movement i have in mind for the med term is a drop below the 7K to form a big V shape low. If we get to see that, than i might even become  bullish  for the rest of the year :).  

As long as the price stays above the 73xx, we have to assume the bulls are still in control and we should see another wave up. So for me the 73xx is an important turning point.

Comment:
					This is my bigger picture, think this bearish triangle is still 100% in play. I think if bulls can't break the 7800/7900 the bearish version is probably going to happen. Can't say HOW it will go, this blue line is just a guess. But a big V shape low would be the most bullish for the long term. I still think we are seeing distribution here. The only way this idea can be countered, is through a big increase of buying volume, if that doesn't happen, i think it's only a matter of time.

The price took a small dump but the volume was low so no real read on what the intent was. So we might see another move up, if we start to see a small pump that takes out the 7800, be aware of a fake breakout. The blue line is a possibility of what the move could look like IF we move up and if the breakout fails. If that happens than we will probably get confirmation if the price breaks the 7600ish. If we break the 7800 it should stay above the 7700 to confirm another move up. Not much more to say about what's going on.

127,1528359434.0,Taiwan_Bear,2618 (Double top & 0.618 pull-back) - do not miss it!!,"
In the last couple of TAs I have mentioned the “2618 pattern” and have been asked what 2618 means. Sorry for taking it so long as it took me quite a while to put everything altogether. But, as promised, I have explained below the rules and trade setups for the 2618 pattern.  

What are the rules/setups/steps for 2618?  
1.	Form a  double top  (Note #1)  
2.	Neckline has to be broken  
3.	After price found support at point (b), wait for pull back to 0.618 fib retracement of (a)(b)  
4.	After price retraced to 0.618, look for confluence and sell (eg. Structures,  trendlines  ,  double top  on a lower time frame,  rsi  divergence,  bearish pin bar  ,  inside bar  break down etc.) (Note #2)  
5.	Stop loss to be set above  double top 
6.	Set Take Profit levels (Note #3)  

Note #1 ( Double top ):  
The first step for the formation of 2618 is to form a  double top  at key resistance levels. Why at key resistance levels? Because we want to avoid fake double tops which can occur occasionally.  

There are some variations between various resources (books, websites) regarding the definitions of “double top”. The main differences occur where:  
a)	Some said for a  double top  to be valid, the wick of the 2nd top cannot exceed the wick of the 1st top; whereas, others said:  
b)	The wick of the 2nd top can exceed the wick of the 1st top but the candle close of the 2nd top CANNOT exceed the wick of the 1st top; or  
c)	The wick of the 2nd top can exceed the wick of the 1st top and the candle close of the 2nd top CAN exceed the wick of the 1st top; or  
d)	The wick of the 2nd top meets at least the candle close of the 1st top; or  
e)	The body of the 2nd top cannot exceed the body of the 1st top  

Personally, I would say all the above definitions work just fine although I do prefer definition a) because it means that the selling pressure is strong and the bulls fail to make a higher high. When there is a higher high formed in a downtrend, it can mean the downtrend has reversed and therefore you might not want to sell when the price pulls back to the 0.618 fib retracement.  

Note #2 ( 0.618 retracement ):  
When the price pulls back to 0.618, it does not mean to sell straight away. There must be more than one reason to sell other than the 0.618 retrace. The more reasons the better. In this example, you can see there are certainly structures (key resistance levels) at the 0.618 retrace. As well, there was a  double top  formed on the lower time frame. Consequently, you can sell.  

After  BTC -1.11%  hit the 0.618 retrace the first time, the price dropped from $9735 to $8650. but quickly bounced back to the 0.618 retrace level. That was a second & better opportunity to sell. Not only did  BTC -1.11%  form a  double top  on the larger time frame, but also with a  bearish  divergence on the 4hr time frame. Accordingly, you have more reasons to sell.  

Note #3 (Set take profit)  
Same as the rules of “Double top”, there are some variations as to which price level should you take profits. Personally, I would stick to the below:  
1)	First, take profit when risk/reward ratio hits 1:1 (recommend to take 30% - 50% profits and adjust the SL of the remaining positions to break-even)  
2)	When price hits the same price level as the low after the neckline is broken ((b) point in this example)  
3)	When price hits 1.272 fib extension of (a)(b)  
4)	When price hits point (d) (using  AB=CD  pattern. If you are not sure what the rules of  AB=CD  are, you can refer to my previous TA in which I have attached the link below)  
5)	If in a one-way market (heavily bearish/bullish), you can always keep 10% to 20% of your positions and take profits when risk/reward ratio hits 1:5 or even 1:10

 BTC -1.11%  is on the verge of breaking to a daily higher high on the bounce if the bulls can see a push this morning. 
If we reject from here the daily will form a lower high and we will see a tightening pattern within the highlighted  support and resistance  lines.  
Important for the bulls to show up or we could stay in this range into tomorrow.  
Healthy consolidation after the most recent bull move and the 15 min chart needs to change the trend.  
Also look to  EMA  12 support on the 4 hour and hourly.

The current situation of  Bitcoin -1.11%  is quite difficult. We are on a clear treshold. A lot of traders are saying that we are on a clear downtrend, but the same amount of people are claiming that we will have our reversal soon. 

This article tries to sum up all important information you have to need! 

1: Retracement of a parabolic uptrend: 
There is a rule of thumb for the retracement of a parabolic uptrend. We should retrace to approx. the 0.786  Fibonacci Retracement  +/- 10%! 
Depending where we start the count, we are already in that target. Although both ways (blue and red) have still some space for a further downwave! 







2: The bloody support of Bitcoin: 
The average cost of mining one  bitcoin -1.11%  are at USA/Russia approx. 4700$ and at 3100$ for china! 
A drop below a target of 4700$ would be savage. Nevertheless, i can't image that we will hit that target. 







3: Manipulation of  Bitcoin -1.11%  and the Bart Simpson Pattern: 
A friend of mine found some unusual patterns in the orderbooks of several exchanges: 
https://twitter.com/CryptoSyndrome 
Altcoins are manipulated on a daily basis. It seems that  bitcoin -1.11%  is now affected to this too, which causes all these 3-5% pump and dumps. 
Thus, we are forming all the time the Bartin Simpsons Patterns. 

4: Similarity to 2014: 
Bitcoin -1.11%  now: 






Bitcoin -1.11%  2014: 







5: Deminishing downtrend and a strong support 
If we see the falling  wedges  as the force of the downtrend, then the force is diminishing! 
Furthermore we have strong support which is holding now for the 4th time! 







6: The Indicators 
Having a look at the indicators at 2D, we have a good potential for an upwave now. 
The  volume  is deminishing which should indicate a breakout soon. 
The  MACD  is about to cross, the  RSI  was slightly overbought and is heading up like the  Stoch .  RSI . 
The 200  EMA  is slighty under the current price and act as a support. 

7: The symetrical Triangle 
The theory says, that we should have in a  sym -1.72% . triangle 5 times an  ABC  wave. The waves are not perfect, but we can construct them. 






As you can see, the last four ABC-Waves formed always a 1:1 extention, which indicates that we have finished wave 5. 

8: A possible Head and Shoulders 
Even if this is not the most perfect  Head and Shoulders  Pattern, it's still valid! 
We are currently at the neckline, which is a strong and important resistance. Breaking upwards should indicate a good uptrend. 







9: The magic  6th 0.00%  of the month 






Suprisingly we have on every  6th 0.00%  of the month a reversal. Why is that??? 
One reason could be the  CME Group Futures  with dates for the settlements always nearby the  6th 0.00%  of the month! 
http://www.cmegroup.com 

10: Longterm  Bullish  TA 
The whole pattern could be seen as a big  bullish pennant . 







11: Shortterm  Bullish  TA 
Leading diagonal  starting wave1 of an  Elliott Wave , since we have now an impulse wave, after the 5x  ABC  pattern inside the triangle is finished. 
Our target should be at the top of the triangle nearby 8600-8800$. 







12: Longterm  Bearish  TA 
We also can argue, that we are currenty in an downtrend and the  sym -1.72% . triangle just continuing the trend. 
Our target should be nearby 6000$ which is also a finished downwards  Elliott Wave .

Nothing is happening in the market:  volatility  has become extinct and coins' trading fallen out of fashion. Range-bound bots and robotic humans absolutely prosper in this environment. The price was unable to break the 7700 threshold. For me this is a  bearish  signal. Indicators provide mixed signals, so let's examine wave structure. The move from May 29 is a  3-wave -0.12%  correction within a larger downtrend. A price drop below 7500 would confirm this scenario.

					Impulse Wave Truncation (Truncated Fifth) - 
Truncated 5th wave is when the market has become so over-extended in Wave 3 that there is not much force left for the impulse wave to come to a proper completion. So when this happens, there is a chance that the last wave of the impulse, Wave 5, will not reach the end of Wave 3 before the market starts correcting in the opposite direction. At this point, the market is just too exhausted. This condition is often called a “failure” or a “Truncation.”

I can see many people still believe that we are going inside a  descending triangle . I also believed this in my idea that i shard on may 1st: 



 

Things can change so quickly and if we didn't adapt to the changes then someone will. That's why i believe that we have to be in fast adapt mode in this market. Doesn't mean that you need to change without checking yourself. I try to find 2-3 confirmations before i change my idea on something. This includes pattern changes, trend changes etc 

There are 21 corrective wave patterns in EW which is categorized into major 3 corrective wave patterns: 

Zigzag  (5-3-5) 
Flat (3-3-5) 
Triangle (3-3-3-3-3) 

And other patterns are combinations of the above which is:  

Double three (A combination of two corrective patterns above) 
Triple three (A combination of three corrective patterns above) 

So what i can see now is that we are in two double three combination corrective wave pattern:

1. Wave ((i)) of C is 1.6k and ((v)) is going to be completed below the triangle 
2. Wave (E) of the triangle can't go beyond the triangle.  
3. This has happened twice before in 2013 & 2015 

Each wave  got 3 subwaves (a,b &c) inside and we are in the subwave c of ((y)) of Y which is an impulsive wave. 

Impulsive waves: 1,3,5,a,c 
Corrective waves: 2,4,b 

Normal Fibo Ratios for these waves are: 

wave 2 = 0.5 - 0.8 of wave 1  
wave 3 = 1.236 - 1.618 of wave 1  
wave 4 = 0.5 - 0.618 of wave 3  
wave 5 = 0.618 - 1 of wave 1  
wave B = 0.5 - 0.8 of wave A  
wave C = 0.618 - 1.236 of wave A  

Now if you check what happened in subwave a of ((y)) of Y you can see that: 

Wave (i) of a: 985$ 
Wave (ii) of a: 434$  
Wave ( iii -0.62% ) of a: 1207$  
Wave (iv) of a: 691$ [~0.618 of Wave ( iii -0.62% )] 
Wave (v) of a: 950$  








I have seen  BTC              impulsive waves fibo ratios almost the same as the previous impulsive wave fibo ratios. 
Now if you apply the same for the last wave C of (E) this is what you get: 

Wave ((i)) of c: 1587$ 
Wave ((ii)) of c  = 793$ 
Wave (( iii -0.62% )) of c  = 1961$ 
Wave ((iv)) of c [~0.618 of Wave (( iii -0.62% ))] = 1212$ 
Wave ((v)) of c  = 1587$ 








Also note that Wave ((iv)) might not retrace upto 0.618 of Wave (( iii -0.62% )) as everyone will be in panic mode by that time so minimum retracement would be around 0.386 of Wave (( iii -0.62% )) which is around 756$ and this is why i can see it goes down to 5k level or little bit more towards 4.7k which is the lowest level of the  support zone  (orange dotted lines) 








So 3 Possible Support lines for reversal would be 

1. Blue: 5800 - 6100 (Only possible if Wave ((v)) is truncated) 
2. Orange: 4700 - 5000 (This is most likely where we heading)  
3. Red: 4100 - 4400 (Only possible if Wave (( iii -0.62% )) is extended)

 Bitcoin -1.08%  has recently developed an interesting pattern of completing a  bullish  and  bearish  cycle on the sixth of every month in an alternating order. As we can see in the chart above, a fall is followed by a rise. This has happened twice before and is expected to happen again now on the  6th 0.00%  of June, 2018. This time  Bitcoin -1.08%  will finish a  bearish  cycle and I expected to begin the next  bullish  cycle at least till the end of  6th 0.00%  of July, 2018. 

This pattern of rise and fall is also supported by other patterns on the chart that signal a  bullish  reversal. The support line has also held firmly and if this pattern of alternating rise and fall ensues,  Bitcoin -1.08%  could very well make new highs by the end of the year. The  RSI  is recovering from oversold levels and has now approached a normal.  Bitcoin -1.08%  is currently at a favorable point for  bullish  entries. The price broke a long term resistance as it break past the downtrend line in April, 2018. This was a big accomplishment for the bulls but the lack of confidence pulled the price back to the support line. Currently, the price is just above the support line and appears to be all set for a  bullish  comeback but the reality is, there are not enough bulls in the market. 

The past few months have been devastating for the price of  Bitcoin -1.08%  ( BTC -1.08% ) and a lot of investors are still running scared. Institutional investors are looking for more clarity regarding regulations concerning cryptocurrencies and also safer ways to invest and store their coins. As for retail investors, most of them comprise of first time investors who have never traded any financial asset before. So, when they saw that  Bitcoin -1.08%  ( BTC -1.08% ) is making 20% gains every day, they thought this could go on forever and jumped with both feet, only to find the carpet pulled under from their feet. Big investors have always played small investors as cannon fodder and have gotten away with their schemes even in regulated markets like forex or the stock market. Cryptocurrencies is a new market with no proper regulations which means it is natural to expect that those who can afford to not play by the rules, most likely won’t.

Hello friends,  

It's been a while since my last post; lack of time and an urge to do more research has mainly driven me to take a break from posting ideas on TradingView. I am still in the process of doing more research and study, but I figure posting once in a while couldn't hurt. 

Since I have become recently very convinced about this, I am outlining a very possible situation with  Bitcoin -1.05%  where the  trend line  we have been on since early October breaks, reaching around a temporary low of $5000. This is examined on the  daily chart , since this is one of the best charts to examine trends of this size. I have to first and foremost say that I am not trying to spread fear, I know many people do not like to hear  bearish  ideas, but  technical analysis  is ultimately a rational exercise, and I feel that possibilities with very strong signs should be explored. 

There are a few things to look at, but I first want to talk about the big picture with, long-term  support and resistance  lines. I think most people can agree that there was a very significant downtrending resistance line that began from the peak of the  ATH 0.63%  in late December, to the low of around $6400 (thick red line). After the break from that line, it seems we moved into a sideways trend, bouncing back and forth between an emerging downtrending resistance line (light red) and a support line that we seem to have been respecting since mid-October (light green); at least this appears to be the case with the lows, where the angle's effectiveness appears very strongly. Finally, based on previous bounces, we can establish a support of around $5000-$5300 (I've thus created a small  support zone  around that range, in dark green), as well as lower supports around $3200 and $2000 (though I do not believe these will be reached, in dark green).   

Now, onto the analysis - it's no secret that  Bitcoin -1.05%  has been squeezing in, ready for a significant move either upwards or downwards. Initially I considered the upwards move to be more likely due to the significant media attention cryptocurrency has been receiving, but after viewing previous market cycles of  Bitcoin -1.05%  (check 2013), it seems clear to me that the  bearish  scenario of closing in on the market cycle is very likely, and should at the very least be prepared for with proper risk management. According to Dow Theory, which is said to have laid the foundations of modern  technical analysis , history repeats itself, and this is a situation where we forced to consider this. 

Should we break from the line, we will likely fall straight down to the $5000-$5000 area, where we will shoot back up and bounce towards around $6700 or so (maybe a little less). From there one, we will likely enter a sideways trend, which we will continue until we see higher highs and higher lows and parabolic movement returns, which could lead to us challenging the all-time high, and hitting $35k-$50k. 

NOTE: I seem to have reached the max character limit for this section of the idea, so I will continue my text below.

Comment:
					Onto the short-term: 


Scenario A: 

The reason why I have drawn this movement into a pennant is this way, is simply because we have been moving through this ascending triangle for quite a while now (May 23rd to today). I don't think that the pattern will be sufficient to directly lead into a strong sell-off, but we should consider that the size of ascending triangle suggests a small movement downwards at the very least, which can create a higher low, and thus move into position into a bearish pennant. Why would a bearish pennant occur here and not have a bounce to $8500-$8700? The reason is in positioning - the huge downtrend (May 5th to May 26th) creates a very nice flagpole in which it hits around the $5000 area very perfectly, and thus I would not be surprised if this happens. 

Second reason: on the Stoch RSI indicator on the daily chart, it appears to be dangerously high, which would suggest it being oversold. For the most part, it seems to have called lows and highs, at least to some extent. This overdrawn movement may very well have increased the likelyhood of Bitcoin being oversold. This could suggest that this is the last step into a sharp downturn, but this does not preclude Situation B. Volume has also been steadily decreasing, but this is the case with any sort of consolidation, I believe. 

Finally, the lines I have drawn below the triangle are simply bounces that I think seem fairly reasonable. The length from to support to the lines correlate with the length of the flagpole, of course, though it may seem chopped off due to the huge line from the long-term support downwards. 


Scenario B: 

This is much simpler, Bitcoin hits the upper resistance line, bounces off, challenges the lower support line, and we potentially see a break, and the rest unfolds from there. 


----------------------------------------------------------------------- 


With all this being said, do not fear if you are hoping for more parabolic movement - this likely will not be the end, and will simply be the set up for a long, drawn out sideways movement until the first signs of bullish activity begin and we start all over again. If you are longing around here, please consider using risk management, prepare for every possibility. If you are shorting, the same applies. 

Please trade with care. I wish the best to all traders!

Comment:
					This really is a very minor note, but I just want to emphasize that the rising wedge (which I erroneously refer to as an ascending triangle, a bad habit I have) entering a bearish pennant is more based on intuition than anything. Also, this pennant is mainly based on the conservative assumption that the break will happen at 7900, if it happens at 7700 where we seem to be general resistance, the pennant would look something like this:

Jun 7




I am Mid term-bullish on  BTC -1.05%  going into the end of this week, but looking to get into the market on a pull back to occur before I get in to the market.  The jury is still out as to whether this weekly bear trend is ready to turn around.  

We can see that both the  RSI  and  MFI  are both  Bullish  on the daily having bottomed when reaching oversold on both at c. $7k support where we found our longer term  trend line . 

We are currently in the process of meeting the Tenkan (blue line) as I write this, so in the very short term, I am looking for a pull back to $7550 range for an entry.  One of the main reasons for this is that on the 4hour timeframes we are close to completing an edge to edge trade so the risk reward doesn’t fit my profile, however a break out from the cloud or above the Tenkan around $7777 will make me enter the market. 

The  RSI  and  MFI  have both been excellent indicators in this bear market.  Whenever  RSI  has gone above the 60 and the  MFI  80; its time to exit the market from a  bullish  trade and consider shorting as it progresses higher.   

Based on the  RSI ,  MFI  trends and the fact that we will run into the Kijun at just around $8-8.2k, I will be scalling out at this  bearish  confluence level to start looking for pull backs and reassessment as i believe it to be a key point as  

Best case scenario this trade would yield a 10% return before leverage. 
This is for illustrative purposes only, please DYOR and goodluck with your trading.

So the pullback trade that we were looking at worked out & has made it's way back to the neckline level of structure. We are now at what i like to call a ""decision point"" Essentially IF price is able to violate this current level od structure THEN we're likely to continue to our next price projection.  

Something that a lot of newer traders don't understand is that when it comes to bigger moves, the market will often provide multiple opportunities to get involved. For those who don't rush and for those who don't get discouraged. If you perform consistent analysis you can often find multiple ways to involve yourself in a trade even if you missed the first strike.

Recent price action has clear signs of wash trading / market manipulation fud and lots of nonsense. Its hard to prove almost impossible so as a trader we just need to deal with it. Ideally the situation you are supposed to trade are critical break up and break down points to enter the trade. Dont enter or exit dumb trades and lose money.

I am never good with words so instead of writing paragraphs of clarification to justify my call for SHORT since my last posting, I have explained everything on my chart with the least words possible using Fibonacci. It does not matter how popular  Bitcoin -1.05%  has become, or how deep it has disrupted the financial sector, or how many institutional investors have come to invest in it -- the psychology behind a market cycle does not change. 

I don't really encourage anyone to short  Bitcoin -1.05% , but in all honesty, don't expect the bulls to fly anytime soon. Like I said before, this correction that we are having right now is the ""MOTHER OF ALL CORRECTIONS"" after a 4-year-long bull cycle since the 2013 correction... and we are just halfway through.

My best idea ever, taking some time off the last 2 days :) The whales just continue to play their little games by squeezing leveraged short and long positions out of the market. Can't play them, it's just too easy. Maybe it's time we retail traders stand together, combine our  volume  and use their own game against them. Yeah, maybe we could even make a blockbuster movie about this :) I love me some science fiction :) LOL  

My last update of the previous analysis i showed 2 important support levels where the price could bounce up from. The first support around 7350 did the trick and the price got pushed back to 7700. From that point on i told my members that i thought i was seeing distribution, but it was still very confusing to figure out what was going on. TA was showing  bullish  signs, that  bull flag  was very strong and was even turning slowly up and was about to squeeze upwards. But of course out of no where the price got dumped, the move we saw a few hours ago. After that 200 point drop the price got pushed up again to 7700 like that dump was a glitch. If your a whale, why not push out leveraged traders and take your money while your accumulating or distributing. It's like a bonus, like the cherry on top :)  

Anyway, in this chart we can see allot of similarities of what is going on. As you know i have been saying i am still  bearish  for the medium term, but i just could not say what was going to happen on the short term. 2 days ago after we finally dropped out of that  wedge , i said we would have 2 options.  
- Break those 2 support levels from the last update of my previous chart (73xx and 71xx) 
- Make a higher low at those same support levels and make another move up above the high.  
 
As we can see in the chart, the  fractal  is not 100% identical so it's no guarantee that the 7700 high we just saw is the high already and that we start to move down. But based on this  fractal , i don't want to see the price get above the 7800/7900. This  fractal  confirms my  bearish  view as well. That's why TA is so great, you can turn any chart to fit your view :). 

Even without this  fractal , i just give it a very small chance that 7K price action is the fundament of a low to start another bull rally, i just highly doubt that. I want to see more  volume  to begin with and at least  double bottom  kind of formation. So the minimum i expect is a test of the 7100/6900in the coming week or 2. But the movement i have in mind for the med term is a drop below the 7K to form a big V shape low. If we get to see that, than i might even become  bullish  for the rest of the year :).  

As long as the price stays above the 73xx, we have to assume the bulls are still in control and we should see another wave up. So for me the 73xx is an important turning point.

					This is my bigger picture, think this bearish triangle is still 100% in play. I think if bulls can't break the 7800/7900 the bearish version is probably going to happen. Can't say HOW it will go, this blue line is just a guess. But a big V shape low would be the most bullish for the long term. I still think we are seeing distribution here. The only way this idea can be countered, is through a big increase of buying volume, if that doesn't happen, i think it's only a matter of time.

The price took a small dump but the volume was low so no real read on what the intent was. So we might see another move up, if we start to see a small pump that takes out the 7800, be aware of a fake breakout. The blue line is a possibility of what the move could look like IF we move up and if the breakout fails. If that happens than we will probably get confirmation if the price breaks the 7600ish. If we break the 7800 it should stay above the 7700 to confirm another move up. Not much more to say about what's going on.

145,1528359434.0,Taiwan_Bear,2618 (Double top & 0.618 pull-back) - do not miss it!!,"
In the last couple of TAs I have mentioned the “2618 pattern” and have been asked what 2618 means. Sorry for taking it so long as it took me quite a while to put everything altogether. But, as promised, I have explained below the rules and trade setups for the 2618 pattern.  

What are the rules/setups/steps for 2618?  
1.	Form a  double top  (Note #1)  
2.	Neckline has to be broken  
3.	After price found support at point (b), wait for pull back to 0.618 fib retracement of (a)(b)  
4.	After price retraced to 0.618, look for confluence and sell (eg. Structures,  trendlines  ,  double top  on a lower time frame,  rsi  divergence,  bearish pin bar  ,  inside bar  break down etc.) (Note #2)  
5.	Stop loss to be set above  double top 
6.	Set Take Profit levels (Note #3)  

Note #1 ( Double top ):  
The first step for the formation of 2618 is to form a  double top  at key resistance levels. Why at key resistance levels? Because we want to avoid fake double tops which can occur occasionally.  

There are some variations between various resources (books, websites) regarding the definitions of “double top”. The main differences occur where:  
a)	Some said for a  double top  to be valid, the wick of the 2nd top cannot exceed the wick of the 1st top; whereas, others said:  
b)	The wick of the 2nd top can exceed the wick of the 1st top but the candle close of the 2nd top CANNOT exceed the wick of the 1st top; or  
c)	The wick of the 2nd top can exceed the wick of the 1st top and the candle close of the 2nd top CAN exceed the wick of the 1st top; or  
d)	The wick of the 2nd top meets at least the candle close of the 1st top; or  
e)	The body of the 2nd top cannot exceed the body of the 1st top  

Personally, I would say all the above definitions work just fine although I do prefer definition a) because it means that the selling pressure is strong and the bulls fail to make a higher high. When there is a higher high formed in a downtrend, it can mean the downtrend has reversed and therefore you might not want to sell when the price pulls back to the 0.618 fib retracement.  

Note #2 ( 0.618 retracement ):  
When the price pulls back to 0.618, it does not mean to sell straight away. There must be more than one reason to sell other than the 0.618 retrace. The more reasons the better. In this example, you can see there are certainly structures (key resistance levels) at the 0.618 retrace. As well, there was a  double top  formed on the lower time frame. Consequently, you can sell.  

After  BTC -1.05%  hit the 0.618 retrace the first time, the price dropped from $9735 to $8650. but quickly bounced back to the 0.618 retrace level. That was a second & better opportunity to sell. Not only did  BTC -1.05%  form a  double top  on the larger time frame, but also with a  bearish  divergence on the 4hr time frame. Accordingly, you have more reasons to sell.  

Note #3 (Set take profit)  
Same as the rules of “Double top”, there are some variations as to which price level should you take profits. Personally, I would stick to the below:  
1)	First, take profit when risk/reward ratio hits 1:1 (recommend to take 30% - 50% profits and adjust the SL of the remaining positions to break-even)

 BTC -1.05%  is on the verge of breaking to a daily higher high on the bounce if the bulls can see a push this morning. 
If we reject from here the daily will form a lower high and we will see a tightening pattern within the highlighted  support and resistance  lines.  
Important for the bulls to show up or we could stay in this range into tomorrow.  
Healthy consolidation after the most recent bull move and the 15 min chart needs to change the trend.  
Also look to  EMA  12 support on the 4 hour and hourly.  
Another morning like yesterday with the bulls comfortable as worst case, we likely stay in the tightening pattern if bulls cannot prove themselves.

The current situation of  Bitcoin -1.04%  is quite difficult. We are on a clear treshold. A lot of traders are saying that we are on a clear downtrend, but the same amount of people are claiming that we will have our reversal soon. 

This article tries to sum up all important information you have to need! 

1: Retracement of a parabolic uptrend: 
There is a rule of thumb for the retracement of a parabolic uptrend. We should retrace to approx. the 0.786  Fibonacci Retracement  +/- 10%! 
Depending where we start the count, we are already in that target. Although both ways (blue and red) have still some space for a further downwave! 







2: The bloody support of Bitcoin: 
The average cost of mining one  bitcoin -1.04%  are at USA/Russia approx. 4700$ and at 3100$ for china! 
A drop below a target of 4700$ would be savage. Nevertheless, i can't image that we will hit that target. 







3: Manipulation of  Bitcoin -1.04%  and the Bart Simpson Pattern: 
A friend of mine found some unusual patterns in the orderbooks of several exchanges: 
https://twitter.com/CryptoSyndrome 
Altcoins are manipulated on a daily basis. It seems that  bitcoin -1.04%  is now affected to this too, which causes all these 3-5% pump and dumps. 
Thus, we are forming all the time the Bartin Simpsons Patterns. 

4: Similarity to 2014: 
Bitcoin -1.04%  now: 






Bitcoin -1.04%  2014: 







5: Deminishing downtrend and a strong support 
If we see the falling  wedges  as the force of the downtrend, then the force is diminishing! 
Furthermore we have strong support which is holding now for the 4th time! 







6: The Indicators 
Having a look at the indicators at 2D, we have a good potential for an upwave now. 
The  volume  is deminishing which should indicate a breakout soon. 
The  MACD  is about to cross, the  RSI  was slightly overbought and is heading up like the  Stoch .  RSI . 
The 200  EMA  is slighty under the current price and act as a support. 

7: The symetrical Triangle 
The theory says, that we should have in a  sym -1.72% . triangle 5 times an  ABC  wave. The waves are not perfect, but we can construct them. 






As you can see, the last four ABC-Waves formed always a 1:1 extention, which indicates that we have finished wave 5. 

8: A possible Head and Shoulders 
Even if this is not the most perfect  Head and Shoulders  Pattern, it's still valid! 
We are currently at the neckline, which is a strong and important resistance. Breaking upwards should indicate a good uptrend. 







9: The magic  6th 0.00%  of the month 






Suprisingly we have on every  6th 0.00%  of the month a reversal. Why is that??? 
One reason could be the  CME Group Futures  with dates for the settlements always nearby the  6th 0.00%  of the month! 
http://www.cmegroup.com 

10: Longterm  Bullish  TA 
The whole pattern could be seen as a big  bullish pennant . 







11: Shortterm  Bullish  TA 
Leading diagonal  starting wave1 of an  Elliott Wave , since we have now an impulse wave, after the 5x  ABC  pattern inside the triangle is finished. 
Our target should be at the top of the triangle nearby 8600-8800$. 







12: Longterm  Bearish  TA 
We also can argue, that we are currenty in an downtrend and the  sym -1.72% . triangle just continuing the trend. 
Our target should be nearby 6000$ which is also a finished downwards  Elliott Wave .

Nothing is happening in the market:  volatility  has become extinct and coins' trading fallen out of fashion. Range-bound bots and robotic humans absolutely prosper in this environment. The price was unable to break the 7700 threshold. For me this is a  bearish  signal. Indicators provide mixed signals, so let's examine wave structure. The move from May 29 is a  3-wave -0.12%  correction within a larger downtrend. A price drop below 7500 would confirm this scenario.

					Impulse Wave Truncation (Truncated Fifth) - 
Truncated 5th wave is when the market has become so over-extended in Wave 3 that there is not much force left for the impulse wave to come to a proper completion. So when this happens, there is a chance that the last wave of the impulse, Wave 5, will not reach the end of Wave 3 before the market starts correcting in the opposite direction. At this point, the market is just too exhausted. This condition is often called a “failure” or a “Truncation.”

I can see many people still believe that we are going inside a  descending triangle . I also believed this in my idea that i shard on may 1st: 



 

Things can change so quickly and if we didn't adapt to the changes then someone will. That's why i believe that we have to be in fast adapt mode in this market. Doesn't mean that you need to change without checking yourself. I try to find 2-3 confirmations before i change my idea on something. This includes pattern changes, trend changes etc 

There are 21 corrective wave patterns in EW which is categorized into major 3 corrective wave patterns: 

Zigzag  (5-3-5) 
Flat (3-3-5) 
Triangle (3-3-3-3-3) 

And other patterns are combinations of the above which is:  

Double three (A combination of two corrective patterns above) 
Triple three (A combination of three corrective patterns above) 

So what i can see now is that we are in two double three combination corrective wave pattern: 








More info here:  

https://elliottwave-forecast.com/elliott-wave-theory/#corrective-waves 

Confirmations: 

1. Wave ((i)) of C is 1.6k and ((v)) is going to be completed below the triangle 
2. Wave (E) of the triangle can't go beyond the triangle.  
3. This has happened twice before in 2013 & 2015 

Each wave  got 3 subwaves (a,b &c) inside and we are in the subwave c of ((y)) of Y which is an impulsive wave. 

Impulsive waves: 1,3,5,a,c 
Corrective waves: 2,4,b 

Normal Fibo Ratios for these waves are: 

wave 2 = 0.5 - 0.8 of wave 1  
wave 3 = 1.236 - 1.618 of wave 1  
wave 4 = 0.5 - 0.618 of wave 3  
wave 5 = 0.618 - 1 of wave 1  
wave B = 0.5 - 0.8 of wave A  
wave C = 0.618 - 1.236 of wave A  

Now if you check what happened in subwave a of ((y)) of Y you can see that: 

Wave (i) of a: 985$ 
Wave (ii) of a: 434$  
Wave ( iii -0.62% ) of a: 1207$  
Wave (iv) of a: 691$ [~0.618 of Wave ( iii -0.62% )] 
Wave (v) of a: 950$  








I have seen  BTC -1.03%  impulsive waves fibo ratios almost the same as the previous impulsive wave fibo ratios. 
Now if you apply the same for the last wave C of (E) this is what you get: 

Wave ((i)) of c: 1587$ 
Wave ((ii)) of c  = 793$ 
Wave (( iii -0.62% )) of c  = 1961$ 
Wave ((iv)) of c [~0.618 of Wave (( iii -0.62% ))] = 1212$ 
Wave ((v)) of c  = 1587$ 








Also note that Wave ((iv)) might not retrace upto 0.618 of Wave (( iii -0.62% )) as everyone will be in panic mode by that time so minimum retracement would be around 0.386 of Wave (( iii -0.62% )) which is around 756$ and this is why i can see it goes down to 5k level or little bit more towards 4.7k which is the lowest level of the  support zone  (orange dotted lines) 








So 3 Possible Support lines for reversal would be 

1. Blue: 5800 - 6100 (Only possible if Wave ((v)) is truncated) 
2. Orange: 4700 - 5000 (This is most likely where we heading)  
3. Red: 4100 - 4400 (Only possible if Wave (( iii -0.62% )) is extended)

 Bitcoin -1.03%  has recently developed an interesting pattern of completing a  bullish  and  bearish  cycle on the sixth of every month in an alternating order. As we can see in the chart above, a fall is followed by a rise. This has happened twice before and is expected to happen again now on the  6th 0.00%  of June, 2018. This time  Bitcoin -1.03%  will finish a  bearish  cycle and I expected to begin the next  bullish  cycle at least till the end of  6th 0.00%  of July, 2018. 

This pattern of rise and fall is also supported by other patterns on the chart that signal a  bullish  reversal. The support line has also held firmly and if this pattern of alternating rise and fall ensues,  Bitcoin -1.03%  could very well make new highs by the end of the year. The  RSI  is recovering from oversold levels and has now approached a normal.  Bitcoin -1.03%  is currently at a favorable point for  bullish  entries. The price broke a long term resistance as it break past the downtrend line in April, 2018. This was a big accomplishment for the bulls but the lack of confidence pulled the price back to the support line. Currently, the price is just above the support line and appears to be all set for a  bullish  comeback but the reality is, there are not enough bulls in the market. 

The past few months have been devastating for the price of  Bitcoin -1.03%  ( BTC -1.03% ) and a lot of investors are still running scared. Institutional investors are looking for more clarity regarding regulations concerning cryptocurrencies and also safer ways to invest and store their coins. As for retail investors, most of them comprise of first time investors who have never traded any financial asset before. So, when they saw that  Bitcoin -1.03%  ( BTC -1.03% ) is making 20% gains every day, they thought this could go on forever and jumped with both feet, only to find the carpet pulled under from their feet. Big investors have always played small investors as cannon fodder and have gotten away with their schemes even in regulated markets like forex or the stock market. Cryptocurrencies is a new market with no proper regulations which means it is natural to expect that those who can afford to not play by the rules, most likely won’t.

Hello friends,  

It's been a while since my last post; lack of time and an urge to do more research has mainly driven me to take a break from posting ideas on TradingView. I am still in the process of doing more research and study, but I figure posting once in a while couldn't hurt. 

Since I have become recently very convinced about this, I am outlining a very possible situation with  Bitcoin -1.03%  where the  trend line  we have been on since early October breaks, reaching around a temporary low of $5000. This is examined on the  daily chart , since this is one of the best charts to examine trends of this size. I have to first and foremost say that I am not trying to spread fear, I know many people do not like to hear  bearish  ideas, but  technical analysis  is ultimately a rational exercise, and I feel that possibilities with very strong signs should be explored. 

There are a few things to look at, but I first want to talk about the big picture with, long-term  support and resistance  lines. I think most people can agree that there was a very significant downtrending resistance line that began from the peak of the  ATH 0.63%  in late December, to the low of around $6400 (thick red line). After the break from that line, it seems we moved into a sideways trend, bouncing back and forth between an emerging downtrending resistance line (light red) and a support line that we seem to have been respecting since mid-October (light green); at least this appears to be the case with the lows, where the angle's effectiveness appears very strongly. Finally, based on previous bounces, we can establish a support of around $5000-$5300 (I've thus created a small  support zone  around that range, in dark green), as well as lower supports around $3200 and $2000 (though I do not believe these will be reached, in dark green).   

Now, onto the analysis - it's no secret that  Bitcoin -1.03%  has been squeezing in, ready for a significant move either upwards or downwards. Initially I considered the upwards move to be more likely due to the significant media attention cryptocurrency has been receiving, but after viewing previous market cycles of  Bitcoin -1.03%  (check 2013), it seems clear to me that the  bearish  scenario of closing in on the market cycle is very likely, and should at the very least be prepared for with proper risk management. According to Dow Theory, which is said to have laid the foundations of modern  technical analysis , history repeats itself, and this is a situation where we forced to consider this. 

Should we break from the line, we will likely fall straight down to the $5000-$5000 area, where we will shoot back up and bounce towards around $6700 or so (maybe a little less). From there one, we will likely enter a sideways trend, which we will continue until we see higher highs and higher lows and parabolic movement returns, which could lead to us challenging the all-time high, and hitting $35k-$50k. 

NOTE: I seem to have reached the max character limit for this section of the idea, so I will continue my text below.

Comment:
					Onto the short-term: 


Scenario A: 

The reason why I have drawn this movement into a pennant is this way, is simply because we have been moving through this ascending triangle for quite a while now (May 23rd to today). I don't think that the pattern will be sufficient to directly lead into a strong sell-off, but we should consider that the size of ascending triangle suggests a small movement downwards at the very least, which can create a higher low, and thus move into position into a bearish pennant. Why would a bearish pennant occur here and not have a bounce to $8500-$8700? The reason is in positioning - the huge downtrend (May 5th to May 26th) creates a very nice flagpole in which it hits around the $5000 area very perfectly, and thus I would not be surprised if this happens. 

Second reason: on the Stoch RSI indicator on the daily chart, it appears to be dangerously high, which would suggest it being oversold. For the most part, it seems to have called lows and highs, at least to some extent. This overdrawn movement may very well have increased the likelyhood of Bitcoin being oversold. This could suggest that this is the last step into a sharp downturn, but this does not preclude Situation B. Volume has also been steadily decreasing, but this is the case with any sort of consolidation, I believe. 

Finally, the lines I have drawn below the triangle are simply bounces that I think seem fairly reasonable. The length from to support to the lines correlate with the length of the flagpole, of course, though it may seem chopped off due to the huge line from the long-term support downwards. 


Scenario B: 

This is much simpler, Bitcoin hits the upper resistance line, bounces off, challenges the lower support line, and we potentially see a break, and the rest unfolds from there. 


----------------------------------------------------------------------- 


With all this being said, do not fear if you are hoping for more parabolic movement - this likely will not be the end, and will simply be the set up for a long, drawn out sideways movement until the first signs of bullish activity begin and we start all over again. If you are longing around here, please consider using risk management, prepare for every possibility. If you are shorting, the same applies. 

Please trade with care. I wish the best to all traders!

Comment:
					This really is a very minor note, but I just want to emphasize that the rising wedge (which I erroneously refer to as an ascending triangle, a bad habit I have) entering a bearish pennant is more based on intuition than anything. Also, this pennant is mainly based on the conservative assumption that the break will happen at 7900, if it happens at 7700 where we seem to be general resistance, the pennant would look something like this:

Jun 7




I am Mid term-bullish on  BTC -1.03%  going into the end of this week, but looking to get into the market on a pull back to occur before I get in to the market.  The jury is still out as to whether this weekly bear trend is ready to turn around.  

We can see that both the  RSI  and  MFI  are both  Bullish  on the daily having bottomed when reaching oversold on both at c. $7k support where we found our longer term  trend line . 

We are currently in the process of meeting the Tenkan (blue line) as I write this, so in the very short term, I am looking for a pull back to $7550 range for an entry.  One of the main reasons for this is that on the 4hour timeframes we are close to completing an edge to edge trade so the risk reward doesn’t fit my profile, however a break out from the cloud or above the Tenkan around $7777 will make me enter the market. 

The  RSI  and  MFI  have both been excellent indicators in this bear market.  Whenever  RSI  has gone above the 60 and the  MFI  80; its time to exit the market from a  bullish  trade and consider shorting as it progresses higher.   

Based on the  RSI ,  MFI  trends and the fact that we will run into the Kijun at just around $8-8.2k, I will be scalling out at this  bearish  confluence level to start looking for pull backs and reassessment as i believe it to be a key point as  

Best case scenario this trade would yield a 10% return before leverage. 
This is for illustrative purposes only, please DYOR and goodluck with your trading.

So the pullback trade that we were looking at worked out & has made it's way back to the neckline level of structure. We are now at what i like to call a ""decision point"" Essentially IF price is able to violate this current level od structure THEN we're likely to continue to our next price projection.  

Something that a lot of newer traders don't understand is that when it comes to bigger moves, the market will often provide multiple opportunities to get involved. For those who don't rush and for those who don't get discouraged. If you perform consistent analysis you can often find multiple ways to involve yourself in a trade even if you missed the first strike.

My best idea ever, taking some time off the last 2 days :) The whales just continue to play their little games by squeezing leveraged short and long positions out of the market. Can't play them, it's just too easy. Maybe it's time we retail traders stand together, combine our  volume  and use their own game against them. Yeah, maybe we could even make a blockbuster movie about this :) I love me some science fiction :) LOL  

My last update of the previous analysis i showed 2 important support levels where the price could bounce up from. The first support around 7350 did the trick and the price got pushed back to 7700. From that point on i told my members that i thought i was seeing distribution, but it was still very confusing to figure out what was going on. TA was showing  bullish  signs, that  bull flag  was very strong and was even turning slowly up and was about to squeeze upwards. But of course out of no where the price got dumped, the move we saw a few hours ago. After that 200 point drop the price got pushed up again to 7700 like that dump was a glitch. If your a whale, why not push out leveraged traders and take your money while your accumulating or distributing. It's like a bonus, like the cherry on top :)  

Anyway, in this chart we can see allot of similarities of what is going on. As you know i have been saying i am still  bearish  for the medium term, but i just could not say what was going to happen on the short term. 2 days ago after we finally dropped out of that  wedge , i said we would have 2 options.  
- Break those 2 support levels from the last update of my previous chart (73xx and 71xx) 
- Make a higher low at those same support levels and make another move up above the high.  
 
As we can see in the chart, the  fractal  is not 100% identical so it's no guarantee that the 7700 high we just saw is the high already and that we start to move down. But based on this  fractal , i don't want to see the price get above the 7800/7900. This  fractal  confirms my  bearish  view as well. That's why TA is so great, you can turn any chart to fit your view :). 

Even without this  fractal , i just give it a very small chance that 7K price action is the fundament of a low to start another bull rally, i just highly doubt that. I want to see more  volume  to begin with and at least  double bottom  kind of formation. So the minimum i expect is a test of the 7100/6900in the coming week or 2. But the movement i have in mind for the med term is a drop below the 7K to form a big V shape low. If we get to see that, than i might even become  bullish  for the rest of the year :).  

As long as the price stays above the 73xx, we have to assume the bulls are still in control and we should see another wave up. So for me the 73xx is an important turning point.

Comment:
					At the moment it looks like bulls are trying to push higher, this bull flag/triangle is still very strong. So no sign of weakness yet! First small sign would be a drop below 7620/7600. Bulls need to break 7700

Comment:
					This is my bigger picture, think this bearish triangle is still 100% in play. I think if bulls can't break the 7800/7900 the bearish version is probably going to happen. Can't say HOW it will go, this blue line is just a guess. But a big V shape low would be the most bullish for the long term. I still think we are seeing distribution here. The only way this idea can be countered, is through a big increase of buying volume, if that doesn't happen, i think it's only a matter of time.

					Lower time frame we can see a new upwards channel and maybe even a rising wedge. From the looks of it, it's slowly going down to test the support line again. Depending on what will happen there we can make a better prediction for the rest of the day.

					What a surprise, nothing has changed :) 

The price took a small dump but the volume was low so no real read on what the intent was. So we might see another move up, if we start to see a small pump that takes out the 7800, be aware of a fake breakout. The blue line is a possibility of what the move could look like IF we move up and if the breakout fails. If that happens than we will probably get confirmation if the price breaks the 7600ish. If we break the 7800 it should stay above the 7700 to confirm another move up. Not much more to say about what's going on.

163,1528359434.0,Taiwan_Bear,2618 (Double top & 0.618 pull-back) - do not miss it!!,"
In the last couple of TAs I have mentioned the “2618 pattern” and have been asked what 2618 means. Sorry for taking it so long as it took me quite a while to put everything altogether. But, as promised, I have explained below the rules and trade setups for the 2618 pattern.  

What are the rules/setups/steps for 2618?  
1.	Form a  double top  (Note #1)  
2.	Neckline has to be broken  
3.	After price found support at point (b), wait for pull back to 0.618 fib retracement of (a)(b)  
4.	After price retraced to 0.618, look for confluence and sell (eg. Structures,  trendlines  ,  double top  on a lower time frame,  rsi  divergence,  bearish pin bar  ,  inside bar  break down etc.) (Note #2)  
5.	Stop loss to be set above  double top 
6.	Set Take Profit levels (Note #3)  

Note #1 ( Double top ):  
The first step for the formation of 2618 is to form a  double top  at key resistance levels. Why at key resistance levels? Because we want to avoid fake double tops which can occur occasionally.  

There are some variations between various resources (books, websites) regarding the definitions of “double top”. The main differences occur where:  
a)	Some said for a  double top  to be valid, the wick of the 2nd top cannot exceed the wick of the 1st top; whereas, others said:  
b)	The wick of the 2nd top can exceed the wick of the 1st top but the candle close of the 2nd top CANNOT exceed the wick of the 1st top; or  
c)	The wick of the 2nd top can exceed the wick of the 1st top and the candle close of the 2nd top CAN exceed the wick of the 1st top; or  
d)	The wick of the 2nd top meets at least the candle close of the 1st top; or  
e)	The body of the 2nd top cannot exceed the body of the 1st top  

Personally, I would say all the above definitions work just fine although I do prefer definition a) because it means that the selling pressure is strong and the bulls fail to make a higher high. When there is a higher high formed in a downtrend, it can mean the downtrend has reversed and therefore you might not want to sell when the price pulls back to the 0.618 fib retracement.  

Note #2 ( 0.618 retracement ):  
When the price pulls back to 0.618, it does not mean to sell straight away. There must be more than one reason to sell other than the 0.618 retrace. The more reasons the better. In this example, you can see there are certainly structures (key resistance levels) at the 0.618 retrace. As well, there was a  double top  formed on the lower time frame. Consequently, you can sell.  

After  BTC -1.03%  hit the 0.618 retrace the first time, the price dropped from $9735 to $8650. but quickly bounced back to the 0.618 retrace level. That was a second & better opportunity to sell. Not only did  BTC -1.03%  form a  double top  on the larger time frame, but also with a  bearish  divergence on the 4hr time frame. Accordingly, you have more reasons to sell.  

Note #3 (Set take profit)  
Same as the rules of “Double top”, there are some variations as to which price level should you take profits. Personally, I would stick to the below:  
1)	First, take profit when risk/reward ratio hits 1:1 (recommend to take 30% - 50% profits and adjust the SL of the remaining positions to break-even)  
2)	When price hits the same price level as the low after the neckline is broken ((b) point in this example)  
3)	When price hits 1.272 fib extension of (a)(b)  
4)	When price hits point (d) (using  AB=CD  pattern. If you are not sure what the rules of  AB=CD  are, you can refer to my previous TA in which I have attached the link below)  
5)	If in a one-way market (heavily bearish/bullish), you can always keep 10% to 20% of your positions and take profits when risk/reward ratio hits 1:5 or even 1:10

 BTC -1.03%  is on the verge of breaking to a daily higher high on the bounce if the bulls can see a push this morning. 
If we reject from here the daily will form a lower high and we will see a tightening pattern within the highlighted  support and resistance  lines.  
Important for the bulls to show up or we could stay in this range into tomorrow.  
Healthy consolidation after the most recent bull move and the 15 min chart needs to change the trend.  
Also look to  EMA  12 support on the 4 hour and hourly.  
Another morning like yesterday with the bulls comfortable as worst case, we likely stay in the tightening pattern if bulls cannot prove themselves.

The current situation of  Bitcoin -1.03%  is quite difficult. We are on a clear treshold. A lot of traders are saying that we are on a clear downtrend, but the same amount of people are claiming that we will have our reversal soon. 

This article tries to sum up all important information you have to need! 

1: Retracement of a parabolic uptrend: 
There is a rule of thumb for the retracement of a parabolic uptrend. We should retrace to approx. the 0.786  Fibonacci Retracement  +/- 10%! 
Depending where we start the count, we are already in that target. Although both ways (blue and red) have still some space for a further downwave! 







2: The bloody support of Bitcoin: 
The average cost of mining one  bitcoin -1.03%  are at USA/Russia approx. 4700$ and at 3100$ for china! 
A drop below a target of 4700$ would be savage. Nevertheless, i can't image that we will hit that target. 







3: Manipulation of  Bitcoin -1.03%  and the Bart Simpson Pattern: 
A friend of mine found some unusual patterns in the orderbooks of several exchanges: 
https://twitter.com/CryptoSyndrome 
Altcoins are manipulated on a daily basis. It seems that  bitcoin -1.03%  is now affected to this too, which causes all these 3-5% pump and dumps. 
Thus, we are forming all the time the Bartin Simpsons Patterns. 

4: Similarity to 2014: 
Bitcoin -1.03%  now: 






Bitcoin -1.03%  2014: 







5: Deminishing downtrend and a strong support 
If we see the falling  wedges  as the force of the downtrend, then the force is diminishing! 
Furthermore we have strong support which is holding now for the 4th time! 







6: The Indicators 
Having a look at the indicators at 2D, we have a good potential for an upwave now. 
The  volume  is deminishing which should indicate a breakout soon. 
The  MACD  is about to cross, the  RSI  was slightly overbought and is heading up like the  Stoch .  RSI . 
The 200  EMA  is slighty under the current price and act as a support. 

7: The symetrical Triangle 
The theory says, that we should have in a  sym -1.72% . triangle 5 times an  ABC  wave. The waves are not perfect, but we can construct them. 






As you can see, the last four ABC-Waves formed always a 1:1 extention, which indicates that we have finished wave 5. 

8: A possible Head and Shoulders 
Even if this is not the most perfect  Head and Shoulders  Pattern, it's still valid! 
We are currently at the neckline, which is a strong and important resistance. Breaking upwards should indicate a good uptrend. 







9: The magic  6th 0.00%  of the month 






Suprisingly we have on every  6th 0.00%  of the month a reversal. Why is that??? 
One reason could be the  CME Group Futures  with dates for the settlements always nearby the  6th 0.00%  of the month! 
http://www.cmegroup.com 

10: Longterm  Bullish  TA 
The whole pattern could be seen as a big  bullish pennant . 







11: Shortterm  Bullish  TA 
Leading diagonal  starting wave1 of an  Elliott Wave , since we have now an impulse wave, after the 5x  ABC  pattern inside the triangle is finished. 
Our target should be at the top of the triangle nearby 8600-8800$. 







12: Longterm  Bearish  TA 
We also can argue, that we are currenty in an downtrend and the  sym -1.72% . triangle just continuing the trend. 
Our target should be nearby 6000$ which is also a finished downwards  Elliott Wave .

Nothing is happening in the market:  volatility  has become extinct and coins' trading fallen out of fashion. Range-bound bots and robotic humans absolutely prosper in this environment. The price was unable to break the 7700 threshold. For me this is a  bearish  signal. Indicators provide mixed signals, so let's examine wave structure. The move from May 29 is a  3-wave -0.12%  correction within a larger downtrend. A price drop below 7500 would confirm this scenario.

					Impulse Wave Truncation (Truncated Fifth) - 
Truncated 5th wave is when the market has become so over-extended in Wave 3 that there is not much force left for the impulse wave to come to a proper completion. So when this happens, there is a chance that the last wave of the impulse, Wave 5, will not reach the end of Wave 3 before the market starts correcting in the opposite direction. At this point, the market is just too exhausted. This condition is often called a “failure” or a “Truncation.”

I can see many people still believe that we are going inside a  descending triangle . I also believed this in my idea that i shard on may 1st: 



 

Things can change so quickly and if we didn't adapt to the changes then someone will. That's why i believe that we have to be in fast adapt mode in this market. Doesn't mean that you need to change without checking yourself. I try to find 2-3 confirmations before i change my idea on something. This includes pattern changes, trend changes etc 

There are 21 corrective wave patterns in EW which is categorized into major 3 corrective wave patterns: 

Zigzag  (5-3-5) 
Flat (3-3-5) 
Triangle (3-3-3-3-3) 

And other patterns are combinations of the above which is:  

Double three (A combination of two corrective patterns above) 
Triple three (A combination of three corrective patterns above) 

So what i can see now is that we are in two double three combination corrective wave pattern: 








More info here:  

https://elliottwave-forecast.com/elliott-wave-theory/#corrective-waves 

Confirmations: 

1. Wave ((i)) of C is 1.6k and ((v)) is going to be completed below the triangle 
2. Wave (E) of the triangle can't go beyond the triangle.  
3. This has happened twice before in 2013 & 2015 

Each wave  got 3 subwaves (a,b &c) inside and we are in the subwave c of ((y)) of Y which is an impulsive wave. 

Impulsive waves: 1,3,5,a,c 
Corrective waves: 2,4,b 

Normal Fibo Ratios for these waves are: 

wave 2 = 0.5 - 0.8 of wave 1  
wave 3 = 1.236 - 1.618 of wave 1  
wave 4 = 0.5 - 0.618 of wave 3  
wave 5 = 0.618 - 1 of wave 1  
wave B = 0.5 - 0.8 of wave A  
wave C = 0.618 - 1.236 of wave A  

Now if you check what happened in subwave a of ((y)) of Y you can see that: 

Wave (i) of a: 985$ 
Wave (ii) of a: 434$  
Wave ( iii -0.63% ) of a: 1207$  
Wave (iv) of a: 691$ [~0.618 of Wave ( iii -0.63% )] 
Wave (v) of a: 950$  








I have seen  BTC -1.03%  impulsive waves fibo ratios almost the same as the previous impulsive wave fibo ratios. 
Now if you apply the same for the last wave C of (E) this is what you get: 

Wave ((i)) of c: 1587$ 
Wave ((ii)) of c  = 793$ 
Wave (( iii -0.63% )) of c  = 1961$ 
Wave ((iv)) of c [~0.618 of Wave (( iii -0.63% ))] = 1212$ 
Wave ((v)) of c  = 1587$ 








Also note that Wave ((iv)) might not retrace upto 0.618 of Wave (( iii -0.63% )) as everyone will be in panic mode by that time so minimum retracement would be around 0.386 of Wave (( iii -0.63% )) which is around 756$ and this is why i can see it goes down to 5k level or little bit more towards 4.7k which is the lowest level of the  support zone  (orange dotted lines) 








So 3 Possible Support lines for reversal would be 

1. Blue: 5800 - 6100 (Only possible if Wave ((v)) is truncated) 
2. Orange: 4700 - 5000 (This is most likely where we heading)  
3. Red: 4100 - 4400 (Only possible if Wave (( iii -0.63% )) is extended)

 Bitcoin -1.03%  has recently developed an interesting pattern of completing a  bullish  and  bearish  cycle on the sixth of every month in an alternating order. As we can see in the chart above, a fall is followed by a rise. This has happened twice before and is expected to happen again now on the  6th 0.00%  of June, 2018. This time  Bitcoin -1.03%  will finish a  bearish  cycle and I expected to begin the next  bullish  cycle at least till the end of  6th 0.00%  of July, 2018. 

This pattern of rise and fall is also supported by other patterns on the chart that signal a  bullish  reversal. The support line has also held firmly and if this pattern of alternating rise and fall ensues,  Bitcoin -1.03%  could very well make new highs by the end of the year. The  RSI  is recovering from oversold levels and has now approached a normal.  Bitcoin -1.03%  is currently at a favorable point for  bullish  entries. The price broke a long term resistance as it break past the downtrend line in April, 2018. This was a big accomplishment for the bulls but the lack of confidence pulled the price back to the support line. Currently, the price is just above the support line and appears to be all set for a  bullish  comeback but the reality is, there are not enough bulls in the market. 

The past few months have been devastating for the price of  Bitcoin -1.03%  ( BTC -1.03% ) and a lot of investors are still running scared. Institutional investors are looking for more clarity regarding regulations concerning cryptocurrencies and also safer ways to invest and store their coins. As for retail investors, most of them comprise of first time investors who have never traded any financial asset before. So, when they saw that  Bitcoin -1.03%  ( BTC -1.03% ) is making 20% gains every day, they thought this could go on forever and jumped with both feet, only to find the carpet pulled under from their feet. Big investors have always played small investors as cannon fodder and have gotten away with their schemes even in regulated markets like forex or the stock market. Cryptocurrencies is a new market with no proper regulations which means it is natural to expect that those who can afford to not play by the rules, most likely won’t.

Hello friends,  

It's been a while since my last post; lack of time and an urge to do more research has mainly driven me to take a break from posting ideas on TradingView. I am still in the process of doing more research and study, but I figure posting once in a while couldn't hurt. 

Since I have become recently very convinced about this, I am outlining a very possible situation with  Bitcoin -1.03%  where the  trend line  we have been on since early October breaks, reaching around a temporary low of $5000. This is examined on the  daily chart , since this is one of the best charts to examine trends of this size. I have to first and foremost say that I am not trying to spread fear, I know many people do not like to hear  bearish  ideas, but  technical analysis  is ultimately a rational exercise, and I feel that possibilities with very strong signs should be explored. 

There are a few things to look at, but I first want to talk about the big picture with, long-term  support and resistance  lines. I think most people can agree that there was a very significant downtrending resistance line that began from the peak of the  ATH 0.63%  in late December, to the low of around $6400 (thick red line). After the break from that line, it seems we moved into a sideways trend, bouncing back and forth between an emerging downtrending resistance line (light red) and a support line that we seem to have been respecting since mid-October (light green); at least this appears to be the case with the lows, where the angle's effectiveness appears very strongly. Finally, based on previous bounces, we can establish a support of around $5000-$5300 (I've thus created a small  support zone  around that range, in dark green), as well as lower supports around $3200 and $2000 (though I do not believe these will be reached, in dark green).   

Now, onto the analysis - it's no secret that  Bitcoin -1.03%  has been squeezing in, ready for a significant move either upwards or downwards. Initially I considered the upwards move to be more likely due to the significant media attention cryptocurrency has been receiving, but after viewing previous market cycles of  Bitcoin -1.03%  (check 2013), it seems clear to me that the  bearish  scenario of closing in on the market cycle is very likely, and should at the very least be prepared for with proper risk management. According to Dow Theory, which is said to have laid the foundations of modern  technical analysis , history repeats itself, and this is a situation where we forced to consider this. 

Should we break from the line, we will likely fall straight down to the $5000-$5000 area, where we will shoot back up and bounce towards around $6700 or so (maybe a little less). From there one, we will likely enter a sideways trend, which we will continue until we see higher highs and higher lows and parabolic movement returns, which could lead to us challenging the all-time high, and hitting $35k-$50k. 

NOTE: I seem to have reached the max character limit for this section of the idea, so I will continue my text below.

The reason why I have drawn this movement into a pennant is this way, is simply because we have been moving through this ascending triangle for quite a while now (May 23rd to today). I don't think that the pattern will be sufficient to directly lead into a strong sell-off, but we should consider that the size of ascending triangle suggests a small movement downwards at the very least, which can create a higher low, and thus move into position into a bearish pennant. Why would a bearish pennant occur here and not have a bounce to $8500-$8700? The reason is in positioning - the huge downtrend (May 5th to May 26th) creates a very nice flagpole in which it hits around the $5000 area very perfectly, and thus I would not be surprised if this happens. 

Second reason: on the Stoch RSI indicator on the daily chart, it appears to be dangerously high, which would suggest it being oversold. For the most part, it seems to have called lows and highs, at least to some extent. This overdrawn movement may very well have increased the likelyhood of Bitcoin being oversold. This could suggest that this is the last step into a sharp downturn, but this does not preclude Situation B. Volume has also been steadily decreasing, but this is the case with any sort of consolidation, I believe. 

Finally, the lines I have drawn below the triangle are simply bounces that I think seem fairly reasonable. The length from to support to the lines correlate with the length of the flagpole, of course, though it may seem chopped off due to the huge line from the long-term support downwards. 


Scenario B: 

This is much simpler, Bitcoin hits the upper resistance line, bounces off, challenges the lower support line, and we potentially see a break, and the rest unfolds from there. 


----------------------------------------------------------------------- 


With all this being said, do not fear if you are hoping for more parabolic movement - this likely will not be the end, and will simply be the set up for a long, drawn out sideways movement until the first signs of bullish activity begin and we start all over again. If you are longing around here, please consider using risk management, prepare for every possibility. If you are shorting, the same applies. 

Please trade with care. I wish the best to all traders!

Comment:
					This really is a very minor note, but I just want to emphasize that the rising wedge (which I erroneously refer to as an ascending triangle, a bad habit I have) entering a bearish pennant is more based on intuition than anything. Also, this pennant is mainly based on the conservative assumption that the break will happen at 7900, if it happens at 7700 where we seem to be general resistance, the pennant would look something like this:

I am Mid term-bullish on  BTC -1.03%  going into the end of this week, but looking to get into the market on a pull back to occur before I get in to the market.  The jury is still out as to whether this weekly bear trend is ready to turn around.  

We can see that both the  RSI  and  MFI  are both  Bullish  on the daily having bottomed when reaching oversold on both at c. $7k support where we found our longer term  trend line . 

We are currently in the process of meeting the Tenkan (blue line) as I write this, so in the very short term, I am looking for a pull back to $7550 range for an entry.  One of the main reasons for this is that on the 4hour timeframes we are close to completing an edge to edge trade so the risk reward doesn’t fit my profile, however a break out from the cloud or above the Tenkan around $7777 will make me enter the market. 

The  RSI  and  MFI  have both been excellent indicators in this bear market.  Whenever  RSI  has gone above the 60 and the  MFI  80; its time to exit the market from a  bullish  trade and consider shorting as it progresses higher.   

Based on the  RSI ,  MFI  trends and the fact that we will run into the Kijun at just around $8-8.2k, I will be scalling out at this  bearish  confluence level to start looking for pull backs and reassessment as i believe it to be a key point as  

Best case scenario this trade would yield a 10% return before leverage. 
This is for illustrative purposes only, please DYOR and goodluck with your trading.

So the pullback trade that we were looking at worked out & has made it's way back to the neckline level of structure. We are now at what i like to call a ""decision point"" Essentially IF price is able to violate this current level od structure THEN we're likely to continue to our next price projection.  

Something that a lot of newer traders don't understand is that when it comes to bigger moves, the market will often provide multiple opportunities to get involved. For those who don't rush and for those who don't get discouraged. If you perform consistent analysis you can often find multiple ways to involve yourself in a trade even if you missed the first strike.

This is the way markets move, If you question my charting check my previous posts. Its as simple as pie. We are going down, How long and how far is too soon to say. Here is a chart that we can understand the future price action and where to buy back. Before you guys start blasting my comment section with the time and how it may not be right thats correct. I am not calculating the time I'm just making a technical drawing of the directions that we will see in the next few months.  

Recent price action has clear signs of wash trading / market manipulation fud and lots of nonsense. Its hard to prove almost impossible so as a trader we just need to deal with it. Ideally the situation you are supposed to trade are critical break up and break down points to enter the trade. Dont enter or exit dumb trades and lose money. As an experienced trader you should be looking for shorts, I would not consider a long unless we are over $10-12k

I am never good with words so instead of writing paragraphs of clarification to justify my call for SHORT since my last posting, I have explained everything on my chart with the least words possible using Fibonacci. It does not matter how popular  Bitcoin -1.03%  has become, or how deep it has disrupted the financial sector, or how many institutional investors have come to invest in it -- the psychology behind a market cycle does not change. 

I don't really encourage anyone to short  Bitcoin -1.03% , but in all honesty, don't expect the bulls to fly anytime soon. Like I said before, this correction that we are having right now is the ""MOTHER OF ALL CORRECTIONS"" after a 4-year-long bull cycle since the 2013 correction... and we are just halfway through.

My best idea ever, taking some time off the last 2 days :) The whales just continue to play their little games by squeezing leveraged short and long positions out of the market. Can't play them, it's just too easy. Maybe it's time we retail traders stand together, combine our  volume  and use their own game against them. Yeah, maybe we could even make a blockbuster movie about this :) I love me some science fiction :) LOL  

My last update of the previous analysis i showed 2 important support levels where the price could bounce up from. The first support around 7350 did the trick and the price got pushed back to 7700. From that point on i told my members that i thought i was seeing distribution, but it was still very confusing to figure out what was going on. TA was showing  bullish  signs, that  bull flag  was very strong and was even turning slowly up and was about to squeeze upwards. But of course out of no where the price got dumped, the move we saw a few hours ago. After that 200 point drop the price got pushed up again to 7700 like that dump was a glitch. If your a whale, why not push out leveraged traders and take your money while your accumulating or distributing. It's like a bonus, like the cherry on top :)  

Anyway, in this chart we can see allot of similarities of what is going on. As you know i have been saying i am still  bearish  for the medium term, but i just could not say what was going to happen on the short term. 2 days ago after we finally dropped out of that  wedge , i said we would have 2 options.  
- Break those 2 support levels from the last update of my previous chart (73xx and 71xx) 
- Make a higher low at those same support levels and make another move up above the high.  
 
As we can see in the chart, the  fractal  is not 100% identical so it's no guarantee that the 7700 high we just saw is the high already and that we start to move down. But based on this  fractal , i don't want to see the price get above the 7800/7900. This  fractal  confirms my  bearish  view as well. That's why TA is so great, you can turn any chart to fit your view :). 

Even without this  fractal , i just give it a very small chance that 7K price action is the fundament of a low to start another bull rally, i just highly doubt that. I want to see more  volume  to begin with and at least  double bottom  kind of formation. So the minimum i expect is a test of the 7100/6900in the coming week or 2. But the movement i have in mind for the med term is a drop below the 7K to form a big V shape low. If we get to see that, than i might even become  bullish  for the rest of the year :).  

As long as the price stays above the 73xx, we have to assume the bulls are still in control and we should see another wave up. So for me the 73xx is an important turning point.

Comment:
					This is my bigger picture, think this bearish triangle is still 100% in play. I think if bulls can't break the 7800/7900 the bearish version is probably going to happen. Can't say HOW it will go, this blue line is just a guess. But a big V shape low would be the most bullish for the long term. I still think we are seeing distribution here. The only way this idea can be countered, is through a big increase of buying volume, if that doesn't happen, i think it's only a matter of time.

The price took a small dump but the volume was low so no real read on what the intent was. So we might see another move up, if we start to see a small pump that takes out the 7800, be aware of a fake breakout. The blue line is a possibility of what the move could look like IF we move up and if the breakout fails. If that happens than we will probably get confirmation if the price breaks the 7600ish. If we break the 7800 it should stay above the 7700 to confirm another move up. Not much more to say about what's going on.

181,1528359434.0,Taiwan_Bear,2618 (Double top & 0.618 pull-back) - do not miss it!!,"
In the last couple of TAs I have mentioned the “2618 pattern” and have been asked what 2618 means. Sorry for taking it so long as it took me quite a while to put everything altogether. But, as promised, I have explained below the rules and trade setups for the 2618 pattern.  

What are the rules/setups/steps for 2618?  
1.	Form a  double top  (Note #1)  
2.	Neckline has to be broken  
3.	After price found support at point (b), wait for pull back to 0.618 fib retracement of (a)(b)  
4.	After price retraced to 0.618, look for confluence and sell (eg. Structures,  trendlines  ,  double top  on a lower time frame,  rsi  divergence,  bearish pin bar  ,  inside bar  break down etc.) (Note #2)  
5.	Stop loss to be set above  double top 
6.	Set Take Profit levels (Note #3)  

Note #1 ( Double top ):  
The first step for the formation of 2618 is to form a  double top  at key resistance levels. Why at key resistance levels? Because we want to avoid fake double tops which can occur occasionally.  

There are some variations between various resources (books, websites) regarding the definitions of “double top”. The main differences occur where:  
a)	Some said for a  double top  to be valid, the wick of the 2nd top cannot exceed the wick of the 1st top; whereas, others said:  
b)	The wick of the 2nd top can exceed the wick of the 1st top but the candle close of the 2nd top CANNOT exceed the wick of the 1st top; or  
c)	The wick of the 2nd top can exceed the wick of the 1st top and the candle close of the 2nd top CAN exceed the wick of the 1st top; or  
d)	The wick of the 2nd top meets at least the candle close of the 1st top; or  
e)	The body of the 2nd top cannot exceed the body of the 1st top  

Personally, I would say all the above definitions work just fine although I do prefer definition a) because it means that the selling pressure is strong and the bulls fail to make a higher high. When there is a higher high formed in a downtrend, it can mean the downtrend has reversed and therefore you might not want to sell when the price pulls back to the 0.618 fib retracement.  

Note #2 ( 0.618 retracement ):  
When the price pulls back to 0.618, it does not mean to sell straight away. There must be more than one reason to sell other than the 0.618 retrace. The more reasons the better. In this example, you can see there are certainly structures (key resistance levels) at the 0.618 retrace. As well, there was a  double top  formed on the lower time frame. Consequently, you can sell.  

After  BTC -1.03%  hit the 0.618 retrace the first time, the price dropped from $9735 to $8650. but quickly bounced back to the 0.618 retrace level. That was a second & better opportunity to sell. Not only did  BTC -1.03%  form a  double top  on the larger time frame, but also with a  bearish  divergence on the 4hr time frame. Accordingly, you have more reasons to sell.  

Note #3 (Set take profit)  
Same as the rules of “Double top”, there are some variations as to which price level should you take profits. Personally, I would stick to the below:  
1)	First, take profit when risk/reward ratio hits 1:1 (recommend to take 30% - 50% profits and adjust the SL of the remaining positions to break-even)  
2)	When price hits the same price level as the low after the neckline is broken ((b) point in this example)  
3)	When price hits 1.272 fib extension of (a)(b)  
4)	When price hits point (d) (using  AB=CD  pattern. If you are not sure what the rules of  AB=CD  are, you can refer to my previous TA in which I have attached the link below)  
5)	If in a one-way market (heavily bearish/bullish), you can always keep 10% to 20% of your positions and take profits when risk/reward ratio hits 1:5 or even 1:10

 BTC -1.03%  is on the verge of breaking to a daily higher high on the bounce if the bulls can see a push this morning. 
If we reject from here the daily will form a lower high and we will see a tightening pattern within the highlighted  support and resistance  lines.  
Important for the bulls to show up or we could stay in this range into tomorrow.  
Healthy consolidation after the most recent bull move and the 15 min chart needs to change the trend.  
Also look to  EMA  12 support on the 4 hour and hourly.

The current situation of  Bitcoin -1.03%  is quite difficult. We are on a clear treshold. A lot of traders are saying that we are on a clear downtrend, but the same amount of people are claiming that we will have our reversal soon. 

This article tries to sum up all important information you have to need! 

1: Retracement of a parabolic uptrend: 
There is a rule of thumb for the retracement of a parabolic uptrend. We should retrace to approx. the 0.786  Fibonacci Retracement  +/- 10%! 
Depending where we start the count, we are already in that target. Although both ways (blue and red) have still some space for a further downwave! 







2: The bloody support of Bitcoin: 
The average cost of mining one  bitcoin -1.03%  are at USA/Russia approx. 4700$ and at 3100$ for china! 
A drop below a target of 4700$ would be savage. Nevertheless, i can't image that we will hit that target. 







3: Manipulation of  Bitcoin -1.03%  and the Bart Simpson Pattern: 
A friend of mine found some unusual patterns in the orderbooks of several exchanges: 
https://twitter.com/CryptoSyndrome 
Altcoins are manipulated on a daily basis. It seems that  bitcoin -1.03%  is now affected to this too, which causes all these 3-5% pump and dumps. 
Thus, we are forming all the time the Bartin Simpsons Patterns. 

4: Similarity to 2014: 
Bitcoin -1.03%  now: 






Bitcoin -1.03%  2014: 







5: Deminishing downtrend and a strong support 
If we see the falling  wedges  as the force of the downtrend, then the force is diminishing! 
Furthermore we have strong support which is holding now for the 4th time! 







6: The Indicators 
Having a look at the indicators at 2D, we have a good potential for an upwave now. 
The  volume  is deminishing which should indicate a breakout soon. 
The  MACD  is about to cross, the  RSI  was slightly overbought and is heading up like the  Stoch .  RSI . 
The 200  EMA  is slighty under the current price and act as a support. 

7: The symetrical Triangle 
The theory says, that we should have in a  sym -1.72% . triangle 5 times an  ABC  wave. The waves are not perfect, but we can construct them. 






As you can see, the last four ABC-Waves formed always a 1:1 extention, which indicates that we have finished wave 5. 

8: A possible Head and Shoulders 
Even if this is not the most perfect  Head and Shoulders  Pattern, it's still valid! 
We are currently at the neckline, which is a strong and important resistance. Breaking upwards should indicate a good uptrend. 







9: The magic  6th 0.00%  of the month 






Suprisingly we have on every  6th 0.00%  of the month a reversal. Why is that??? 
One reason could be the  CME Group Futures  with dates for the settlements always nearby the  6th 0.00%  of the month! 
http://www.cmegroup.com 

10: Longterm  Bullish  TA 
The whole pattern could be seen as a big  bullish pennant . 







11: Shortterm  Bullish  TA 
Leading diagonal  starting wave1 of an  Elliott Wave , since we have now an impulse wave, after the 5x  ABC  pattern inside the triangle is finished. 
Our target should be at the top of the triangle nearby 8600-8800$. 







12: Longterm  Bearish  TA 
We also can argue, that we are currenty in an downtrend and the  sym -1.72% . triangle just continuing the trend. 
Our target should be nearby 6000$ which is also a finished downwards  Elliott Wave .

Nothing is happening in the market:  volatility  has become extinct and coins' trading fallen out of fashion. Range-bound bots and robotic humans absolutely prosper in this environment. The price was unable to break the 7700 threshold. For me this is a  bearish  signal. Indicators provide mixed signals, so let's examine wave structure. The move from May 29 is a  3-wave              correction within a larger downtrend. A price drop below 7500 would confirm this scenario.

					Impulse Wave Truncation (Truncated Fifth) - 
Truncated 5th wave is when the market has become so over-extended in Wave 3 that there is not much force left for the impulse wave to come to a proper completion. So when this happens, there is a chance that the last wave of the impulse, Wave 5, will not reach the end of Wave 3 before the market starts correcting in the opposite direction. At this point, the market is just too exhausted. This condition is often called a “failure” or a “Truncation.”

I can see many people still believe that we are going inside a  descending triangle . I also believed this in my idea that i shard on may 1st: 



 

Things can change so quickly and if we didn't adapt to the changes then someone will. That's why i believe that we have to be in fast adapt mode in this market. Doesn't mean that you need to change without checking yourself. I try to find 2-3 confirmations before i change my idea on something. This includes pattern changes, trend changes etc 

There are 21 corrective wave patterns in EW which is categorized into major 3 corrective wave patterns: 

Zigzag  (5-3-5) 
Flat (3-3-5) 
Triangle (3-3-3-3-3) 

And other patterns are combinations of the above which is:  

Double three (A combination of two corrective patterns above) 
Triple three (A combination of three corrective patterns above) 

So what i can see now is that we are in two double three combination corrective wave pattern:

Confirmations: 

1. Wave ((i)) of C is 1.6k and ((v)) is going to be completed below the triangle 
2. Wave (E) of the triangle can't go beyond the triangle.  
3. This has happened twice before in 2013 & 2015 

Each wave  got 3 subwaves (a,b &c) inside and we are in the subwave c of ((y)) of Y which is an impulsive wave. 

Impulsive waves: 1,3,5,a,c 
Corrective waves: 2,4,b 

Normal Fibo Ratios for these waves are: 

wave 2 = 0.5 - 0.8 of wave 1  
wave 3 = 1.236 - 1.618 of wave 1  
wave 4 = 0.5 - 0.618 of wave 3  
wave 5 = 0.618 - 1 of wave 1  
wave B = 0.5 - 0.8 of wave A  
wave C = 0.618 - 1.236 of wave A  

Now if you check what happened in subwave a of ((y)) of Y you can see that: 

Wave (i) of a: 985$ 
Wave (ii) of a: 434$  
Wave ( iii -0.63% ) of a: 1207$  
Wave (iv) of a: 691$ [~0.618 of Wave ( iii -0.63% )] 
Wave (v) of a: 950$  








I have seen  BTC -1.03%  impulsive waves fibo ratios almost the same as the previous impulsive wave fibo ratios. 
Now if you apply the same for the last wave C of (E) this is what you get: 

Wave ((i)) of c: 1587$ 
Wave ((ii)) of c  = 793$ 
Wave (( iii -0.63% )) of c  = 1961$ 
Wave ((iv)) of c [~0.618 of Wave (( iii -0.63% ))] = 1212$ 
Wave ((v)) of c  = 1587$ 








Also note that Wave ((iv)) might not retrace upto 0.618 of Wave (( iii -0.63% )) as everyone will be in panic mode by that time so minimum retracement would be around 0.386 of Wave (( iii -0.63% )) which is around 756$ and this is why i can see it goes down to 5k level or little bit more towards 4.7k which is the lowest level of the  support zone  (orange dotted lines) 








So 3 Possible Support lines for reversal would be 

1. Blue: 5800 - 6100 (Only possible if Wave ((v)) is truncated) 
2. Orange: 4700 - 5000 (This is most likely where we heading)  
3. Red: 4100 - 4400 (Only possible if Wave (( iii -0.63% )) is extended)

 Bitcoin -1.03%  has recently developed an interesting pattern of completing a  bullish  and  bearish  cycle on the sixth of every month in an alternating order. As we can see in the chart above, a fall is followed by a rise. This has happened twice before and is expected to happen again now on the  6th 0.00%  of June, 2018. This time  Bitcoin -1.03%  will finish a  bearish  cycle and I expected to begin the next  bullish  cycle at least till the end of  6th 0.00%  of July, 2018. 

This pattern of rise and fall is also supported by other patterns on the chart that signal a  bullish  reversal. The support line has also held firmly and if this pattern of alternating rise and fall ensues,  Bitcoin -1.03%  could very well make new highs by the end of the year. The  RSI  is recovering from oversold levels and has now approached a normal.  Bitcoin -1.03%  is currently at a favorable point for  bullish  entries. The price broke a long term resistance as it break past the downtrend line in April, 2018. This was a big accomplishment for the bulls but the lack of confidence pulled the price back to the support line. Currently, the price is just above the support line and appears to be all set for a  bullish  comeback but the reality is, there are not enough bulls in the market. 

The past few months have been devastating for the price of  Bitcoin -1.03%  ( BTC -1.03% ) and a lot of investors are still running scared. Institutional investors are looking for more clarity regarding regulations concerning cryptocurrencies and also safer ways to invest and store their coins. As for retail investors, most of them comprise of first time investors who have never traded any financial asset before. So, when they saw that  Bitcoin -1.03%  ( BTC -1.03% ) is making 20% gains every day, they thought this could go on forever and jumped with both feet, only to find the carpet pulled under from their feet. Big investors have always played small investors as cannon fodder and have gotten away with their schemes even in regulated markets like forex or the stock market. Cryptocurrencies is a new market with no proper regulations which means it is natural to expect that those who can afford to not play by the rules, most likely won’t.

Hello friends,  

It's been a while since my last post; lack of time and an urge to do more research has mainly driven me to take a break from posting ideas on TradingView. I am still in the process of doing more research and study, but I figure posting once in a while couldn't hurt. 

Since I have become recently very convinced about this, I am outlining a very possible situation with  Bitcoin -1.03%  where the  trend line  we have been on since early October breaks, reaching around a temporary low of $5000. This is examined on the  daily chart , since this is one of the best charts to examine trends of this size. I have to first and foremost say that I am not trying to spread fear, I know many people do not like to hear  bearish  ideas, but  technical analysis  is ultimately a rational exercise, and I feel that possibilities with very strong signs should be explored. 

There are a few things to look at, but I first want to talk about the big picture with, long-term  support and resistance  lines. I think most people can agree that there was a very significant downtrending resistance line that began from the peak of the  ATH 0.63%  in late December, to the low of around $6400 (thick red line). After the break from that line, it seems we moved into a sideways trend, bouncing back and forth between an emerging downtrending resistance line (light red) and a support line that we seem to have been respecting since mid-October (light green); at least this appears to be the case with the lows, where the angle's effectiveness appears very strongly. Finally, based on previous bounces, we can establish a support of around $5000-$5300 (I've thus created a small  support zone  around that range, in dark green), as well as lower supports around $3200 and $2000 (though I do not believe these will be reached, in dark green).   

Now, onto the analysis - it's no secret that  Bitcoin -1.03%  has been squeezing in, ready for a significant move either upwards or downwards. Initially I considered the upwards move to be more likely due to the significant media attention cryptocurrency has been receiving, but after viewing previous market cycles of  Bitcoin -1.03%  (check 2013), it seems clear to me that the  bearish  scenario of closing in on the market cycle is very likely, and should at the very least be prepared for with proper risk management. According to Dow Theory, which is said to have laid the foundations of modern  technical analysis , history repeats itself, and this is a situation where we forced to consider this. 

Should we break from the line, we will likely fall straight down to the $5000-$5000 area, where we will shoot back up and bounce towards around $6700 or so (maybe a little less). From there one, we will likely enter a sideways trend, which we will continue until we see higher highs and higher lows and parabolic movement returns, which could lead to us challenging the all-time high, and hitting $35k-$50k. 

NOTE: I seem to have reached the max character limit for this section of the idea, so I will continue my text below.

Comment:
					Onto the short-term: 


Scenario A: 

The reason why I have drawn this movement into a pennant is this way, is simply because we have been moving through this ascending triangle for quite a while now (May 23rd to today). I don't think that the pattern will be sufficient to directly lead into a strong sell-off, but we should consider that the size of ascending triangle suggests a small movement downwards at the very least, which can create a higher low, and thus move into position into a bearish pennant. Why would a bearish pennant occur here and not have a bounce to $8500-$8700? The reason is in positioning - the huge downtrend (May 5th to May 26th) creates a very nice flagpole in which it hits around the $5000 area very perfectly, and thus I would not be surprised if this happens. 

Second reason: on the Stoch RSI indicator on the daily chart, it appears to be dangerously high, which would suggest it being oversold. For the most part, it seems to have called lows and highs, at least to some extent. This overdrawn movement may very well have increased the likelyhood of Bitcoin being oversold. This could suggest that this is the last step into a sharp downturn, but this does not preclude Situation B. Volume has also been steadily decreasing, but this is the case with any sort of consolidation, I believe. 

Finally, the lines I have drawn below the triangle are simply bounces that I think seem fairly reasonable. The length from to support to the lines correlate with the length of the flagpole, of course, though it may seem chopped off due to the huge line from the long-term support downwards. 


Scenario B: 

This is much simpler, Bitcoin hits the upper resistance line, bounces off, challenges the lower support line, and we potentially see a break, and the rest unfolds from there. 


----------------------------------------------------------------------- 


With all this being said, do not fear if you are hoping for more parabolic movement - this likely will not be the end, and will simply be the set up for a long, drawn out sideways movement until the first signs of bullish activity begin and we start all over again. If you are longing around here, please consider using risk management, prepare for every possibility. If you are shorting, the same applies. 

Please trade with care. I wish the best to all traders!

Comment:
					This really is a very minor note, but I just want to emphasize that the rising wedge (which I erroneously refer to as an ascending triangle, a bad habit I have) entering a bearish pennant is more based on intuition than anything. Also, this pennant is mainly based on the conservative assumption that the break will happen at 7900, if it happens at 7700 where we seem to be general resistance, the pennant would look something like this:

Jun 7




I am Mid term-bullish on  BTC -1.03%  going into the end of this week, but looking to get into the market on a pull back to occur before I get in to the market.  The jury is still out as to whether this weekly bear trend is ready to turn around.  

We can see that both the  RSI  and  MFI  are both  Bullish  on the daily having bottomed when reaching oversold on both at c. $7k support where we found our longer term  trend line . 

We are currently in the process of meeting the Tenkan (blue line) as I write this, so in the very short term, I am looking for a pull back to $7550 range for an entry.  One of the main reasons for this is that on the 4hour timeframes we are close to completing an edge to edge trade so the risk reward doesn’t fit my profile, however a break out from the cloud or above the Tenkan around $7777 will make me enter the market. 

The  RSI  and  MFI  have both been excellent indicators in this bear market.  Whenever  RSI  has gone above the 60 and the  MFI  80; its time to exit the market from a  bullish  trade and consider shorting as it progresses higher.   

Based on the  RSI ,  MFI  trends and the fact that we will run into the Kijun at just around $8-8.2k, I will be scalling out at this  bearish  confluence level to start looking for pull backs and reassessment as i believe it to be a key point as  

Best case scenario this trade would yield a 10% return before leverage. 
This is for illustrative purposes only, please DYOR and goodluck with your trading.

So the pullback trade that we were looking at worked out & has made it's way back to the neckline level of structure. We are now at what i like to call a ""decision point"" Essentially IF price is able to violate this current level od structure THEN we're likely to continue to our next price projection.  

Something that a lot of newer traders don't understand is that when it comes to bigger moves, the market will often provide multiple opportunities to get involved. For those who don't rush and for those who don't get discouraged. If you perform consistent analysis you can often find multiple ways to involve yourself in a trade even if you missed the first strike.

Recent price action has clear signs of wash trading / market manipulation fud and lots of nonsense. Its hard to prove almost impossible so as a trader we just need to deal with it. Ideally the situation you are supposed to trade are critical break up and break down points to enter the trade. Dont enter or exit dumb trades and lose money.

I am never good with words so instead of writing paragraphs of clarification to justify my call for SHORT since my last posting, I have explained everything on my chart with the least words possible using Fibonacci. It does not matter how popular  Bitcoin -1.03%  has become, or how deep it has disrupted the financial sector, or how many institutional investors have come to invest in it -- the psychology behind a market cycle does not change. 

I don't really encourage anyone to short  Bitcoin -1.03% , but in all honesty, don't expect the bulls to fly anytime soon.

My best idea ever, taking some time off the last 2 days :) The whales just continue to play their little games by squeezing leveraged short and long positions out of the market. Can't play them, it's just too easy. Maybe it's time we retail traders stand together, combine our  volume  and use their own game against them. Yeah, maybe we could even make a blockbuster movie about this :) I love me some science fiction :) LOL  

My last update of the previous analysis i showed 2 important support levels where the price could bounce up from. The first support around 7350 did the trick and the price got pushed back to 7700. From that point on i told my members that i thought i was seeing distribution, but it was still very confusing to figure out what was going on. TA was showing  bullish  signs, that  bull flag  was very strong and was even turning slowly up and was about to squeeze upwards. But of course out of no where the price got dumped, the move we saw a few hours ago. After that 200 point drop the price got pushed up again to 7700 like that dump was a glitch. If your a whale, why not push out leveraged traders and take your money while your accumulating or distributing. It's like a bonus, like the cherry on top :)  

Anyway, in this chart we can see allot of similarities of what is going on. As you know i have been saying i am still  bearish  for the medium term, but i just could not say what was going to happen on the short term. 2 days ago after we finally dropped out of that  wedge , i said we would have 2 options.  
- Break those 2 support levels from the last update of my previous chart (73xx and 71xx) 
- Make a higher low at those same support levels and make another move up above the high.  
 
As we can see in the chart, the  fractal  is not 100% identical so it's no guarantee that the 7700 high we just saw is the high already and that we start to move down. But based on this  fractal , i don't want to see the price get above the 7800/7900. This  fractal  confirms my  bearish  view as well. That's why TA is so great, you can turn any chart to fit your view :). 

Even without this  fractal , i just give it a very small chance that 7K price action is the fundament of a low to start another bull rally, i just highly doubt that. I want to see more  volume  to begin with and at least  double bottom  kind of formation. So the minimum i expect is a test of the 7100/6900in the coming week or 2. But the movement i have in mind for the med term is a drop below the 7K to form a big V shape low. If we get to see that, than i might even become  bullish  for the rest of the year :).  

As long as the price stays above the 73xx, we have to assume the bulls are still in control and we should see another wave up. So for me the 73xx is an important turning point.

					This is my bigger picture, think this bearish triangle is still 100% in play. I think if bulls can't break the 7800/7900 the bearish version is probably going to happen. Can't say HOW it will go, this blue line is just a guess. But a big V shape low would be the most bullish for the long term. I still think we are seeing distribution here. The only way this idea can be countered, is through a big increase of buying volume, if that doesn't happen, i think it's only a matter of time.

The price took a small dump but the volume was low so no real read on what the intent was. So we might see another move up, if we start to see a small pump that takes out the 7800, be aware of a fake breakout. The blue line is a possibility of what the move could look like IF we move up and if the breakout fails. If that happens than we will probably get confirmation if the price breaks the 7600ish. If we break the 7800 it should stay above the 7700 to confirm another move up. Not much more to say about what's going on.

199,1528359434.0,Taiwan_Bear,2618 (Double top & 0.618 pull-back) - do not miss it!!,"
In the last couple of TAs I have mentioned the “2618 pattern” and have been asked what 2618 means. Sorry for taking it so long as it took me quite a while to put everything altogether. But, as promised, I have explained below the rules and trade setups for the 2618 pattern.  

What are the rules/setups/steps for 2618?  
1.	Form a  double top  (Note #1)  
2.	Neckline has to be broken  
3.	After price found support at point (b), wait for pull back to 0.618 fib retracement of (a)(b)  
4.	After price retraced to 0.618, look for confluence and sell (eg. Structures,  trendlines  ,  double top  on a lower time frame,  rsi  divergence,  bearish pin bar  ,  inside bar  break down etc.) (Note #2)  
5.	Stop loss to be set above  double top 
6.	Set Take Profit levels (Note #3)  

Note #1 ( Double top ):  
The first step for the formation of 2618 is to form a  double top  at key resistance levels. Why at key resistance levels? Because we want to avoid fake double tops which can occur occasionally.  

There are some variations between various resources (books, websites) regarding the definitions of “double top”. The main differences occur where:  
a)	Some said for a  double top  to be valid, the wick of the 2nd top cannot exceed the wick of the 1st top; whereas, others said:  
b)	The wick of the 2nd top can exceed the wick of the 1st top but the candle close of the 2nd top CANNOT exceed the wick of the 1st top; or  
c)	The wick of the 2nd top can exceed the wick of the 1st top and the candle close of the 2nd top CAN exceed the wick of the 1st top; or  
d)	The wick of the 2nd top meets at least the candle close of the 1st top; or  
e)	The body of the 2nd top cannot exceed the body of the 1st top  

Personally, I would say all the above definitions work just fine although I do prefer definition a) because it means that the selling pressure is strong and the bulls fail to make a higher high. When there is a higher high formed in a downtrend, it can mean the downtrend has reversed and therefore you might not want to sell when the price pulls back to the 0.618 fib retracement.  

Note #2 ( 0.618 retracement ):  
When the price pulls back to 0.618, it does not mean to sell straight away. There must be more than one reason to sell other than the 0.618 retrace. The more reasons the better. In this example, you can see there are certainly structures (key resistance levels) at the 0.618 retrace. As well, there was a  double top  formed on the lower time frame. Consequently, you can sell.  

After  BTC -1.03%  hit the 0.618 retrace the first time, the price dropped from $9735 to $8650. but quickly bounced back to the 0.618 retrace level. That was a second & better opportunity to sell. Not only did  BTC -1.03%  form a  double top  on the larger time frame, but also with a  bearish  divergence on the 4hr time frame. Accordingly, you have more reasons to sell.  

Note #3 (Set take profit)  
Same as the rules of “Double top”, there are some variations as to which price level should you take profits. Personally, I would stick to the below:  
1)	First, take profit when risk/reward ratio hits 1:1 (recommend to take 30% - 50% profits and adjust the SL of the remaining positions to break-even)

 BTC -1.03%  is on the verge of breaking to a daily higher high on the bounce if the bulls can see a push this morning. 
If we reject from here the daily will form a lower high and we will see a tightening pattern within the highlighted  support and resistance  lines.  
Important for the bulls to show up or we could stay in this range into tomorrow.  
Healthy consolidation after the most recent bull move and the 15 min chart needs to change the trend.  
Also look to  EMA  12 support on the 4 hour and hourly.  
Another morning like yesterday with the bulls comfortable as worst case, we likely stay in the tightening pattern if bulls cannot prove themselves.

The current situation of  Bitcoin -1.03%  is quite difficult. We are on a clear treshold. A lot of traders are saying that we are on a clear downtrend, but the same amount of people are claiming that we will have our reversal soon. 

This article tries to sum up all important information you have to need! 

1: Retracement of a parabolic uptrend: 
There is a rule of thumb for the retracement of a parabolic uptrend. We should retrace to approx. the 0.786  Fibonacci Retracement  +/- 10%! 
Depending where we start the count, we are already in that target. Although both ways (blue and red) have still some space for a further downwave! 







2: The bloody support of Bitcoin: 
The average cost of mining one  bitcoin -1.03%  are at USA/Russia approx. 4700$ and at 3100$ for china! 
A drop below a target of 4700$ would be savage. Nevertheless, i can't image that we will hit that target. 







3: Manipulation of  Bitcoin -1.03%  and the Bart Simpson Pattern: 
A friend of mine found some unusual patterns in the orderbooks of several exchanges: 
https://twitter.com/CryptoSyndrome 
Altcoins are manipulated on a daily basis. It seems that  bitcoin -1.03%  is now affected to this too, which causes all these 3-5% pump and dumps. 
Thus, we are forming all the time the Bartin Simpsons Patterns. 

4: Similarity to 2014: 
Bitcoin -1.03%  now: 






Bitcoin -1.03%  2014: 







5: Deminishing downtrend and a strong support 
If we see the falling  wedges  as the force of the downtrend, then the force is diminishing! 
Furthermore we have strong support which is holding now for the 4th time! 







6: The Indicators 
Having a look at the indicators at 2D, we have a good potential for an upwave now. 
The  volume  is deminishing which should indicate a breakout soon. 
The  MACD  is about to cross, the  RSI  was slightly overbought and is heading up like the  Stoch .  RSI . 
The 200  EMA  is slighty under the current price and act as a support. 

7: The symetrical Triangle 
The theory says, that we should have in a  sym -0.80% . triangle 5 times an  ABC  wave. The waves are not perfect, but we can construct them. 






As you can see, the last four ABC-Waves formed always a 1:1 extention, which indicates that we have finished wave 5. 

8: A possible Head and Shoulders 
Even if this is not the most perfect  Head and Shoulders  Pattern, it's still valid! 
We are currently at the neckline, which is a strong and important resistance. Breaking upwards should indicate a good uptrend. 







9: The magic  6th 0.00%  of the month 






Suprisingly we have on every  6th 0.00%  of the month a reversal. Why is that??? 
One reason could be the  CME Group Futures  with dates for the settlements always nearby the  6th 0.00%  of the month! 
http://www.cmegroup.com 

10: Longterm  Bullish  TA 
The whole pattern could be seen as a big  bullish pennant . 







11: Shortterm  Bullish  TA 
Leading diagonal  starting wave1 of an  Elliott Wave , since we have now an impulse wave, after the 5x  ABC  pattern inside the triangle is finished. 
Our target should be at the top of the triangle nearby 8600-8800$. 







12: Longterm  Bearish  TA 
We also can argue, that we are currenty in an downtrend and the  sym -0.80% . triangle just continuing the trend. 
Our target should be nearby 6000$ which is also a finished downwards  Elliott Wave .

Nothing is happening in the market:  volatility  has become extinct and coins' trading fallen out of fashion. Range-bound bots and robotic humans absolutely prosper in this environment. The price was unable to break the 7700 threshold. For me this is a  bearish  signal. Indicators provide mixed signals, so let's examine wave structure. The move from May 29 is a  3-wave -0.12%  correction within a larger downtrend. A price drop below 7500 would confirm this scenario.

					Impulse Wave Truncation (Truncated Fifth) - 
Truncated 5th wave is when the market has become so over-extended in Wave 3 that there is not much force left for the impulse wave to come to a proper completion. So when this happens, there is a chance that the last wave of the impulse, Wave 5, will not reach the end of Wave 3 before the market starts correcting in the opposite direction. At this point, the market is just too exhausted. This condition is often called a “failure” or a “Truncation.”

I can see many people still believe that we are going inside a  descending triangle . I also believed this in my idea that i shard on may 1st: 



 

Things can change so quickly and if we didn't adapt to the changes then someone will. That's why i believe that we have to be in fast adapt mode in this market. Doesn't mean that you need to change without checking yourself. I try to find 2-3 confirmations before i change my idea on something. This includes pattern changes, trend changes etc 

There are 21 corrective wave patterns in EW which is categorized into major 3 corrective wave patterns: 

Zigzag  (5-3-5) 
Flat (3-3-5) 
Triangle (3-3-3-3-3) 

And other patterns are combinations of the above which is:  

Double three (A combination of two corrective patterns above) 
Triple three (A combination of three corrective patterns above) 

So what i can see now is that we are in two double three combination corrective wave pattern: 








More info here:  

https://elliottwave-forecast.com/elliott-wave-theory/#corrective-waves 

Confirmations: 

1. Wave ((i)) of C is 1.6k and ((v)) is going to be completed below the triangle 
2. Wave (E) of the triangle can't go beyond the triangle.  
3. This has happened twice before in 2013 & 2015 

Each wave  got 3 subwaves (a,b &c) inside and we are in the subwave c of ((y)) of Y which is an impulsive wave. 

Impulsive waves: 1,3,5,a,c 
Corrective waves: 2,4,b 

Normal Fibo Ratios for these waves are: 

wave 2 = 0.5 - 0.8 of wave 1  
wave 3 = 1.236 - 1.618 of wave 1  
wave 4 = 0.5 - 0.618 of wave 3  
wave 5 = 0.618 - 1 of wave 1  
wave B = 0.5 - 0.8 of wave A  
wave C = 0.618 - 1.236 of wave A  

Now if you check what happened in subwave a of ((y)) of Y you can see that: 

Wave (i) of a: 985$ 
Wave (ii) of a: 434$  
Wave ( iii -0.62% ) of a: 1207$  
Wave (iv) of a: 691$ [~0.618 of Wave ( iii -0.62% )] 
Wave (v) of a: 950$  








I have seen  BTC -1.03%  impulsive waves fibo ratios almost the same as the previous impulsive wave fibo ratios. 
Now if you apply the same for the last wave C of (E) this is what you get: 

Wave ((i)) of c: 1587$ 
Wave ((ii)) of c  = 793$ 
Wave (( iii -0.62% )) of c  = 1961$ 
Wave ((iv)) of c [~0.618 of Wave (( iii -0.62% ))] = 1212$ 
Wave ((v)) of c  = 1587$ 








Also note that Wave ((iv)) might not retrace upto 0.618 of Wave (( iii -0.62% )) as everyone will be in panic mode by that time so minimum retracement would be around 0.386 of Wave (( iii -0.62% )) which is around 756$ and this is why i can see it goes down to 5k level or little bit more towards 4.7k which is the lowest level of the  support zone  (orange dotted lines) 








So 3 Possible Support lines for reversal would be 

1. Blue: 5800 - 6100 (Only possible if Wave ((v)) is truncated) 
2. Orange: 4700 - 5000 (This is most likely where we heading)  
3. Red: 4100 - 4400 (Only possible if Wave (( iii -0.62% )) is extended)

 Bitcoin -1.03%  has recently developed an interesting pattern of completing a  bullish  and  bearish  cycle on the sixth of every month in an alternating order. As we can see in the chart above, a fall is followed by a rise. This has happened twice before and is expected to happen again now on the  6th 0.00%  of June, 2018. This time  Bitcoin -1.03%  will finish a  bearish  cycle and I expected to begin the next  bullish  cycle at least till the end of  6th 0.00%  of July, 2018. 

This pattern of rise and fall is also supported by other patterns on the chart that signal a  bullish  reversal. The support line has also held firmly and if this pattern of alternating rise and fall ensues,  Bitcoin -1.03%  could very well make new highs by the end of the year. The  RSI  is recovering from oversold levels and has now approached a normal.  Bitcoin -1.03%  is currently at a favorable point for  bullish  entries. The price broke a long term resistance as it break past the downtrend line in April, 2018. This was a big accomplishment for the bulls but the lack of confidence pulled the price back to the support line. Currently, the price is just above the support line and appears to be all set for a  bullish  comeback but the reality is, there are not enough bulls in the market. 

The past few months have been devastating for the price of  Bitcoin -1.03%  ( BTC -1.03% ) and a lot of investors are still running scared. Institutional investors are looking for more clarity regarding regulations concerning cryptocurrencies and also safer ways to invest and store their coins. As for retail investors, most of them comprise of first time investors who have never traded any financial asset before. So, when they saw that  Bitcoin -1.03%  ( BTC -1.03% ) is making 20% gains every day, they thought this could go on forever and jumped with both feet, only to find the carpet pulled under from their feet. Big investors have always played small investors as cannon fodder and have gotten away with their schemes even in regulated markets like forex or the stock market. Cryptocurrencies is a new market with no proper regulations which means it is natural to expect that those who can afford to not play by the rules, most likely won’t.

Hello friends,  

It's been a while since my last post; lack of time and an urge to do more research has mainly driven me to take a break from posting ideas on TradingView. I am still in the process of doing more research and study, but I figure posting once in a while couldn't hurt. 

Since I have become recently very convinced about this, I am outlining a very possible situation with  Bitcoin -1.03%  where the  trend line  we have been on since early October breaks, reaching around a temporary low of $5000. This is examined on the  daily chart , since this is one of the best charts to examine trends of this size. I have to first and foremost say that I am not trying to spread fear, I know many people do not like to hear  bearish  ideas, but  technical analysis  is ultimately a rational exercise, and I feel that possibilities with very strong signs should be explored. 

There are a few things to look at, but I first want to talk about the big picture with, long-term  support and resistance  lines. I think most people can agree that there was a very significant downtrending resistance line that began from the peak of the  ATH 0.63%  in late December, to the low of around $6400 (thick red line). After the break from that line, it seems we moved into a sideways trend, bouncing back and forth between an emerging downtrending resistance line (light red) and a support line that we seem to have been respecting since mid-October (light green); at least this appears to be the case with the lows, where the angle's effectiveness appears very strongly. Finally, based on previous bounces, we can establish a support of around $5000-$5300 (I've thus created a small  support zone  around that range, in dark green), as well as lower supports around $3200 and $2000 (though I do not believe these will be reached, in dark green).   

Now, onto the analysis - it's no secret that  Bitcoin -1.03%  has been squeezing in, ready for a significant move either upwards or downwards. Initially I considered the upwards move to be more likely due to the significant media attention cryptocurrency has been receiving, but after viewing previous market cycles of  Bitcoin -1.03%  (check 2013), it seems clear to me that the  bearish  scenario of closing in on the market cycle is very likely, and should at the very least be prepared for with proper risk management. According to Dow Theory, which is said to have laid the foundations of modern  technical analysis , history repeats itself, and this is a situation where we forced to consider this. 

Should we break from the line, we will likely fall straight down to the $5000-$5000 area, where we will shoot back up and bounce towards around $6700 or so (maybe a little less). From there one, we will likely enter a sideways trend, which we will continue until we see higher highs and higher lows and parabolic movement returns, which could lead to us challenging the all-time high, and hitting $35k-$50k. 

NOTE: I seem to have reached the max character limit for this section of the idea, so I will continue my text below.

Comment:
					Onto the short-term: 


Scenario A: 

The reason why I have drawn this movement into a pennant is this way, is simply because we have been moving through this ascending triangle for quite a while now (May 23rd to today). I don't think that the pattern will be sufficient to directly lead into a strong sell-off, but we should consider that the size of ascending triangle suggests a small movement downwards at the very least, which can create a higher low, and thus move into position into a bearish pennant. Why would a bearish pennant occur here and not have a bounce to $8500-$8700? The reason is in positioning - the huge downtrend (May 5th to May 26th) creates a very nice flagpole in which it hits around the $5000 area very perfectly, and thus I would not be surprised if this happens. 

Second reason: on the Stoch RSI indicator on the daily chart, it appears to be dangerously high, which would suggest it being oversold. For the most part, it seems to have called lows and highs, at least to some extent. This overdrawn movement may very well have increased the likelyhood of Bitcoin being oversold. This could suggest that this is the last step into a sharp downturn, but this does not preclude Situation B. Volume has also been steadily decreasing, but this is the case with any sort of consolidation, I believe. 

Finally, the lines I have drawn below the triangle are simply bounces that I think seem fairly reasonable. The length from to support to the lines correlate with the length of the flagpole, of course, though it may seem chopped off due to the huge line from the long-term support downwards. 


Scenario B: 

This is much simpler, Bitcoin hits the upper resistance line, bounces off, challenges the lower support line, and we potentially see a break, and the rest unfolds from there. 


----------------------------------------------------------------------- 


With all this being said, do not fear if you are hoping for more parabolic movement - this likely will not be the end, and will simply be the set up for a long, drawn out sideways movement until the first signs of bullish activity begin and we start all over again. If you are longing around here, please consider using risk management, prepare for every possibility. If you are shorting, the same applies. 

Please trade with care. I wish the best to all traders!

Comment:
					This really is a very minor note, but I just want to emphasize that the rising wedge (which I erroneously refer to as an ascending triangle, a bad habit I have) entering a bearish pennant is more based on intuition than anything. Also, this pennant is mainly based on the conservative assumption that the break will happen at 7900, if it happens at 7700 where we seem to be general resistance, the pennant would look something like this:

Jun 7




I am Mid term-bullish on  BTC -1.03%  going into the end of this week, but looking to get into the market on a pull back to occur before I get in to the market.  The jury is still out as to whether this weekly bear trend is ready to turn around.  

We can see that both the  RSI  and  MFI  are both  Bullish  on the daily having bottomed when reaching oversold on both at c. $7k support where we found our longer term  trend line . 

We are currently in the process of meeting the Tenkan (blue line) as I write this, so in the very short term, I am looking for a pull back to $7550 range for an entry.  One of the main reasons for this is that on the 4hour timeframes we are close to completing an edge to edge trade so the risk reward doesn’t fit my profile, however a break out from the cloud or above the Tenkan around $7777 will make me enter the market. 

The  RSI  and  MFI  have both been excellent indicators in this bear market.  Whenever  RSI  has gone above the 60 and the  MFI  80; its time to exit the market from a  bullish  trade and consider shorting as it progresses higher.   

Based on the  RSI ,  MFI  trends and the fact that we will run into the Kijun at just around $8-8.2k, I will be scalling out at this  bearish  confluence level to start looking for pull backs and reassessment as i believe it to be a key point as  

Best case scenario this trade would yield a 10% return before leverage. 
This is for illustrative purposes only, please DYOR and goodluck with your trading.

So the pullback trade that we were looking at worked out & has made it's way back to the neckline level of structure. We are now at what i like to call a ""decision point"" Essentially IF price is able to violate this current level od structure THEN we're likely to continue to our next price projection.  

Something that a lot of newer traders don't understand is that when it comes to bigger moves, the market will often provide multiple opportunities to get involved. For those who don't rush and for those who don't get discouraged. If you perform consistent analysis you can often find multiple ways to involve yourself in a trade even if you missed the first strike.

My best idea ever, taking some time off the last 2 days :) The whales just continue to play their little games by squeezing leveraged short and long positions out of the market. Can't play them, it's just too easy. Maybe it's time we retail traders stand together, combine our  volume  and use their own game against them. Yeah, maybe we could even make a blockbuster movie about this :) I love me some science fiction :) LOL  

My last update of the previous analysis i showed 2 important support levels where the price could bounce up from. The first support around 7350 did the trick and the price got pushed back to 7700. From that point on i told my members that i thought i was seeing distribution, but it was still very confusing to figure out what was going on. TA was showing  bullish  signs, that  bull flag  was very strong and was even turning slowly up and was about to squeeze upwards. But of course out of no where the price got dumped, the move we saw a few hours ago. After that 200 point drop the price got pushed up again to 7700 like that dump was a glitch. If your a whale, why not push out leveraged traders and take your money while your accumulating or distributing. It's like a bonus, like the cherry on top :)  

Anyway, in this chart we can see allot of similarities of what is going on. As you know i have been saying i am still  bearish  for the medium term, but i just could not say what was going to happen on the short term. 2 days ago after we finally dropped out of that  wedge , i said we would have 2 options.  
- Break those 2 support levels from the last update of my previous chart (73xx and 71xx) 
- Make a higher low at those same support levels and make another move up above the high.  
 
As we can see in the chart, the  fractal  is not 100% identical so it's no guarantee that the 7700 high we just saw is the high already and that we start to move down. But based on this  fractal , i don't want to see the price get above the 7800/7900. This  fractal  confirms my  bearish  view as well. That's why TA is so great, you can turn any chart to fit your view :). 

Even without this  fractal , i just give it a very small chance that 7K price action is the fundament of a low to start another bull rally, i just highly doubt that. I want to see more  volume  to begin with and at least  double bottom  kind of formation. So the minimum i expect is a test of the 7100/6900in the coming week or 2. But the movement i have in mind for the med term is a drop below the 7K to form a big V shape low. If we get to see that, than i might even become  bullish  for the rest of the year :).  

As long as the price stays above the 73xx, we have to assume the bulls are still in control and we should see another wave up. So for me the 73xx is an important turning point.

Comment:
					At the moment it looks like bulls are trying to push higher, this bull flag/triangle is still very strong. So no sign of weakness yet! First small sign would be a drop below 7620/7600. Bulls need to break 7700

Comment:
					This is my bigger picture, think this bearish triangle is still 100% in play. I think if bulls can't break the 7800/7900 the bearish version is probably going to happen. Can't say HOW it will go, this blue line is just a guess. But a big V shape low would be the most bullish for the long term. I still think we are seeing distribution here. The only way this idea can be countered, is through a big increase of buying volume, if that doesn't happen, i think it's only a matter of time.

Comment:
					Lower time frame we can see a new upwards channel and maybe even a rising wedge. From the looks of it, it's slowly going down to test the support line again. Depending on what will happen there we can make a better prediction for the rest of the day.

					What a surprise, nothing has changed :) 

The price took a small dump but the volume was low so no real read on what the intent was. So we might see another move up, if we start to see a small pump that takes out the 7800, be aware of a fake breakout. The blue line is a possibility of what the move could look like IF we move up and if the breakout fails. If that happens than we will probably get confirmation if the price breaks the 7600ish. If we break the 7800 it should stay above the 7700 to confirm another move up. Not much more to say about what's going on.

217,1528359434.0,Taiwan_Bear,2618 (Double top & 0.618 pull-back) - do not miss it!!,"
In the last couple of TAs I have mentioned the “2618 pattern” and have been asked what 2618 means. Sorry for taking it so long as it took me quite a while to put everything altogether. But, as promised, I have explained below the rules and trade setups for the 2618 pattern.  

What are the rules/setups/steps for 2618?  
1.	Form a  double top  (Note #1)  
2.	Neckline has to be broken  
3.	After price found support at point (b), wait for pull back to 0.618 fib retracement of (a)(b)  
4.	After price retraced to 0.618, look for confluence and sell (eg. Structures,  trendlines  ,  double top  on a lower time frame,  rsi  divergence,  bearish pin bar  ,  inside bar  break down etc.) (Note #2)  
5.	Stop loss to be set above  double top 
6.	Set Take Profit levels (Note #3)  

Note #1 ( Double top ):  
The first step for the formation of 2618 is to form a  double top  at key resistance levels. Why at key resistance levels? Because we want to avoid fake double tops which can occur occasionally.  

There are some variations between various resources (books, websites) regarding the definitions of “double top”. The main differences occur where:  
a)	Some said for a  double top  to be valid, the wick of the 2nd top cannot exceed the wick of the 1st top; whereas, others said:  
b)	The wick of the 2nd top can exceed the wick of the 1st top but the candle close of the 2nd top CANNOT exceed the wick of the 1st top; or  
c)	The wick of the 2nd top can exceed the wick of the 1st top and the candle close of the 2nd top CAN exceed the wick of the 1st top; or  
d)	The wick of the 2nd top meets at least the candle close of the 1st top; or  
e)	The body of the 2nd top cannot exceed the body of the 1st top  

Personally, I would say all the above definitions work just fine although I do prefer definition a) because it means that the selling pressure is strong and the bulls fail to make a higher high. When there is a higher high formed in a downtrend, it can mean the downtrend has reversed and therefore you might not want to sell when the price pulls back to the 0.618 fib retracement.  

Note #2 ( 0.618 retracement ):  
When the price pulls back to 0.618, it does not mean to sell straight away. There must be more than one reason to sell other than the 0.618 retrace. The more reasons the better. In this example, you can see there are certainly structures (key resistance levels) at the 0.618 retrace. As well, there was a  double top  formed on the lower time frame. Consequently, you can sell.  

After  BTC -1.03%  hit the 0.618 retrace the first time, the price dropped from $9735 to $8650. but quickly bounced back to the 0.618 retrace level. That was a second & better opportunity to sell. Not only did  BTC -1.03%  form a  double top  on the larger time frame, but also with a  bearish  divergence on the 4hr time frame. Accordingly, you have more reasons to sell.  

Note #3 (Set take profit)  
Same as the rules of “Double top”, there are some variations as to which price level should you take profits. Personally, I would stick to the below:  
1)	First, take profit when risk/reward ratio hits 1:1 (recommend to take 30% - 50% profits and adjust the SL of the remaining positions to break-even)  
2)	When price hits the same price level as the low after the neckline is broken ((b) point in this example)  
3)	When price hits 1.272 fib extension of (a)(b)  
4)	When price hits point (d) (using  AB=CD  pattern. If you are not sure what the rules of  AB=CD  are, you can refer to my previous TA in which I have attached the link below)  
5)	If in a one-way market (heavily bearish/bullish), you can always keep 10% to 20% of your positions and take profits when risk/reward ratio hits 1:5 or even 1:10

 BTC -1.03%  is on the verge of breaking to a daily higher high on the bounce if the bulls can see a push this morning. 
If we reject from here the daily will form a lower high and we will see a tightening pattern within the highlighted  support and resistance  lines.  
Important for the bulls to show up or we could stay in this range into tomorrow.  
Healthy consolidation after the most recent bull move and the 15 min chart needs to change the trend.  
Also look to  EMA  12 support on the 4 hour and hourly.  
Another morning like yesterday with the bulls comfortable as worst case, we likely stay in the tightening pattern if bulls cannot prove themselves.

The current situation of  Bitcoin -1.03%  is quite difficult. We are on a clear treshold. A lot of traders are saying that we are on a clear downtrend, but the same amount of people are claiming that we will have our reversal soon. 

This article tries to sum up all important information you have to need! 

1: Retracement of a parabolic uptrend: 
There is a rule of thumb for the retracement of a parabolic uptrend. We should retrace to approx. the 0.786  Fibonacci Retracement  +/- 10%! 
Depending where we start the count, we are already in that target. Although both ways (blue and red) have still some space for a further downwave! 







2: The bloody support of Bitcoin: 
The average cost of mining one  bitcoin -1.03%  are at USA/Russia approx. 4700$ and at 3100$ for china! 
A drop below a target of 4700$ would be savage. Nevertheless, i can't image that we will hit that target. 







3: Manipulation of  Bitcoin -1.03%  and the Bart Simpson Pattern: 
A friend of mine found some unusual patterns in the orderbooks of several exchanges: 
https://twitter.com/CryptoSyndrome 
Altcoins are manipulated on a daily basis. It seems that  bitcoin -1.03%  is now affected to this too, which causes all these 3-5% pump and dumps. 
Thus, we are forming all the time the Bartin Simpsons Patterns. 

4: Similarity to 2014: 
Bitcoin -1.03%  now: 






Bitcoin -1.03%  2014: 







5: Deminishing downtrend and a strong support 
If we see the falling  wedges  as the force of the downtrend, then the force is diminishing! 
Furthermore we have strong support which is holding now for the 4th time! 







6: The Indicators 
Having a look at the indicators at 2D, we have a good potential for an upwave now. 
The  volume  is deminishing which should indicate a breakout soon. 
The  MACD  is about to cross, the  RSI  was slightly overbought and is heading up like the  Stoch .  RSI . 
The 200  EMA  is slighty under the current price and act as a support. 

7: The symetrical Triangle 
The theory says, that we should have in a  sym -0.80% . triangle 5 times an  ABC  wave. The waves are not perfect, but we can construct them. 






As you can see, the last four ABC-Waves formed always a 1:1 extention, which indicates that we have finished wave 5. 

8: A possible Head and Shoulders 
Even if this is not the most perfect  Head and Shoulders  Pattern, it's still valid! 
We are currently at the neckline, which is a strong and important resistance. Breaking upwards should indicate a good uptrend. 







9: The magic  6th 0.00%  of the month 






Suprisingly we have on every  6th 0.00%  of the month a reversal. Why is that??? 
One reason could be the  CME Group Futures  with dates for the settlements always nearby the  6th 0.00%  of the month! 
http://www.cmegroup.com 

10: Longterm  Bullish  TA 
The whole pattern could be seen as a big  bullish pennant . 







11: Shortterm  Bullish  TA 
Leading diagonal  starting wave1 of an  Elliott Wave , since we have now an impulse wave, after the 5x  ABC  pattern inside the triangle is finished. 
Our target should be at the top of the triangle nearby 8600-8800$. 







12: Longterm  Bearish  TA 
We also can argue, that we are currenty in an downtrend and the  sym -0.80% . triangle just continuing the trend. 
Our target should be nearby 6000$ which is also a finished downwards  Elliott Wave .

Nothing is happening in the market:  volatility  has become extinct and coins' trading fallen out of fashion. Range-bound bots and robotic humans absolutely prosper in this environment. The price was unable to break the 7700 threshold. For me this is a  bearish  signal. Indicators provide mixed signals, so let's examine wave structure. The move from May 29 is a  3-wave -0.12%  correction within a larger downtrend. A price drop below 7500 would confirm this scenario.

					Impulse Wave Truncation (Truncated Fifth) - 
Truncated 5th wave is when the market has become so over-extended in Wave 3 that there is not much force left for the impulse wave to come to a proper completion. So when this happens, there is a chance that the last wave of the impulse, Wave 5, will not reach the end of Wave 3 before the market starts correcting in the opposite direction. At this point, the market is just too exhausted. This condition is often called a “failure” or a “Truncation.”

I can see many people still believe that we are going inside a  descending triangle . I also believed this in my idea that i shard on may 1st: 



 

Things can change so quickly and if we didn't adapt to the changes then someone will. That's why i believe that we have to be in fast adapt mode in this market. Doesn't mean that you need to change without checking yourself. I try to find 2-3 confirmations before i change my idea on something. This includes pattern changes, trend changes etc 

There are 21 corrective wave patterns in EW which is categorized into major 3 corrective wave patterns: 

Zigzag  (5-3-5) 
Flat (3-3-5) 
Triangle (3-3-3-3-3) 

And other patterns are combinations of the above which is:  

Double three (A combination of two corrective patterns above) 
Triple three (A combination of three corrective patterns above) 

So what i can see now is that we are in two double three combination corrective wave pattern: 








More info here:  

https://elliottwave-forecast.com/elliott-wave-theory/#corrective-waves 

Confirmations: 

1. Wave ((i)) of C is 1.6k and ((v)) is going to be completed below the triangle 
2. Wave (E) of the triangle can't go beyond the triangle.  
3. This has happened twice before in 2013 & 2015 

Each wave  got 3 subwaves (a,b &c) inside and we are in the subwave c of ((y)) of Y which is an impulsive wave. 

Impulsive waves: 1,3,5,a,c 
Corrective waves: 2,4,b 

Normal Fibo Ratios for these waves are: 

wave 2 = 0.5 - 0.8 of wave 1  
wave 3 = 1.236 - 1.618 of wave 1  
wave 4 = 0.5 - 0.618 of wave 3  
wave 5 = 0.618 - 1 of wave 1  
wave B = 0.5 - 0.8 of wave A  
wave C = 0.618 - 1.236 of wave A  

Now if you check what happened in subwave a of ((y)) of Y you can see that: 

Wave (i) of a: 985$ 
Wave (ii) of a: 434$  
Wave ( iii 0.01% ) of a: 1207$  
Wave (iv) of a: 691$ [~0.618 of Wave ( iii 0.01% )] 
Wave (v) of a: 950$  








I have seen  BTC -1.03%  impulsive waves fibo ratios almost the same as the previous impulsive wave fibo ratios. 
Now if you apply the same for the last wave C of (E) this is what you get: 

Wave ((i)) of c: 1587$ 
Wave ((ii)) of c  = 793$ 
Wave (( iii 0.01% )) of c  = 1961$ 
Wave ((iv)) of c [~0.618 of Wave (( iii 0.01% ))] = 1212$ 
Wave ((v)) of c  = 1587$ 








Also note that Wave ((iv)) might not retrace upto 0.618 of Wave (( iii 0.01% )) as everyone will be in panic mode by that time so minimum retracement would be around 0.386 of Wave (( iii 0.01% )) which is around 756$ and this is why i can see it goes down to 5k level or little bit more towards 4.7k which is the lowest level of the  support zone  (orange dotted lines) 








So 3 Possible Support lines for reversal would be 

1. Blue: 5800 - 6100 (Only possible if Wave ((v)) is truncated) 
2. Orange: 4700 - 5000 (This is most likely where we heading)  
3. Red: 4100 - 4400 (Only possible if Wave (( iii 0.01% )) is extended)

 Bitcoin -1.03%  has recently developed an interesting pattern of completing a  bullish  and  bearish  cycle on the sixth of every month in an alternating order. As we can see in the chart above, a fall is followed by a rise. This has happened twice before and is expected to happen again now on the  6th 0.00%  of June, 2018. This time  Bitcoin -1.03%  will finish a  bearish  cycle and I expected to begin the next  bullish  cycle at least till the end of  6th 0.00%  of July, 2018. 

This pattern of rise and fall is also supported by other patterns on the chart that signal a  bullish  reversal. The support line has also held firmly and if this pattern of alternating rise and fall ensues,  Bitcoin -1.03%  could very well make new highs by the end of the year. The  RSI  is recovering from oversold levels and has now approached a normal.  Bitcoin -1.03%  is currently at a favorable point for  bullish  entries. The price broke a long term resistance as it break past the downtrend line in April, 2018. This was a big accomplishment for the bulls but the lack of confidence pulled the price back to the support line. Currently, the price is just above the support line and appears to be all set for a  bullish  comeback but the reality is, there are not enough bulls in the market. 

The past few months have been devastating for the price of  Bitcoin -1.03%  ( BTC -1.03% ) and a lot of investors are still running scared. Institutional investors are looking for more clarity regarding regulations concerning cryptocurrencies and also safer ways to invest and store their coins. As for retail investors, most of them comprise of first time investors who have never traded any financial asset before. So, when they saw that  Bitcoin -1.03%  ( BTC -1.03% ) is making 20% gains every day, they thought this could go on forever and jumped with both feet, only to find the carpet pulled under from their feet. Big investors have always played small investors as cannon fodder and have gotten away with their schemes even in regulated markets like forex or the stock market. Cryptocurrencies is a new market with no proper regulations which means it is natural to expect that those who can afford to not play by the rules, most likely won’t.

Hello friends,  

It's been a while since my last post; lack of time and an urge to do more research has mainly driven me to take a break from posting ideas on TradingView. I am still in the process of doing more research and study, but I figure posting once in a while couldn't hurt. 

Since I have become recently very convinced about this, I am outlining a very possible situation with  Bitcoin -1.03%  where the  trend line  we have been on since early October breaks, reaching around a temporary low of $5000. This is examined on the  daily chart , since this is one of the best charts to examine trends of this size. I have to first and foremost say that I am not trying to spread fear, I know many people do not like to hear  bearish  ideas, but  technical analysis  is ultimately a rational exercise, and I feel that possibilities with very strong signs should be explored. 

There are a few things to look at, but I first want to talk about the big picture with, long-term  support and resistance  lines. I think most people can agree that there was a very significant downtrending resistance line that began from the peak of the  ATH 0.63%  in late December, to the low of around $6400 (thick red line). After the break from that line, it seems we moved into a sideways trend, bouncing back and forth between an emerging downtrending resistance line (light red) and a support line that we seem to have been respecting since mid-October (light green); at least this appears to be the case with the lows, where the angle's effectiveness appears very strongly. Finally, based on previous bounces, we can establish a support of around $5000-$5300 (I've thus created a small  support zone  around that range, in dark green), as well as lower supports around $3200 and $2000 (though I do not believe these will be reached, in dark green).   

Now, onto the analysis - it's no secret that  Bitcoin -1.03%  has been squeezing in, ready for a significant move either upwards or downwards. Initially I considered the upwards move to be more likely due to the significant media attention cryptocurrency has been receiving, but after viewing previous market cycles of  Bitcoin -1.03%  (check 2013), it seems clear to me that the  bearish  scenario of closing in on the market cycle is very likely, and should at the very least be prepared for with proper risk management. According to Dow Theory, which is said to have laid the foundations of modern  technical analysis , history repeats itself, and this is a situation where we forced to consider this. 

Should we break from the line, we will likely fall straight down to the $5000-$5000 area, where we will shoot back up and bounce towards around $6700 or so (maybe a little less). From there one, we will likely enter a sideways trend, which we will continue until we see higher highs and higher lows and parabolic movement returns, which could lead to us challenging the all-time high, and hitting $35k-$50k. 

NOTE: I seem to have reached the max character limit for this section of the idea, so I will continue my text below.

					Onto the short-term: 


Scenario A: 

The reason why I have drawn this movement into a pennant is this way, is simply because we have been moving through this ascending triangle for quite a while now (May 23rd to today). I don't think that the pattern will be sufficient to directly lead into a strong sell-off, but we should consider that the size of ascending triangle suggests a small movement downwards at the very least, which can create a higher low, and thus move into position into a bearish pennant. Why would a bearish pennant occur here and not have a bounce to $8500-$8700? The reason is in positioning - the huge downtrend (May 5th to May 26th) creates a very nice flagpole in which it hits around the $5000 area very perfectly, and thus I would not be surprised if this happens. 

Second reason: on the Stoch RSI indicator on the daily chart, it appears to be dangerously high, which would suggest it being oversold. For the most part, it seems to have called lows and highs, at least to some extent. This overdrawn movement may very well have increased the likelyhood of Bitcoin being oversold. This could suggest that this is the last step into a sharp downturn, but this does not preclude Situation B. Volume has also been steadily decreasing, but this is the case with any sort of consolidation, I believe. 

Finally, the lines I have drawn below the triangle are simply bounces that I think seem fairly reasonable. The length from to support to the lines correlate with the length of the flagpole, of course, though it may seem chopped off due to the huge line from the long-term support downwards. 


Scenario B: 

This is much simpler, Bitcoin hits the upper resistance line, bounces off, challenges the lower support line, and we potentially see a break, and the rest unfolds from there. 


----------------------------------------------------------------------- 


With all this being said, do not fear if you are hoping for more parabolic movement - this likely will not be the end, and will simply be the set up for a long, drawn out sideways movement until the first signs of bullish activity begin and we start all over again. If you are longing around here, please consider using risk management, prepare for every possibility. If you are shorting, the same applies. 

Please trade with care. I wish the best to all traders!

Comment:
					This really is a very minor note, but I just want to emphasize that the rising wedge (which I erroneously refer to as an ascending triangle, a bad habit I have) entering a bearish pennant is more based on intuition than anything. Also, this pennant is mainly based on the conservative assumption that the break will happen at 7900, if it happens at 7700 where we seem to be general resistance, the pennant would look something like this:

I am Mid term-bullish on  BTC -1.03%  going into the end of this week, but looking to get into the market on a pull back to occur before I get in to the market.  The jury is still out as to whether this weekly bear trend is ready to turn around.  

We can see that both the  RSI  and  MFI  are both  Bullish  on the daily having bottomed when reaching oversold on both at c. $7k support where we found our longer term  trend line . 

We are currently in the process of meeting the Tenkan (blue line) as I write this, so in the very short term, I am looking for a pull back to $7550 range for an entry.  One of the main reasons for this is that on the 4hour timeframes we are close to completing an edge to edge trade so the risk reward doesn’t fit my profile, however a break out from the cloud or above the Tenkan around $7777 will make me enter the market. 

The  RSI  and  MFI  have both been excellent indicators in this bear market.  Whenever  RSI  has gone above the 60 and the  MFI  80; its time to exit the market from a  bullish  trade and consider shorting as it progresses higher.   

Based on the  RSI ,  MFI  trends and the fact that we will run into the Kijun at just around $8-8.2k, I will be scalling out at this  bearish  confluence level to start looking for pull backs and reassessment as i believe it to be a key point as  

Best case scenario this trade would yield a 10% return before leverage. 
This is for illustrative purposes only, please DYOR and goodluck with your trading.

So the pullback trade that we were looking at worked out & has made it's way back to the neckline level of structure. We are now at what i like to call a ""decision point"" Essentially IF price is able to violate this current level od structure THEN we're likely to continue to our next price projection.  

Something that a lot of newer traders don't understand is that when it comes to bigger moves, the market will often provide multiple opportunities to get involved. For those who don't rush and for those who don't get discouraged. If you perform consistent analysis you can often find multiple ways to involve yourself in a trade even if you missed the first strike.

This is the way markets move, If you question my charting check my previous posts. Its as simple as pie. We are going down, How long and how far is too soon to say. Here is a chart that we can understand the future price action and where to buy back. Before you guys start blasting my comment section with the time and how it may not be right thats correct. I am not calculating the time I'm just making a technical drawing of the directions that we will see in the next few months.  

Recent price action has clear signs of wash trading / market manipulation fud and lots of nonsense. Its hard to prove almost impossible so as a trader we just need to deal with it. Ideally the situation you are supposed to trade are critical break up and break down points to enter the trade. Dont enter or exit dumb trades and lose money. As an experienced trader you should be looking for shorts, I would not consider a long unless we are over $10-12k

I am never good with words so instead of writing paragraphs of clarification to justify my call for SHORT since my last posting, I have explained everything on my chart with the least words possible using Fibonacci. It does not matter how popular  Bitcoin -1.03%  has become, or how deep it has disrupted the financial sector, or how many institutional investors have come to invest in it -- the psychology behind a market cycle does not change. 

I don't really encourage anyone to short  Bitcoin -1.03% , but in all honesty, don't expect the bulls to fly anytime soon. Like I said before, this correction that we are having right now is the ""MOTHER OF ALL CORRECTIONS"" after a 4-year-long bull cycle since the 2013 correction... and we are just halfway through.

My best idea ever, taking some time off the last 2 days :) The whales just continue to play their little games by squeezing leveraged short and long positions out of the market. Can't play them, it's just too easy. Maybe it's time we retail traders stand together, combine our  volume  and use their own game against them. Yeah, maybe we could even make a blockbuster movie about this :) I love me some science fiction :) LOL  

My last update of the previous analysis i showed 2 important support levels where the price could bounce up from. The first support around 7350 did the trick and the price got pushed back to 7700. From that point on i told my members that i thought i was seeing distribution, but it was still very confusing to figure out what was going on. TA was showing  bullish  signs, that  bull flag  was very strong and was even turning slowly up and was about to squeeze upwards. But of course out of no where the price got dumped, the move we saw a few hours ago. After that 200 point drop the price got pushed up again to 7700 like that dump was a glitch. If your a whale, why not push out leveraged traders and take your money while your accumulating or distributing. It's like a bonus, like the cherry on top :)  

Anyway, in this chart we can see allot of similarities of what is going on. As you know i have been saying i am still  bearish  for the medium term, but i just could not say what was going to happen on the short term. 2 days ago after we finally dropped out of that  wedge , i said we would have 2 options.  
- Break those 2 support levels from the last update of my previous chart (73xx and 71xx) 
- Make a higher low at those same support levels and make another move up above the high.  
 
As we can see in the chart, the  fractal  is not 100% identical so it's no guarantee that the 7700 high we just saw is the high already and that we start to move down. But based on this  fractal , i don't want to see the price get above the 7800/7900. This  fractal  confirms my  bearish  view as well. That's why TA is so great, you can turn any chart to fit your view :). 

Even without this  fractal , i just give it a very small chance that 7K price action is the fundament of a low to start another bull rally, i just highly doubt that. I want to see more  volume  to begin with and at least  double bottom  kind of formation. So the minimum i expect is a test of the 7100/6900in the coming week or 2. But the movement i have in mind for the med term is a drop below the 7K to form a big V shape low. If we get to see that, than i might even become  bullish  for the rest of the year :).  

As long as the price stays above the 73xx, we have to assume the bulls are still in control and we should see another wave up. So for me the 73xx is an important turning point.

Comment:
					At the moment it looks like bulls are trying to push higher, this bull flag/triangle is still very strong. So no sign of weakness yet! First small sign would be a drop below 7620/7600. Bulls need to break 7700

Comment:
					This is my bigger picture, think this bearish triangle is still 100% in play. I think if bulls can't break the 7800/7900 the bearish version is probably going to happen. Can't say HOW it will go, this blue line is just a guess. But a big V shape low would be the most bullish for the long term. I still think we are seeing distribution here. The only way this idea can be countered, is through a big increase of buying volume, if that doesn't happen, i think it's only a matter of time.

					Lower time frame we can see a new upwards channel and maybe even a rising wedge. From the looks of it, it's slowly going down to test the support line again. Depending on what will happen there we can make a better prediction for the rest of the day.

					What a surprise, nothing has changed :) 

The price took a small dump but the volume was low so no real read on what the intent was. So we might see another move up, if we start to see a small pump that takes out the 7800, be aware of a fake breakout. The blue line is a possibility of what the move could look like IF we move up and if the breakout fails. If that happens than we will probably get confirmation if the price breaks the 7600ish. If we break the 7800 it should stay above the 7700 to confirm another move up. Not much more to say about what's going on.

235,1528359434.0,Taiwan_Bear,2618 (Double top & 0.618 pull-back) - do not miss it!!,"
In the last couple of TAs I have mentioned the “2618 pattern” and have been asked what 2618 means. Sorry for taking it so long as it took me quite a while to put everything altogether. But, as promised, I have explained below the rules and trade setups for the 2618 pattern.  

What are the rules/setups/steps for 2618?  
1.	Form a  double top  (Note #1)  
2.	Neckline has to be broken  
3.	After price found support at point (b), wait for pull back to 0.618 fib retracement of (a)(b)  
4.	After price retraced to 0.618, look for confluence and sell (eg. Structures,  trendlines  ,  double top  on a lower time frame,  rsi  divergence,  bearish pin bar  ,  inside bar  break down etc.) (Note #2)  
5.	Stop loss to be set above  double top 
6.	Set Take Profit levels (Note #3)  

Note #1 ( Double top ):  
The first step for the formation of 2618 is to form a  double top  at key resistance levels. Why at key resistance levels? Because we want to avoid fake double tops which can occur occasionally.  

There are some variations between various resources (books, websites) regarding the definitions of “double top”. The main differences occur where:  
a)	Some said for a  double top  to be valid, the wick of the 2nd top cannot exceed the wick of the 1st top; whereas, others said:  
b)	The wick of the 2nd top can exceed the wick of the 1st top but the candle close of the 2nd top CANNOT exceed the wick of the 1st top; or  
c)	The wick of the 2nd top can exceed the wick of the 1st top and the candle close of the 2nd top CAN exceed the wick of the 1st top; or  
d)	The wick of the 2nd top meets at least the candle close of the 1st top; or  
e)	The body of the 2nd top cannot exceed the body of the 1st top  

Personally, I would say all the above definitions work just fine although I do prefer definition a) because it means that the selling pressure is strong and the bulls fail to make a higher high. When there is a higher high formed in a downtrend, it can mean the downtrend has reversed and therefore you might not want to sell when the price pulls back to the 0.618 fib retracement.  

Note #2 ( 0.618 retracement ):  
When the price pulls back to 0.618, it does not mean to sell straight away. There must be more than one reason to sell other than the 0.618 retrace. The more reasons the better. In this example, you can see there are certainly structures (key resistance levels) at the 0.618 retrace. As well, there was a  double top  formed on the lower time frame. Consequently, you can sell.  

After  BTC -1.03%  hit the 0.618 retrace the first time, the price dropped from $9735 to $8650. but quickly bounced back to the 0.618 retrace level. That was a second & better opportunity to sell. Not only did  BTC -1.03%  form a  double top  on the larger time frame, but also with a  bearish  divergence on the 4hr time frame. Accordingly, you have more reasons to sell.  

Note #3 (Set take profit)  
Same as the rules of “Double top”, there are some variations as to which price level should you take profits. Personally, I would stick to the below:  
1)	First, take profit when risk/reward ratio hits 1:1 (recommend to take 30% - 50% profits and adjust the SL of the remaining positions to break-even)  
2)	When price hits the same price level as the low after the neckline is broken ((b) point in this example)  
3)	When price hits 1.272 fib extension of (a)(b)  
4)	When price hits point (d) (using  AB=CD  pattern. If you are not sure what the rules of  AB=CD  are, you can refer to my previous TA in which I have attached the link below)  
5)	If in a one-way market (heavily bearish/bullish), you can always keep 10% to 20% of your positions and take profits when risk/reward ratio hits 1:5 or even 1:10

 BTC -1.03%  is on the verge of breaking to a daily higher high on the bounce if the bulls can see a push this morning. 
If we reject from here the daily will form a lower high and we will see a tightening pattern within the highlighted  support and resistance  lines.  
Important for the bulls to show up or we could stay in this range into tomorrow.  
Healthy consolidation after the most recent bull move and the 15 min chart needs to change the trend.  
Also look to  EMA  12 support on the 4 hour and hourly.  
Another morning like yesterday with the bulls comfortable as worst case, we likely stay in the tightening pattern if bulls cannot prove themselves.

The current situation of  Bitcoin -1.03%  is quite difficult. We are on a clear treshold. A lot of traders are saying that we are on a clear downtrend, but the same amount of people are claiming that we will have our reversal soon. 

This article tries to sum up all important information you have to need! 

1: Retracement of a parabolic uptrend: 
There is a rule of thumb for the retracement of a parabolic uptrend. We should retrace to approx. the 0.786  Fibonacci Retracement  +/- 10%! 
Depending where we start the count, we are already in that target. Although both ways (blue and red) have still some space for a further downwave! 







2: The bloody support of Bitcoin: 
The average cost of mining one  bitcoin -1.03%  are at USA/Russia approx. 4700$ and at 3100$ for china! 
A drop below a target of 4700$ would be savage. Nevertheless, i can't image that we will hit that target. 







3: Manipulation of  Bitcoin -1.03%  and the Bart Simpson Pattern: 
A friend of mine found some unusual patterns in the orderbooks of several exchanges: 
https://twitter.com/CryptoSyndrome 
Altcoins are manipulated on a daily basis. It seems that  bitcoin -1.03%  is now affected to this too, which causes all these 3-5% pump and dumps. 
Thus, we are forming all the time the Bartin Simpsons Patterns. 

4: Similarity to 2014: 
Bitcoin -1.03%  now: 






Bitcoin -1.03%  2014: 







5: Deminishing downtrend and a strong support 
If we see the falling  wedges  as the force of the downtrend, then the force is diminishing! 
Furthermore we have strong support which is holding now for the 4th time! 







6: The Indicators 
Having a look at the indicators at 2D, we have a good potential for an upwave now. 
The  volume  is deminishing which should indicate a breakout soon. 
The  MACD  is about to cross, the  RSI  was slightly overbought and is heading up like the  Stoch .  RSI . 
The 200  EMA  is slighty under the current price and act as a support. 

7: The symetrical Triangle 
The theory says, that we should have in a  sym -1.72% . triangle 5 times an  ABC  wave. The waves are not perfect, but we can construct them. 






As you can see, the last four ABC-Waves formed always a 1:1 extention, which indicates that we have finished wave 5. 

8: A possible Head and Shoulders 
Even if this is not the most perfect  Head and Shoulders  Pattern, it's still valid! 
We are currently at the neckline, which is a strong and important resistance. Breaking upwards should indicate a good uptrend. 







9: The magic  6th 0.00%  of the month 






Suprisingly we have on every  6th 0.00%  of the month a reversal. Why is that??? 
One reason could be the  CME Group Futures  with dates for the settlements always nearby the  6th 0.00%  of the month! 
http://www.cmegroup.com 

10: Longterm  Bullish  TA 
The whole pattern could be seen as a big  bullish pennant . 







11: Shortterm  Bullish  TA 
Leading diagonal  starting wave1 of an  Elliott Wave , since we have now an impulse wave, after the 5x  ABC  pattern inside the triangle is finished. 
Our target should be at the top of the triangle nearby 8600-8800$. 







12: Longterm  Bearish  TA 
We also can argue, that we are currenty in an downtrend and the  sym -1.72% . triangle just continuing the trend. 
Our target should be nearby 6000$ which is also a finished downwards  Elliott Wave .

Nothing is happening in the market:  volatility  has become extinct and coins' trading fallen out of fashion. Range-bound bots and robotic humans absolutely prosper in this environment. The price was unable to break the 7700 threshold. For me this is a  bearish  signal. Indicators provide mixed signals, so let's examine wave structure. The move from May 29 is a  3-wave -0.12%  correction within a larger downtrend. A price drop below 7500 would confirm this scenario.

					Impulse Wave Truncation (Truncated Fifth) - 
Truncated 5th wave is when the market has become so over-extended in Wave 3 that there is not much force left for the impulse wave to come to a proper completion. So when this happens, there is a chance that the last wave of the impulse, Wave 5, will not reach the end of Wave 3 before the market starts correcting in the opposite direction. At this point, the market is just too exhausted. This condition is often called a “failure” or a “Truncation.”

I can see many people still believe that we are going inside a  descending triangle . I also believed this in my idea that i shard on may 1st: 



 

Things can change so quickly and if we didn't adapt to the changes then someone will. That's why i believe that we have to be in fast adapt mode in this market. Doesn't mean that you need to change without checking yourself. I try to find 2-3 confirmations before i change my idea on something. This includes pattern changes, trend changes etc 

There are 21 corrective wave patterns in EW which is categorized into major 3 corrective wave patterns: 

Zigzag  (5-3-5) 
Flat (3-3-5) 
Triangle (3-3-3-3-3) 

And other patterns are combinations of the above which is:  

Double three (A combination of two corrective patterns above) 
Triple three (A combination of three corrective patterns above) 

So what i can see now is that we are in two double three combination corrective wave pattern:

https://elliottwave-forecast.com/elliott-wave-theory/#corrective-waves 

Confirmations: 

1. Wave ((i)) of C is 1.6k and ((v)) is going to be completed below the triangle 
2. Wave (E) of the triangle can't go beyond the triangle.  
3. This has happened twice before in 2013 & 2015 

Each wave  got 3 subwaves (a,b &c) inside and we are in the subwave c of ((y)) of Y which is an impulsive wave. 

Impulsive waves: 1,3,5,a,c 
Corrective waves: 2,4,b 

Normal Fibo Ratios for these waves are: 

wave 2 = 0.5 - 0.8 of wave 1  
wave 3 = 1.236 - 1.618 of wave 1  
wave 4 = 0.5 - 0.618 of wave 3  
wave 5 = 0.618 - 1 of wave 1  
wave B = 0.5 - 0.8 of wave A  
wave C = 0.618 - 1.236 of wave A  

Now if you check what happened in subwave a of ((y)) of Y you can see that: 

Wave (i) of a: 985$ 
Wave (ii) of a: 434$  
Wave ( iii -0.63% ) of a: 1207$  
Wave (iv) of a: 691$ [~0.618 of Wave ( iii -0.63% )] 
Wave (v) of a: 950$  








I have seen  BTC -1.03%  impulsive waves fibo ratios almost the same as the previous impulsive wave fibo ratios. 
Now if you apply the same for the last wave C of (E) this is what you get: 

Wave ((i)) of c: 1587$ 
Wave ((ii)) of c  = 793$ 
Wave (( iii -0.63% )) of c  = 1961$ 
Wave ((iv)) of c [~0.618 of Wave (( iii -0.63% ))] = 1212$ 
Wave ((v)) of c  = 1587$ 








Also note that Wave ((iv)) might not retrace upto 0.618 of Wave (( iii -0.63% )) as everyone will be in panic mode by that time so minimum retracement would be around 0.386 of Wave (( iii -0.63% )) which is around 756$ and this is why i can see it goes down to 5k level or little bit more towards 4.7k which is the lowest level of the  support zone  (orange dotted lines) 








So 3 Possible Support lines for reversal would be 

1. Blue: 5800 - 6100 (Only possible if Wave ((v)) is truncated) 
2. Orange: 4700 - 5000 (This is most likely where we heading)  
3. Red: 4100 - 4400 (Only possible if Wave (( iii -0.63% )) is extended)

 Bitcoin -1.03%  has recently developed an interesting pattern of completing a  bullish  and  bearish  cycle on the sixth of every month in an alternating order. As we can see in the chart above, a fall is followed by a rise. This has happened twice before and is expected to happen again now on the  6th 0.00%  of June, 2018. This time  Bitcoin -1.03%  will finish a  bearish  cycle and I expected to begin the next  bullish  cycle at least till the end of  6th 0.00%  of July, 2018. 

This pattern of rise and fall is also supported by other patterns on the chart that signal a  bullish  reversal. The support line has also held firmly and if this pattern of alternating rise and fall ensues,  Bitcoin -1.03%  could very well make new highs by the end of the year. The  RSI  is recovering from oversold levels and has now approached a normal.  Bitcoin -1.03%  is currently at a favorable point for  bullish  entries. The price broke a long term resistance as it break past the downtrend line in April, 2018. This was a big accomplishment for the bulls but the lack of confidence pulled the price back to the support line. Currently, the price is just above the support line and appears to be all set for a  bullish  comeback but the reality is, there are not enough bulls in the market. 

The past few months have been devastating for the price of  Bitcoin -1.03%  ( BTC -1.03% ) and a lot of investors are still running scared. Institutional investors are looking for more clarity regarding regulations concerning cryptocurrencies and also safer ways to invest and store their coins. As for retail investors, most of them comprise of first time investors who have never traded any financial asset before. So, when they saw that  Bitcoin -1.03%  ( BTC -1.03% ) is making 20% gains every day, they thought this could go on forever and jumped with both feet, only to find the carpet pulled under from their feet. Big investors have always played small investors as cannon fodder and have gotten away with their schemes even in regulated markets like forex or the stock market. Cryptocurrencies is a new market with no proper regulations which means it is natural to expect that those who can afford to not play by the rules, most likely won’t.

Hello friends,  

It's been a while since my last post; lack of time and an urge to do more research has mainly driven me to take a break from posting ideas on TradingView. I am still in the process of doing more research and study, but I figure posting once in a while couldn't hurt. 

Since I have become recently very convinced about this, I am outlining a very possible situation with  Bitcoin -1.03%  where the  trend line  we have been on since early October breaks, reaching around a temporary low of $5000. This is examined on the  daily chart , since this is one of the best charts to examine trends of this size. I have to first and foremost say that I am not trying to spread fear, I know many people do not like to hear  bearish  ideas, but  technical analysis  is ultimately a rational exercise, and I feel that possibilities with very strong signs should be explored. 

There are a few things to look at, but I first want to talk about the big picture with, long-term  support and resistance  lines. I think most people can agree that there was a very significant downtrending resistance line that began from the peak of the  ATH 0.63%  in late December, to the low of around $6400 (thick red line). After the break from that line, it seems we moved into a sideways trend, bouncing back and forth between an emerging downtrending resistance line (light red) and a support line that we seem to have been respecting since mid-October (light green); at least this appears to be the case with the lows, where the angle's effectiveness appears very strongly. Finally, based on previous bounces, we can establish a support of around $5000-$5300 (I've thus created a small  support zone  around that range, in dark green), as well as lower supports around $3200 and $2000 (though I do not believe these will be reached, in dark green).   

Now, onto the analysis - it's no secret that  Bitcoin -1.03%  has been squeezing in, ready for a significant move either upwards or downwards. Initially I considered the upwards move to be more likely due to the significant media attention cryptocurrency has been receiving, but after viewing previous market cycles of  Bitcoin -1.03%  (check 2013), it seems clear to me that the  bearish  scenario of closing in on the market cycle is very likely, and should at the very least be prepared for with proper risk management. According to Dow Theory, which is said to have laid the foundations of modern  technical analysis , history repeats itself, and this is a situation where we forced to consider this. 

Should we break from the line, we will likely fall straight down to the $5000-$5000 area, where we will shoot back up and bounce towards around $6700 or so (maybe a little less). From there one, we will likely enter a sideways trend, which we will continue until we see higher highs and higher lows and parabolic movement returns, which could lead to us challenging the all-time high, and hitting $35k-$50k. 

NOTE: I seem to have reached the max character limit for this section of the idea, so I will continue my text below.

Comment:
					Onto the short-term: 


Scenario A: 

The reason why I have drawn this movement into a pennant is this way, is simply because we have been moving through this ascending triangle for quite a while now (May 23rd to today). I don't think that the pattern will be sufficient to directly lead into a strong sell-off, but we should consider that the size of ascending triangle suggests a small movement downwards at the very least, which can create a higher low, and thus move into position into a bearish pennant. Why would a bearish pennant occur here and not have a bounce to $8500-$8700? The reason is in positioning - the huge downtrend (May 5th to May 26th) creates a very nice flagpole in which it hits around the $5000 area very perfectly, and thus I would not be surprised if this happens. 

Second reason: on the Stoch RSI indicator on the daily chart, it appears to be dangerously high, which would suggest it being oversold. For the most part, it seems to have called lows and highs, at least to some extent. This overdrawn movement may very well have increased the likelyhood of Bitcoin being oversold. This could suggest that this is the last step into a sharp downturn, but this does not preclude Situation B. Volume has also been steadily decreasing, but this is the case with any sort of consolidation, I believe. 

Finally, the lines I have drawn below the triangle are simply bounces that I think seem fairly reasonable. The length from to support to the lines correlate with the length of the flagpole, of course, though it may seem chopped off due to the huge line from the long-term support downwards. 


Scenario B: 

This is much simpler, Bitcoin hits the upper resistance line, bounces off, challenges the lower support line, and we potentially see a break, and the rest unfolds from there. 


----------------------------------------------------------------------- 


With all this being said, do not fear if you are hoping for more parabolic movement - this likely will not be the end, and will simply be the set up for a long, drawn out sideways movement until the first signs of bullish activity begin and we start all over again. If you are longing around here, please consider using risk management, prepare for every possibility. If you are shorting, the same applies. 

Please trade with care. I wish the best to all traders!

Comment:
					This really is a very minor note, but I just want to emphasize that the rising wedge (which I erroneously refer to as an ascending triangle, a bad habit I have) entering a bearish pennant is more based on intuition than anything. Also, this pennant is mainly based on the conservative assumption that the break will happen at 7900, if it happens at 7700 where we seem to be general resistance, the pennant would look something like this:

Jun 7




I am Mid term-bullish on  BTC -1.03%  going into the end of this week, but looking to get into the market on a pull back to occur before I get in to the market.  The jury is still out as to whether this weekly bear trend is ready to turn around.  

We can see that both the  RSI  and  MFI  are both  Bullish  on the daily having bottomed when reaching oversold on both at c. $7k support where we found our longer term  trend line . 

We are currently in the process of meeting the Tenkan (blue line) as I write this, so in the very short term, I am looking for a pull back to $7550 range for an entry.  One of the main reasons for this is that on the 4hour timeframes we are close to completing an edge to edge trade so the risk reward doesn’t fit my profile, however a break out from the cloud or above the Tenkan around $7777 will make me enter the market. 

The  RSI  and  MFI  have both been excellent indicators in this bear market.  Whenever  RSI  has gone above the 60 and the  MFI  80; its time to exit the market from a  bullish  trade and consider shorting as it progresses higher.   

Based on the  RSI ,  MFI  trends and the fact that we will run into the Kijun at just around $8-8.2k, I will be scalling out at this  bearish  confluence level to start looking for pull backs and reassessment as i believe it to be a key point as  

Best case scenario this trade would yield a 10% return before leverage. 
This is for illustrative purposes only, please DYOR and goodluck with your trading.

So the pullback trade that we were looking at worked out & has made it's way back to the neckline level of structure. We are now at what i like to call a ""decision point"" Essentially IF price is able to violate this current level od structure THEN we're likely to continue to our next price projection.  

Something that a lot of newer traders don't understand is that when it comes to bigger moves, the market will often provide multiple opportunities to get involved. For those who don't rush and for those who don't get discouraged. If you perform consistent analysis you can often find multiple ways to involve yourself in a trade even if you missed the first strike.

Recent price action has clear signs of wash trading / market manipulation fud and lots of nonsense. Its hard to prove almost impossible so as a trader we just need to deal with it. Ideally the situation you are supposed to trade are critical break up and break down points to enter the trade. Dont enter or exit dumb trades and lose money.

I am never good with words so instead of writing paragraphs of clarification to justify my call for SHORT since my last posting, I have explained everything on my chart with the least words possible using Fibonacci. It does not matter how popular  Bitcoin -1.08%  has become, or how deep it has disrupted the financial sector, or how many institutional investors have come to invest in it -- the psychology behind a market cycle does not change. 

I don't really encourage anyone to short  Bitcoin -1.08% , but in all honesty, don't expect the bulls to fly anytime soon. Like I said before, this correction that we are having right now is the ""MOTHER OF ALL CORRECTIONS"" after a 4-year-long bull cycle since the 2013 correction... and we are just halfway through.

My best idea ever, taking some time off the last 2 days :) The whales just continue to play their little games by squeezing leveraged short and long positions out of the market. Can't play them, it's just too easy. Maybe it's time we retail traders stand together, combine our  volume  and use their own game against them. Yeah, maybe we could even make a blockbuster movie about this :) I love me some science fiction :) LOL  

My last update of the previous analysis i showed 2 important support levels where the price could bounce up from. The first support around 7350 did the trick and the price got pushed back to 7700. From that point on i told my members that i thought i was seeing distribution, but it was still very confusing to figure out what was going on. TA was showing  bullish  signs, that  bull flag  was very strong and was even turning slowly up and was about to squeeze upwards. But of course out of no where the price got dumped, the move we saw a few hours ago. After that 200 point drop the price got pushed up again to 7700 like that dump was a glitch. If your a whale, why not push out leveraged traders and take your money while your accumulating or distributing. It's like a bonus, like the cherry on top :)  

Anyway, in this chart we can see allot of similarities of what is going on. As you know i have been saying i am still  bearish  for the medium term, but i just could not say what was going to happen on the short term. 2 days ago after we finally dropped out of that  wedge , i said we would have 2 options.  
- Break those 2 support levels from the last update of my previous chart (73xx and 71xx) 
- Make a higher low at those same support levels and make another move up above the high.  
 
As we can see in the chart, the  fractal  is not 100% identical so it's no guarantee that the 7700 high we just saw is the high already and that we start to move down. But based on this  fractal , i don't want to see the price get above the 7800/7900. This  fractal  confirms my  bearish  view as well. That's why TA is so great, you can turn any chart to fit your view :). 

Even without this  fractal , i just give it a very small chance that 7K price action is the fundament of a low to start another bull rally, i just highly doubt that. I want to see more  volume  to begin with and at least  double bottom  kind of formation. So the minimum i expect is a test of the 7100/6900in the coming week or 2. But the movement i have in mind for the med term is a drop below the 7K to form a big V shape low. If we get to see that, than i might even become  bullish  for the rest of the year :).  

As long as the price stays above the 73xx, we have to assume the bulls are still in control and we should see another wave up. So for me the 73xx is an important turning point.

					This is my bigger picture, think this bearish triangle is still 100% in play. I think if bulls can't break the 7800/7900 the bearish version is probably going to happen. Can't say HOW it will go, this blue line is just a guess. But a big V shape low would be the most bullish for the long term. I still think we are seeing distribution here. The only way this idea can be countered, is through a big increase of buying volume, if that doesn't happen, i think it's only a matter of time.

The price took a small dump but the volume was low so no real read on what the intent was. So we might see another move up, if we start to see a small pump that takes out the 7800, be aware of a fake breakout. The blue line is a possibility of what the move could look like IF we move up and if the breakout fails. If that happens than we will probably get confirmation if the price breaks the 7600ish. If we break the 7800 it should stay above the 7700 to confirm another move up. Not much more to say about what's going on.

253,1528359434.0,Taiwan_Bear,2618 (Double top & 0.618 pull-back) - do not miss it!!,"
In the last couple of TAs I have mentioned the “2618 pattern” and have been asked what 2618 means. Sorry for taking it so long as it took me quite a while to put everything altogether. But, as promised, I have explained below the rules and trade setups for the 2618 pattern.  

What are the rules/setups/steps for 2618?  
1.	Form a  double top  (Note #1)  
2.	Neckline has to be broken  
3.	After price found support at point (b), wait for pull back to 0.618 fib retracement of (a)(b)  
4.	After price retraced to 0.618, look for confluence and sell (eg. Structures,  trendlines  ,  double top  on a lower time frame,  rsi  divergence,  bearish pin bar  ,  inside bar  break down etc.) (Note #2)  
5.	Stop loss to be set above  double top 
6.	Set Take Profit levels (Note #3)  

Note #1 ( Double top ):  
The first step for the formation of 2618 is to form a  double top  at key resistance levels. Why at key resistance levels? Because we want to avoid fake double tops which can occur occasionally.  

There are some variations between various resources (books, websites) regarding the definitions of “double top”. The main differences occur where:  
a)	Some said for a  double top  to be valid, the wick of the 2nd top cannot exceed the wick of the 1st top; whereas, others said:  
b)	The wick of the 2nd top can exceed the wick of the 1st top but the candle close of the 2nd top CANNOT exceed the wick of the 1st top; or  
c)	The wick of the 2nd top can exceed the wick of the 1st top and the candle close of the 2nd top CAN exceed the wick of the 1st top; or  
d)	The wick of the 2nd top meets at least the candle close of the 1st top; or  
e)	The body of the 2nd top cannot exceed the body of the 1st top  

Personally, I would say all the above definitions work just fine although I do prefer definition a) because it means that the selling pressure is strong and the bulls fail to make a higher high. When there is a higher high formed in a downtrend, it can mean the downtrend has reversed and therefore you might not want to sell when the price pulls back to the 0.618 fib retracement.  

Note #2 ( 0.618 retracement ):  
When the price pulls back to 0.618, it does not mean to sell straight away. There must be more than one reason to sell other than the 0.618 retrace. The more reasons the better. In this example, you can see there are certainly structures (key resistance levels) at the 0.618 retrace. As well, there was a  double top  formed on the lower time frame. Consequently, you can sell.  

After  BTC -1.11%  hit the 0.618 retrace the first time, the price dropped from $9735 to $8650. but quickly bounced back to the 0.618 retrace level. That was a second & better opportunity to sell. Not only did  BTC -1.11%  form a  double top  on the larger time frame, but also with a  bearish  divergence on the 4hr time frame. Accordingly, you have more reasons to sell.  

Note #3 (Set take profit)  
Same as the rules of “Double top”, there are some variations as to which price level should you take profits. Personally, I would stick to the below:  
1)	First, take profit when risk/reward ratio hits 1:1 (recommend to take 30% - 50% profits and adjust the SL of the remaining positions to break-even)  
2)	When price hits the same price level as the low after the neckline is broken ((b) point in this example)  
3)	When price hits 1.272 fib extension of (a)(b)  
4)	When price hits point (d) (using  AB=CD  pattern. If you are not sure what the rules of  AB=CD  are, you can refer to my previous TA in which I have attached the link below)  
5)	If in a one-way market (heavily bearish/bullish), you can always keep 10% to 20% of your positions and take profits when risk/reward ratio hits 1:5 or even 1:10

 BTC -1.11%  is on the verge of breaking to a daily higher high on the bounce if the bulls can see a push this morning. 
If we reject from here the daily will form a lower high and we will see a tightening pattern within the highlighted  support and resistance  lines.  
Important for the bulls to show up or we could stay in this range into tomorrow.  
Healthy consolidation after the most recent bull move and the 15 min chart needs to change the trend.  
Also look to  EMA  12 support on the 4 hour and hourly.  
Another morning like yesterday with the bulls comfortable as worst case, we likely stay in the tightening pattern if bulls cannot prove themselves.

The current situation of  Bitcoin -1.11%  is quite difficult. We are on a clear treshold. A lot of traders are saying that we are on a clear downtrend, but the same amount of people are claiming that we will have our reversal soon. 

This article tries to sum up all important information you have to need! 

1: Retracement of a parabolic uptrend: 
There is a rule of thumb for the retracement of a parabolic uptrend. We should retrace to approx. the 0.786  Fibonacci Retracement  +/- 10%! 
Depending where we start the count, we are already in that target. Although both ways (blue and red) have still some space for a further downwave! 







2: The bloody support of Bitcoin: 
The average cost of mining one  bitcoin -1.11%  are at USA/Russia approx. 4700$ and at 3100$ for china! 
A drop below a target of 4700$ would be savage. Nevertheless, i can't image that we will hit that target. 







3: Manipulation of  Bitcoin -1.11%  and the Bart Simpson Pattern: 
A friend of mine found some unusual patterns in the orderbooks of several exchanges: 
https://twitter.com/CryptoSyndrome 
Altcoins are manipulated on a daily basis. It seems that  bitcoin -1.11%  is now affected to this too, which causes all these 3-5% pump and dumps. 
Thus, we are forming all the time the Bartin Simpsons Patterns. 

4: Similarity to 2014: 
Bitcoin -1.11%  now: 






Bitcoin -1.11%  2014: 







5: Deminishing downtrend and a strong support 
If we see the falling  wedges  as the force of the downtrend, then the force is diminishing! 
Furthermore we have strong support which is holding now for the 4th time! 







6: The Indicators 
Having a look at the indicators at 2D, we have a good potential for an upwave now. 
The  volume  is deminishing which should indicate a breakout soon. 
The  MACD  is about to cross, the  RSI  was slightly overbought and is heading up like the  Stoch .  RSI . 
The 200  EMA  is slighty under the current price and act as a support. 

7: The symetrical Triangle 
The theory says, that we should have in a  sym -0.80% . triangle 5 times an  ABC  wave. The waves are not perfect, but we can construct them. 






As you can see, the last four ABC-Waves formed always a 1:1 extention, which indicates that we have finished wave 5. 

8: A possible Head and Shoulders 
Even if this is not the most perfect  Head and Shoulders  Pattern, it's still valid! 
We are currently at the neckline, which is a strong and important resistance. Breaking upwards should indicate a good uptrend. 







9: The magic  6th 0.00%  of the month 






Suprisingly we have on every  6th 0.00%  of the month a reversal. Why is that??? 
One reason could be the  CME Group Futures  with dates for the settlements always nearby the  6th 0.00%  of the month! 
http://www.cmegroup.com 

10: Longterm  Bullish  TA 
The whole pattern could be seen as a big  bullish pennant . 







11: Shortterm  Bullish  TA 
Leading diagonal  starting wave1 of an  Elliott Wave , since we have now an impulse wave, after the 5x  ABC  pattern inside the triangle is finished. 
Our target should be at the top of the triangle nearby 8600-8800$. 







12: Longterm  Bearish  TA 
We also can argue, that we are currenty in an downtrend and the  sym -0.80% . triangle just continuing the trend. 
Our target should be nearby 6000$ which is also a finished downwards  Elliott Wave .

Nothing is happening in the market:  volatility  has become extinct and coins' trading fallen out of fashion. Range-bound bots and robotic humans absolutely prosper in this environment. The price was unable to break the 7700 threshold. For me this is a  bearish  signal. Indicators provide mixed signals, so let's examine wave structure. The move from May 29 is a  3-wave -0.12%  correction within a larger downtrend. A price drop below 7500 would confirm this scenario.

					Impulse Wave Truncation (Truncated Fifth) - 
Truncated 5th wave is when the market has become so over-extended in Wave 3 that there is not much force left for the impulse wave to come to a proper completion. So when this happens, there is a chance that the last wave of the impulse, Wave 5, will not reach the end of Wave 3 before the market starts correcting in the opposite direction. At this point, the market is just too exhausted. This condition is often called a “failure” or a “Truncation.”

I can see many people still believe that we are going inside a  descending triangle . I also believed this in my idea that i shard on may 1st: 



 

Things can change so quickly and if we didn't adapt to the changes then someone will. That's why i believe that we have to be in fast adapt mode in this market. Doesn't mean that you need to change without checking yourself. I try to find 2-3 confirmations before i change my idea on something. This includes pattern changes, trend changes etc 

There are 21 corrective wave patterns in EW which is categorized into major 3 corrective wave patterns: 

Zigzag  (5-3-5) 
Flat (3-3-5) 
Triangle (3-3-3-3-3) 

And other patterns are combinations of the above which is:  

Double three (A combination of two corrective patterns above) 
Triple three (A combination of three corrective patterns above) 

So what i can see now is that we are in two double three combination corrective wave pattern: 








More info here:  

https://elliottwave-forecast.com/elliott-wave-theory/#corrective-waves 

Confirmations: 

1. Wave ((i)) of C is 1.6k and ((v)) is going to be completed below the triangle 
2. Wave (E) of the triangle can't go beyond the triangle.  
3. This has happened twice before in 2013 & 2015 

Each wave  got 3 subwaves (a,b &c) inside and we are in the subwave c of ((y)) of Y which is an impulsive wave. 

Impulsive waves: 1,3,5,a,c 
Corrective waves: 2,4,b 

Normal Fibo Ratios for these waves are: 

wave 2 = 0.5 - 0.8 of wave 1  
wave 3 = 1.236 - 1.618 of wave 1  
wave 4 = 0.5 - 0.618 of wave 3  
wave 5 = 0.618 - 1 of wave 1  
wave B = 0.5 - 0.8 of wave A  
wave C = 0.618 - 1.236 of wave A  

Now if you check what happened in subwave a of ((y)) of Y you can see that: 

Wave (i) of a: 985$ 
Wave (ii) of a: 434$  
Wave ( iii 0.03% ) of a: 1207$  
Wave (iv) of a: 691$ [~0.618 of Wave ( iii 0.03% )] 
Wave (v) of a: 950$  








I have seen  BTC -1.11%  impulsive waves fibo ratios almost the same as the previous impulsive wave fibo ratios. 
Now if you apply the same for the last wave C of (E) this is what you get: 

Wave ((i)) of c: 1587$ 
Wave ((ii)) of c  = 793$ 
Wave (( iii 0.03% )) of c  = 1961$ 
Wave ((iv)) of c [~0.618 of Wave (( iii 0.03% ))] = 1212$ 
Wave ((v)) of c  = 1587$ 








Also note that Wave ((iv)) might not retrace upto 0.618 of Wave (( iii 0.03% )) as everyone will be in panic mode by that time so minimum retracement would be around 0.386 of Wave (( iii 0.03% )) which is around 756$ and this is why i can see it goes down to 5k level or little bit more towards 4.7k which is the lowest level of the  support zone  (orange dotted lines) 








So 3 Possible Support lines for reversal would be 

1. Blue: 5800 - 6100 (Only possible if Wave ((v)) is truncated) 
2. Orange: 4700 - 5000 (This is most likely where we heading)  
3. Red: 4100 - 4400 (Only possible if Wave (( iii 0.03% )) is extended)

 Bitcoin -1.11%  has recently developed an interesting pattern of completing a  bullish  and  bearish  cycle on the sixth of every month in an alternating order. As we can see in the chart above, a fall is followed by a rise. This has happened twice before and is expected to happen again now on the  6th 0.00%  of June, 2018. This time  Bitcoin -1.11%  will finish a  bearish  cycle and I expected to begin the next  bullish  cycle at least till the end of  6th 0.00%  of July, 2018. 

This pattern of rise and fall is also supported by other patterns on the chart that signal a  bullish  reversal. The support line has also held firmly and if this pattern of alternating rise and fall ensues,  Bitcoin -1.11%  could very well make new highs by the end of the year. The  RSI  is recovering from oversold levels and has now approached a normal.  Bitcoin -1.11%  is currently at a favorable point for  bullish  entries. The price broke a long term resistance as it break past the downtrend line in April, 2018. This was a big accomplishment for the bulls but the lack of confidence pulled the price back to the support line. Currently, the price is just above the support line and appears to be all set for a  bullish  comeback but the reality is, there are not enough bulls in the market. 

The past few months have been devastating for the price of  Bitcoin -1.11%  ( BTC -1.11% ) and a lot of investors are still running scared. Institutional investors are looking for more clarity regarding regulations concerning cryptocurrencies and also safer ways to invest and store their coins. As for retail investors, most of them comprise of first time investors who have never traded any financial asset before. So, when they saw that  Bitcoin -1.11%  ( BTC -1.11% ) is making 20% gains every day, they thought this could go on forever and jumped with both feet, only to find the carpet pulled under from their feet. Big investors have always played small investors as cannon fodder and have gotten away with their schemes even in regulated markets like forex or the stock market. Cryptocurrencies is a new market with no proper regulations which means it is natural to expect that those who can afford to not play by the rules, most likely won’t.

Hello friends,  

It's been a while since my last post; lack of time and an urge to do more research has mainly driven me to take a break from posting ideas on TradingView. I am still in the process of doing more research and study, but I figure posting once in a while couldn't hurt. 

Since I have become recently very convinced about this, I am outlining a very possible situation with  Bitcoin -1.13%  where the  trend line  we have been on since early October breaks, reaching around a temporary low of $5000. This is examined on the  daily chart , since this is one of the best charts to examine trends of this size. I have to first and foremost say that I am not trying to spread fear, I know many people do not like to hear  bearish  ideas, but  technical analysis  is ultimately a rational exercise, and I feel that possibilities with very strong signs should be explored. 

There are a few things to look at, but I first want to talk about the big picture with, long-term  support and resistance  lines. I think most people can agree that there was a very significant downtrending resistance line that began from the peak of the  ATH 0.63%  in late December, to the low of around $6400 (thick red line). After the break from that line, it seems we moved into a sideways trend, bouncing back and forth between an emerging downtrending resistance line (light red) and a support line that we seem to have been respecting since mid-October (light green); at least this appears to be the case with the lows, where the angle's effectiveness appears very strongly. Finally, based on previous bounces, we can establish a support of around $5000-$5300 (I've thus created a small  support zone  around that range, in dark green), as well as lower supports around $3200 and $2000 (though I do not believe these will be reached, in dark green).   

Now, onto the analysis - it's no secret that  Bitcoin -1.13%  has been squeezing in, ready for a significant move either upwards or downwards. Initially I considered the upwards move to be more likely due to the significant media attention cryptocurrency has been receiving, but after viewing previous market cycles of  Bitcoin -1.13%  (check 2013), it seems clear to me that the  bearish  scenario of closing in on the market cycle is very likely, and should at the very least be prepared for with proper risk management. According to Dow Theory, which is said to have laid the foundations of modern  technical analysis , history repeats itself, and this is a situation where we forced to consider this. 

Should we break from the line, we will likely fall straight down to the $5000-$5000 area, where we will shoot back up and bounce towards around $6700 or so (maybe a little less). From there one, we will likely enter a sideways trend, which we will continue until we see higher highs and higher lows and parabolic movement returns, which could lead to us challenging the all-time high, and hitting $35k-$50k. 

NOTE: I seem to have reached the max character limit for this section of the idea, so I will continue my text below.

Comment:
					Onto the short-term: 


Scenario A: 

The reason why I have drawn this movement into a pennant is this way, is simply because we have been moving through this ascending triangle for quite a while now (May 23rd to today). I don't think that the pattern will be sufficient to directly lead into a strong sell-off, but we should consider that the size of ascending triangle suggests a small movement downwards at the very least, which can create a higher low, and thus move into position into a bearish pennant. Why would a bearish pennant occur here and not have a bounce to $8500-$8700? The reason is in positioning - the huge downtrend (May 5th to May 26th) creates a very nice flagpole in which it hits around the $5000 area very perfectly, and thus I would not be surprised if this happens. 

Second reason: on the Stoch RSI indicator on the daily chart, it appears to be dangerously high, which would suggest it being oversold. For the most part, it seems to have called lows and highs, at least to some extent. This overdrawn movement may very well have increased the likelyhood of Bitcoin being oversold. This could suggest that this is the last step into a sharp downturn, but this does not preclude Situation B. Volume has also been steadily decreasing, but this is the case with any sort of consolidation, I believe. 

Finally, the lines I have drawn below the triangle are simply bounces that I think seem fairly reasonable. The length from to support to the lines correlate with the length of the flagpole, of course, though it may seem chopped off due to the huge line from the long-term support downwards. 


Scenario B: 

This is much simpler, Bitcoin hits the upper resistance line, bounces off, challenges the lower support line, and we potentially see a break, and the rest unfolds from there. 


----------------------------------------------------------------------- 


With all this being said, do not fear if you are hoping for more parabolic movement - this likely will not be the end, and will simply be the set up for a long, drawn out sideways movement until the first signs of bullish activity begin and we start all over again. If you are longing around here, please consider using risk management, prepare for every possibility. If you are shorting, the same applies. 

Please trade with care. I wish the best to all traders!

Comment:
					This really is a very minor note, but I just want to emphasize that the rising wedge (which I erroneously refer to as an ascending triangle, a bad habit I have) entering a bearish pennant is more based on intuition than anything. Also, this pennant is mainly based on the conservative assumption that the break will happen at 7900, if it happens at 7700 where we seem to be general resistance, the pennant would look something like this:

Jun 7




I am Mid term-bullish on  BTC -1.13%  going into the end of this week, but looking to get into the market on a pull back to occur before I get in to the market.  The jury is still out as to whether this weekly bear trend is ready to turn around.  

We can see that both the  RSI  and  MFI  are both  Bullish  on the daily having bottomed when reaching oversold on both at c. $7k support where we found our longer term  trend line . 

We are currently in the process of meeting the Tenkan (blue line) as I write this, so in the very short term, I am looking for a pull back to $7550 range for an entry.  One of the main reasons for this is that on the 4hour timeframes we are close to completing an edge to edge trade so the risk reward doesn’t fit my profile, however a break out from the cloud or above the Tenkan around $7777 will make me enter the market. 

The  RSI  and  MFI  have both been excellent indicators in this bear market.  Whenever  RSI  has gone above the 60 and the  MFI  80; its time to exit the market from a  bullish  trade and consider shorting as it progresses higher.   

Based on the  RSI ,  MFI  trends and the fact that we will run into the Kijun at just around $8-8.2k, I will be scalling out at this  bearish  confluence level to start looking for pull backs and reassessment as i believe it to be a key point as  

Best case scenario this trade would yield a 10% return before leverage. 
This is for illustrative purposes only, please DYOR and goodluck with your trading.

So the pullback trade that we were looking at worked out & has made it's way back to the neckline level of structure. We are now at what i like to call a ""decision point"" Essentially IF price is able to violate this current level od structure THEN we're likely to continue to our next price projection.  

Something that a lot of newer traders don't understand is that when it comes to bigger moves, the market will often provide multiple opportunities to get involved. For those who don't rush and for those who don't get discouraged. If you perform consistent analysis you can often find multiple ways to involve yourself in a trade even if you missed the first strike.

Recent price action has clear signs of wash trading / market manipulation fud and lots of nonsense. Its hard to prove almost impossible so as a trader we just need to deal with it. Ideally the situation you are supposed to trade are critical break up and break down points to enter the trade. Dont enter or exit dumb trades and lose money.

My best idea ever, taking some time off the last 2 days :) The whales just continue to play their little games by squeezing leveraged short and long positions out of the market. Can't play them, it's just too easy. Maybe it's time we retail traders stand together, combine our  volume  and use their own game against them. Yeah, maybe we could even make a blockbuster movie about this :) I love me some science fiction :) LOL  

My last update of the previous analysis i showed 2 important support levels where the price could bounce up from. The first support around 7350 did the trick and the price got pushed back to 7700. From that point on i told my members that i thought i was seeing distribution, but it was still very confusing to figure out what was going on. TA was showing  bullish  signs, that  bull flag  was very strong and was even turning slowly up and was about to squeeze upwards. But of course out of no where the price got dumped, the move we saw a few hours ago. After that 200 point drop the price got pushed up again to 7700 like that dump was a glitch. If your a whale, why not push out leveraged traders and take your money while your accumulating or distributing. It's like a bonus, like the cherry on top :)  

Anyway, in this chart we can see allot of similarities of what is going on. As you know i have been saying i am still  bearish  for the medium term, but i just could not say what was going to happen on the short term. 2 days ago after we finally dropped out of that  wedge , i said we would have 2 options.  
- Break those 2 support levels from the last update of my previous chart (73xx and 71xx) 
- Make a higher low at those same support levels and make another move up above the high.  
 
As we can see in the chart, the  fractal  is not 100% identical so it's no guarantee that the 7700 high we just saw is the high already and that we start to move down. But based on this  fractal , i don't want to see the price get above the 7800/7900. This  fractal  confirms my  bearish  view as well. That's why TA is so great, you can turn any chart to fit your view :). 

Even without this  fractal , i just give it a very small chance that 7K price action is the fundament of a low to start another bull rally, i just highly doubt that. I want to see more  volume  to begin with and at least  double bottom  kind of formation. So the minimum i expect is a test of the 7100/6900in the coming week or 2. But the movement i have in mind for the med term is a drop below the 7K to form a big V shape low. If we get to see that, than i might even become  bullish  for the rest of the year :).  

As long as the price stays above the 73xx, we have to assume the bulls are still in control and we should see another wave up. So for me the 73xx is an important turning point.

Comment:
					At the moment it looks like bulls are trying to push higher, this bull flag/triangle is still very strong. So no sign of weakness yet! First small sign would be a drop below 7620/7600. Bulls need to break 7700

Comment:
					This is my bigger picture, think this bearish triangle is still 100% in play. I think if bulls can't break the 7800/7900 the bearish version is probably going to happen. Can't say HOW it will go, this blue line is just a guess. But a big V shape low would be the most bullish for the long term. I still think we are seeing distribution here. The only way this idea can be countered, is through a big increase of buying volume, if that doesn't happen, i think it's only a matter of time.

Comment:
					Lower time frame we can see a new upwards channel and maybe even a rising wedge. From the looks of it, it's slowly going down to test the support line again. Depending on what will happen there we can make a better prediction for the rest of the day.

					What a surprise, nothing has changed :) 

The price took a small dump but the volume was low so no real read on what the intent was. So we might see another move up, if we start to see a small pump that takes out the 7800, be aware of a fake breakout. The blue line is a possibility of what the move could look like IF we move up and if the breakout fails. If that happens than we will probably get confirmation if the price breaks the 7600ish. If we break the 7800 it should stay above the 7700 to confirm another move up. Not much more to say about what's going on.

271,1528359434.0,Taiwan_Bear,2618 (Double top & 0.618 pull-back) - do not miss it!!,"
In the last couple of TAs I have mentioned the “2618 pattern” and have been asked what 2618 means. Sorry for taking it so long as it took me quite a while to put everything altogether. But, as promised, I have explained below the rules and trade setups for the 2618 pattern.  

What are the rules/setups/steps for 2618?  
1.	Form a  double top  (Note #1)  
2.	Neckline has to be broken  
3.	After price found support at point (b), wait for pull back to 0.618 fib retracement of (a)(b)  
4.	After price retraced to 0.618, look for confluence and sell (eg. Structures,  trendlines  ,  double top  on a lower time frame,  rsi  divergence,  bearish pin bar  ,  inside bar  break down etc.) (Note #2)  
5.	Stop loss to be set above  double top 
6.	Set Take Profit levels (Note #3)  

Note #1 ( Double top ):  
The first step for the formation of 2618 is to form a  double top  at key resistance levels. Why at key resistance levels? Because we want to avoid fake double tops which can occur occasionally.  

There are some variations between various resources (books, websites) regarding the definitions of “double top”. The main differences occur where:  
a)	Some said for a  double top  to be valid, the wick of the 2nd top cannot exceed the wick of the 1st top; whereas, others said:  
b)	The wick of the 2nd top can exceed the wick of the 1st top but the candle close of the 2nd top CANNOT exceed the wick of the 1st top; or  
c)	The wick of the 2nd top can exceed the wick of the 1st top and the candle close of the 2nd top CAN exceed the wick of the 1st top; or  
d)	The wick of the 2nd top meets at least the candle close of the 1st top; or  
e)	The body of the 2nd top cannot exceed the body of the 1st top  

Personally, I would say all the above definitions work just fine although I do prefer definition a) because it means that the selling pressure is strong and the bulls fail to make a higher high. When there is a higher high formed in a downtrend, it can mean the downtrend has reversed and therefore you might not want to sell when the price pulls back to the 0.618 fib retracement.  

Note #2 ( 0.618 retracement ):  
When the price pulls back to 0.618, it does not mean to sell straight away. There must be more than one reason to sell other than the 0.618 retrace. The more reasons the better. In this example, you can see there are certainly structures (key resistance levels) at the 0.618 retrace. As well, there was a  double top  formed on the lower time frame. Consequently, you can sell.  

After  BTC -1.14%  hit the 0.618 retrace the first time, the price dropped from $9735 to $8650. but quickly bounced back to the 0.618 retrace level. That was a second & better opportunity to sell. Not only did  BTC -1.14%  form a  double top  on the larger time frame, but also with a  bearish  divergence on the 4hr time frame. Accordingly, you have more reasons to sell.  

Note #3 (Set take profit)  
Same as the rules of “Double top”, there are some variations as to which price level should you take profits. Personally, I would stick to the below:  
1)	First, take profit when risk/reward ratio hits 1:1 (recommend to take 30% - 50% profits and adjust the SL of the remaining positions to break-even)  
2)	When price hits the same price level as the low after the neckline is broken ((b) point in this example)  
3)	When price hits 1.272 fib extension of (a)(b)  
4)	When price hits point (d) (using  AB=CD  pattern. If you are not sure what the rules of  AB=CD  are, you can refer to my previous TA in which I have attached the link below)  
5)	If in a one-way market (heavily bearish/bullish), you can always keep 10% to 20% of your positions and take profits when risk/reward ratio hits 1:5 or even 1:10

 BTC -1.14%  is on the verge of breaking to a daily higher high on the bounce if the bulls can see a push this morning. 
If we reject from here the daily will form a lower high and we will see a tightening pattern within the highlighted  support and resistance  lines.  
Important for the bulls to show up or we could stay in this range into tomorrow.  
Healthy consolidation after the most recent bull move and the 15 min chart needs to change the trend.  
Also look to  EMA  12 support on the 4 hour and hourly.  
Another morning like yesterday with the bulls comfortable as worst case, we likely stay in the tightening pattern if bulls cannot prove themselves.

The current situation of  Bitcoin -1.14%  is quite difficult. We are on a clear treshold. A lot of traders are saying that we are on a clear downtrend, but the same amount of people are claiming that we will have our reversal soon. 

This article tries to sum up all important information you have to need! 

1: Retracement of a parabolic uptrend: 
There is a rule of thumb for the retracement of a parabolic uptrend. We should retrace to approx. the 0.786  Fibonacci Retracement  +/- 10%! 
Depending where we start the count, we are already in that target. Although both ways (blue and red) have still some space for a further downwave! 







2: The bloody support of Bitcoin: 
The average cost of mining one  bitcoin -1.14%  are at USA/Russia approx. 4700$ and at 3100$ for china! 
A drop below a target of 4700$ would be savage. Nevertheless, i can't image that we will hit that target. 







3: Manipulation of  Bitcoin -1.14%  and the Bart Simpson Pattern: 
A friend of mine found some unusual patterns in the orderbooks of several exchanges: 
https://twitter.com/CryptoSyndrome 
Altcoins are manipulated on a daily basis. It seems that  bitcoin -1.14%  is now affected to this too, which causes all these 3-5% pump and dumps. 
Thus, we are forming all the time the Bartin Simpsons Patterns. 

4: Similarity to 2014: 
Bitcoin -1.14%  now: 






Bitcoin -1.14%  2014: 







5: Deminishing downtrend and a strong support 
If we see the falling  wedges  as the force of the downtrend, then the force is diminishing! 
Furthermore we have strong support which is holding now for the 4th time! 







6: The Indicators 
Having a look at the indicators at 2D, we have a good potential for an upwave now. 
The  volume  is deminishing which should indicate a breakout soon. 
The  MACD  is about to cross, the  RSI  was slightly overbought and is heading up like the  Stoch .  RSI . 
The 200  EMA  is slighty under the current price and act as a support. 

7: The symetrical Triangle 
The theory says, that we should have in a  sym -0.80% . triangle 5 times an  ABC  wave. The waves are not perfect, but we can construct them. 






As you can see, the last four ABC-Waves formed always a 1:1 extention, which indicates that we have finished wave 5. 

8: A possible Head and Shoulders 
Even if this is not the most perfect  Head and Shoulders  Pattern, it's still valid! 
We are currently at the neckline, which is a strong and important resistance. Breaking upwards should indicate a good uptrend. 







9: The magic  6th 0.00%  of the month 






Suprisingly we have on every  6th 0.00%  of the month a reversal. Why is that??? 
One reason could be the  CME Group Futures  with dates for the settlements always nearby the  6th 0.00%  of the month! 
http://www.cmegroup.com 

10: Longterm  Bullish  TA 
The whole pattern could be seen as a big  bullish pennant . 







11: Shortterm  Bullish  TA 
Leading diagonal  starting wave1 of an  Elliott Wave , since we have now an impulse wave, after the 5x  ABC  pattern inside the triangle is finished. 
Our target should be at the top of the triangle nearby 8600-8800$. 







12: Longterm  Bearish  TA 
We also can argue, that we are currenty in an downtrend and the  sym -0.80% . triangle just continuing the trend. 
Our target should be nearby 6000$ which is also a finished downwards  Elliott Wave .

Nothing is happening in the market:  volatility  has become extinct and coins' trading fallen out of fashion. Range-bound bots and robotic humans absolutely prosper in this environment. The price was unable to break the 7700 threshold. For me this is a  bearish  signal. Indicators provide mixed signals, so let's examine wave structure. The move from May 29 is a  3-wave -0.12%  correction within a larger downtrend. A price drop below 7500 would confirm this scenario.

					Impulse Wave Truncation (Truncated Fifth) - 
Truncated 5th wave is when the market has become so over-extended in Wave 3 that there is not much force left for the impulse wave to come to a proper completion. So when this happens, there is a chance that the last wave of the impulse, Wave 5, will not reach the end of Wave 3 before the market starts correcting in the opposite direction. At this point, the market is just too exhausted. This condition is often called a “failure” or a “Truncation.”

I can see many people still believe that we are going inside a  descending triangle . I also believed this in my idea that i shard on may 1st: 



 

Things can change so quickly and if we didn't adapt to the changes then someone will. That's why i believe that we have to be in fast adapt mode in this market. Doesn't mean that you need to change without checking yourself. I try to find 2-3 confirmations before i change my idea on something. This includes pattern changes, trend changes etc 

There are 21 corrective wave patterns in EW which is categorized into major 3 corrective wave patterns: 

Zigzag  (5-3-5) 
Flat (3-3-5) 
Triangle (3-3-3-3-3) 

And other patterns are combinations of the above which is:  

Double three (A combination of two corrective patterns above) 
Triple three (A combination of three corrective patterns above) 

So what i can see now is that we are in two double three combination corrective wave pattern: 








More info here:  

https://elliottwave-forecast.com/elliott-wave-theory/#corrective-waves 

Confirmations: 

1. Wave ((i)) of C is 1.6k and ((v)) is going to be completed below the triangle 
2. Wave (E) of the triangle can't go beyond the triangle.  
3. This has happened twice before in 2013 & 2015 

Each wave  got 3 subwaves (a,b &c) inside and we are in the subwave c of ((y)) of Y which is an impulsive wave. 

Impulsive waves: 1,3,5,a,c 
Corrective waves: 2,4,b 

Normal Fibo Ratios for these waves are: 

wave 2 = 0.5 - 0.8 of wave 1  
wave 3 = 1.236 - 1.618 of wave 1  
wave 4 = 0.5 - 0.618 of wave 3  
wave 5 = 0.618 - 1 of wave 1  
wave B = 0.5 - 0.8 of wave A  
wave C = 0.618 - 1.236 of wave A  

Now if you check what happened in subwave a of ((y)) of Y you can see that: 

Wave (i) of a: 985$ 
Wave (ii) of a: 434$  
Wave ( iii 0.12% ) of a: 1207$  
Wave (iv) of a: 691$ [~0.618 of Wave ( iii 0.12% )] 
Wave (v) of a: 950$  








I have seen  BTC -1.14%  impulsive waves fibo ratios almost the same as the previous impulsive wave fibo ratios. 
Now if you apply the same for the last wave C of (E) this is what you get: 

Wave ((i)) of c: 1587$ 
Wave ((ii)) of c  = 793$ 
Wave (( iii 0.12% )) of c  = 1961$ 
Wave ((iv)) of c [~0.618 of Wave (( iii 0.12% ))] = 1212$ 
Wave ((v)) of c  = 1587$ 








Also note that Wave ((iv)) might not retrace upto 0.618 of Wave (( iii 0.12% )) as everyone will be in panic mode by that time so minimum retracement would be around 0.386 of Wave (( iii 0.12% )) which is around 756$ and this is why i can see it goes down to 5k level or little bit more towards 4.7k which is the lowest level of the  support zone  (orange dotted lines) 








So 3 Possible Support lines for reversal would be 

1. Blue: 5800 - 6100 (Only possible if Wave ((v)) is truncated) 
2. Orange: 4700 - 5000 (This is most likely where we heading)  
3. Red: 4100 - 4400 (Only possible if Wave (( iii 0.12% )) is extended)

 Bitcoin -1.14%  has recently developed an interesting pattern of completing a  bullish  and  bearish  cycle on the sixth of every month in an alternating order. As we can see in the chart above, a fall is followed by a rise. This has happened twice before and is expected to happen again now on the  6th 0.00%  of June, 2018. This time  Bitcoin -1.14%  will finish a  bearish  cycle and I expected to begin the next  bullish  cycle at least till the end of  6th 0.00%  of July, 2018. 

This pattern of rise and fall is also supported by other patterns on the chart that signal a  bullish  reversal. The support line has also held firmly and if this pattern of alternating rise and fall ensues,  Bitcoin -1.14%  could very well make new highs by the end of the year. The  RSI  is recovering from oversold levels and has now approached a normal.  Bitcoin -1.14%  is currently at a favorable point for  bullish  entries. The price broke a long term resistance as it break past the downtrend line in April, 2018. This was a big accomplishment for the bulls but the lack of confidence pulled the price back to the support line. Currently, the price is just above the support line and appears to be all set for a  bullish  comeback but the reality is, there are not enough bulls in the market. 

The past few months have been devastating for the price of  Bitcoin -1.14%  ( BTC -1.14% ) and a lot of investors are still running scared. Institutional investors are looking for more clarity regarding regulations concerning cryptocurrencies and also safer ways to invest and store their coins. As for retail investors, most of them comprise of first time investors who have never traded any financial asset before. So, when they saw that  Bitcoin -1.14%  ( BTC -1.14% ) is making 20% gains every day, they thought this could go on forever and jumped with both feet, only to find the carpet pulled under from their feet. Big investors have always played small investors as cannon fodder and have gotten away with their schemes even in regulated markets like forex or the stock market. Cryptocurrencies is a new market with no proper regulations which means it is natural to expect that those who can afford to not play by the rules, most likely won’t.

Hello friends,  

It's been a while since my last post; lack of time and an urge to do more research has mainly driven me to take a break from posting ideas on TradingView. I am still in the process of doing more research and study, but I figure posting once in a while couldn't hurt. 

Since I have become recently very convinced about this, I am outlining a very possible situation with  Bitcoin -1.24%  where the  trend line  we have been on since early October breaks, reaching around a temporary low of $5000. This is examined on the  daily chart , since this is one of the best charts to examine trends of this size. I have to first and foremost say that I am not trying to spread fear, I know many people do not like to hear  bearish  ideas, but  technical analysis  is ultimately a rational exercise, and I feel that possibilities with very strong signs should be explored. 

There are a few things to look at, but I first want to talk about the big picture with, long-term  support and resistance  lines. I think most people can agree that there was a very significant downtrending resistance line that began from the peak of the  ATH 0.63%  in late December, to the low of around $6400 (thick red line). After the break from that line, it seems we moved into a sideways trend, bouncing back and forth between an emerging downtrending resistance line (light red) and a support line that we seem to have been respecting since mid-October (light green); at least this appears to be the case with the lows, where the angle's effectiveness appears very strongly. Finally, based on previous bounces, we can establish a support of around $5000-$5300 (I've thus created a small  support zone  around that range, in dark green), as well as lower supports around $3200 and $2000 (though I do not believe these will be reached, in dark green).   

Now, onto the analysis - it's no secret that  Bitcoin -1.24%  has been squeezing in, ready for a significant move either upwards or downwards. Initially I considered the upwards move to be more likely due to the significant media attention cryptocurrency has been receiving, but after viewing previous market cycles of  Bitcoin -1.24%  (check 2013), it seems clear to me that the  bearish  scenario of closing in on the market cycle is very likely, and should at the very least be prepared for with proper risk management. According to Dow Theory, which is said to have laid the foundations of modern  technical analysis , history repeats itself, and this is a situation where we forced to consider this. 

Should we break from the line, we will likely fall straight down to the $5000-$5000 area, where we will shoot back up and bounce towards around $6700 or so (maybe a little less). From there one, we will likely enter a sideways trend, which we will continue until we see higher highs and higher lows and parabolic movement returns, which could lead to us challenging the all-time high, and hitting $35k-$50k. 

NOTE: I seem to have reached the max character limit for this section of the idea, so I will continue my text below.

Comment:
					Onto the short-term: 


Scenario A: 

The reason why I have drawn this movement into a pennant is this way, is simply because we have been moving through this ascending triangle for quite a while now (May 23rd to today). I don't think that the pattern will be sufficient to directly lead into a strong sell-off, but we should consider that the size of ascending triangle suggests a small movement downwards at the very least, which can create a higher low, and thus move into position into a bearish pennant. Why would a bearish pennant occur here and not have a bounce to $8500-$8700? The reason is in positioning - the huge downtrend (May 5th to May 26th) creates a very nice flagpole in which it hits around the $5000 area very perfectly, and thus I would not be surprised if this happens. 

Second reason: on the Stoch RSI indicator on the daily chart, it appears to be dangerously high, which would suggest it being oversold. For the most part, it seems to have called lows and highs, at least to some extent. This overdrawn movement may very well have increased the likelyhood of Bitcoin being oversold. This could suggest that this is the last step into a sharp downturn, but this does not preclude Situation B. Volume has also been steadily decreasing, but this is the case with any sort of consolidation, I believe. 

Finally, the lines I have drawn below the triangle are simply bounces that I think seem fairly reasonable. The length from to support to the lines correlate with the length of the flagpole, of course, though it may seem chopped off due to the huge line from the long-term support downwards. 


Scenario B: 

This is much simpler, Bitcoin hits the upper resistance line, bounces off, challenges the lower support line, and we potentially see a break, and the rest unfolds from there. 


----------------------------------------------------------------------- 


With all this being said, do not fear if you are hoping for more parabolic movement - this likely will not be the end, and will simply be the set up for a long, drawn out sideways movement until the first signs of bullish activity begin and we start all over again. If you are longing around here, please consider using risk management, prepare for every possibility. If you are shorting, the same applies. 

Please trade with care. I wish the best to all traders!

Comment:
					This really is a very minor note, but I just want to emphasize that the rising wedge (which I erroneously refer to as an ascending triangle, a bad habit I have) entering a bearish pennant is more based on intuition than anything. Also, this pennant is mainly based on the conservative assumption that the break will happen at 7900, if it happens at 7700 where we seem to be general resistance, the pennant would look something like this:

I am Mid term-bullish on  BTC -1.25%  going into the end of this week, but looking to get into the market on a pull back to occur before I get in to the market.  The jury is still out as to whether this weekly bear trend is ready to turn around.  

We can see that both the  RSI  and  MFI  are both  Bullish  on the daily having bottomed when reaching oversold on both at c. $7k support where we found our longer term  trend line . 

We are currently in the process of meeting the Tenkan (blue line) as I write this, so in the very short term, I am looking for a pull back to $7550 range for an entry.  One of the main reasons for this is that on the 4hour timeframes we are close to completing an edge to edge trade so the risk reward doesn’t fit my profile, however a break out from the cloud or above the Tenkan around $7777 will make me enter the market. 

The  RSI  and  MFI  have both been excellent indicators in this bear market.  Whenever  RSI  has gone above the 60 and the  MFI  80; its time to exit the market from a  bullish  trade and consider shorting as it progresses higher.   

Based on the  RSI ,  MFI  trends and the fact that we will run into the Kijun at just around $8-8.2k, I will be scalling out at this  bearish  confluence level to start looking for pull backs and reassessment as i believe it to be a key point as  

Best case scenario this trade would yield a 10% return before leverage. 
This is for illustrative purposes only, please DYOR and goodluck with your trading.

So the pullback trade that we were looking at worked out & has made it's way back to the neckline level of structure. We are now at what i like to call a ""decision point"" Essentially IF price is able to violate this current level od structure THEN we're likely to continue to our next price projection.  

Something that a lot of newer traders don't understand is that when it comes to bigger moves, the market will often provide multiple opportunities to get involved. For those who don't rush and for those who don't get discouraged. If you perform consistent analysis you can often find multiple ways to involve yourself in a trade even if you missed the first strike.

This is the way markets move, If you question my charting check my previous posts. Its as simple as pie. We are going down, How long and how far is too soon to say. Here is a chart that we can understand the future price action and where to buy back. Before you guys start blasting my comment section with the time and how it may not be right thats correct. I am not calculating the time I'm just making a technical drawing of the directions that we will see in the next few months.  

Recent price action has clear signs of wash trading / market manipulation fud and lots of nonsense. Its hard to prove almost impossible so as a trader we just need to deal with it. Ideally the situation you are supposed to trade are critical break up and break down points to enter the trade. Dont enter or exit dumb trades and lose money. As an experienced trader you should be looking for shorts, I would not consider a long unless we are over $10-12k

I am never good with words so instead of writing paragraphs of clarification to justify my call for SHORT since my last posting, I have explained everything on my chart with the least words possible using Fibonacci. It does not matter how popular  Bitcoin -1.28%  has become, or how deep it has disrupted the financial sector, or how many institutional investors have come to invest in it -- the psychology behind a market cycle does not change. 

I don't really encourage anyone to short  Bitcoin -1.28% , but in all honesty, don't expect the bulls to fly anytime soon. Like I said before, this correction that we are having right now is the ""MOTHER OF ALL CORRECTIONS"" after a 4-year-long bull cycle since the 2013 correction... and we are just halfway through.

My best idea ever, taking some time off the last 2 days :) The whales just continue to play their little games by squeezing leveraged short and long positions out of the market. Can't play them, it's just too easy. Maybe it's time we retail traders stand together, combine our  volume  and use their own game against them. Yeah, maybe we could even make a blockbuster movie about this :) I love me some science fiction :) LOL  

My last update of the previous analysis i showed 2 important support levels where the price could bounce up from. The first support around 7350 did the trick and the price got pushed back to 7700. From that point on i told my members that i thought i was seeing distribution, but it was still very confusing to figure out what was going on. TA was showing  bullish  signs, that  bull flag  was very strong and was even turning slowly up and was about to squeeze upwards. But of course out of no where the price got dumped, the move we saw a few hours ago. After that 200 point drop the price got pushed up again to 7700 like that dump was a glitch. If your a whale, why not push out leveraged traders and take your money while your accumulating or distributing. It's like a bonus, like the cherry on top :)  

Anyway, in this chart we can see allot of similarities of what is going on. As you know i have been saying i am still  bearish  for the medium term, but i just could not say what was going to happen on the short term. 2 days ago after we finally dropped out of that  wedge , i said we would have 2 options.  
- Break those 2 support levels from the last update of my previous chart (73xx and 71xx) 
- Make a higher low at those same support levels and make another move up above the high.  
 
As we can see in the chart, the  fractal  is not 100% identical so it's no guarantee that the 7700 high we just saw is the high already and that we start to move down. But based on this  fractal , i don't want to see the price get above the 7800/7900. This  fractal  confirms my  bearish  view as well. That's why TA is so great, you can turn any chart to fit your view :). 

Even without this  fractal , i just give it a very small chance that 7K price action is the fundament of a low to start another bull rally, i just highly doubt that. I want to see more  volume  to begin with and at least  double bottom  kind of formation. So the minimum i expect is a test of the 7100/6900in the coming week or 2. But the movement i have in mind for the med term is a drop below the 7K to form a big V shape low. If we get to see that, than i might even become  bullish  for the rest of the year :).  

As long as the price stays above the 73xx, we have to assume the bulls are still in control and we should see another wave up. So for me the 73xx is an important turning point.

					At the moment it looks like bulls are trying to push higher, this bull flag/triangle is still very strong. So no sign of weakness yet! First small sign would be a drop below 7620/7600. Bulls need to break 7700

Comment:
					This is my bigger picture, think this bearish triangle is still 100% in play. I think if bulls can't break the 7800/7900 the bearish version is probably going to happen. Can't say HOW it will go, this blue line is just a guess. But a big V shape low would be the most bullish for the long term. I still think we are seeing distribution here. The only way this idea can be countered, is through a big increase of buying volume, if that doesn't happen, i think it's only a matter of time.

The price took a small dump but the volume was low so no real read on what the intent was. So we might see another move up, if we start to see a small pump that takes out the 7800, be aware of a fake breakout. The blue line is a possibility of what the move could look like IF we move up and if the breakout fails. If that happens than we will probably get confirmation if the price breaks the 7600ish. If we break the 7800 it should stay above the 7700 to confirm another move up. Not much more to say about what's going on.

289,1528359434.0,Taiwan_Bear,2618 (Double top & 0.618 pull-back) - do not miss it!!,"
In the last couple of TAs I have mentioned the “2618 pattern” and have been asked what 2618 means. Sorry for taking it so long as it took me quite a while to put everything altogether. But, as promised, I have explained below the rules and trade setups for the 2618 pattern.  

What are the rules/setups/steps for 2618?  
1.	Form a  double top  (Note #1)  
2.	Neckline has to be broken  
3.	After price found support at point (b), wait for pull back to 0.618 fib retracement of (a)(b)  
4.	After price retraced to 0.618, look for confluence and sell (eg. Structures,  trendlines  ,  double top  on a lower time frame,  rsi  divergence,  bearish pin bar  ,  inside bar  break down etc.) (Note #2)  
5.	Stop loss to be set above  double top 
6.	Set Take Profit levels (Note #3)  

Note #1 ( Double top ):  
The first step for the formation of 2618 is to form a  double top  at key resistance levels. Why at key resistance levels? Because we want to avoid fake double tops which can occur occasionally.  

There are some variations between various resources (books, websites) regarding the definitions of “double top”. The main differences occur where:  
a)	Some said for a  double top  to be valid, the wick of the 2nd top cannot exceed the wick of the 1st top; whereas, others said:  
b)	The wick of the 2nd top can exceed the wick of the 1st top but the candle close of the 2nd top CANNOT exceed the wick of the 1st top; or  
c)	The wick of the 2nd top can exceed the wick of the 1st top and the candle close of the 2nd top CAN exceed the wick of the 1st top; or  
d)	The wick of the 2nd top meets at least the candle close of the 1st top; or  
e)	The body of the 2nd top cannot exceed the body of the 1st top  

Personally, I would say all the above definitions work just fine although I do prefer definition a) because it means that the selling pressure is strong and the bulls fail to make a higher high. When there is a higher high formed in a downtrend, it can mean the downtrend has reversed and therefore you might not want to sell when the price pulls back to the 0.618 fib retracement.  

Note #2 ( 0.618 retracement ):  
When the price pulls back to 0.618, it does not mean to sell straight away. There must be more than one reason to sell other than the 0.618 retrace. The more reasons the better. In this example, you can see there are certainly structures (key resistance levels) at the 0.618 retrace. As well, there was a  double top  formed on the lower time frame. Consequently, you can sell.  

After  BTC -1.37%  hit the 0.618 retrace the first time, the price dropped from $9735 to $8650. but quickly bounced back to the 0.618 retrace level. That was a second & better opportunity to sell. Not only did  BTC -1.37%  form a  double top  on the larger time frame, but also with a  bearish  divergence on the 4hr time frame. Accordingly, you have more reasons to sell.  

Note #3 (Set take profit)  
Same as the rules of “Double top”, there are some variations as to which price level should you take profits. Personally, I would stick to the below:  
1)	First, take profit when risk/reward ratio hits 1:1 (recommend to take 30% - 50% profits and adjust the SL of the remaining positions to break-even)  
2)	When price hits the same price level as the low after the neckline is broken ((b) point in this example)  
3)	When price hits 1.272 fib extension of (a)(b)  
4)	When price hits point (d) (using  AB=CD  pattern. If you are not sure what the rules of  AB=CD  are, you can refer to my previous TA in which I have attached the link below)  
5)	If in a one-way market (heavily bearish/bullish), you can always keep 10% to 20% of your positions and take profits when risk/reward ratio hits 1:5 or even 1:10

 BTC -1.37%  is on the verge of breaking to a daily higher high on the bounce if the bulls can see a push this morning. 
If we reject from here the daily will form a lower high and we will see a tightening pattern within the highlighted  support and resistance  lines.  
Important for the bulls to show up or we could stay in this range into tomorrow.  
Healthy consolidation after the most recent bull move and the 15 min chart needs to change the trend.  
Also look to  EMA  12 support on the 4 hour and hourly.  
Another morning like yesterday with the bulls comfortable as worst case, we likely stay in the tightening pattern if bulls cannot prove themselves.

The current situation of  Bitcoin -1.38%  is quite difficult. We are on a clear treshold. A lot of traders are saying that we are on a clear downtrend, but the same amount of people are claiming that we will have our reversal soon. 

This article tries to sum up all important information you have to need! 

1: Retracement of a parabolic uptrend: 
There is a rule of thumb for the retracement of a parabolic uptrend. We should retrace to approx. the 0.786  Fibonacci Retracement  +/- 10%! 
Depending where we start the count, we are already in that target. Although both ways (blue and red) have still some space for a further downwave! 







2: The bloody support of Bitcoin: 
The average cost of mining one  bitcoin -1.38%  are at USA/Russia approx. 4700$ and at 3100$ for china! 
A drop below a target of 4700$ would be savage. Nevertheless, i can't image that we will hit that target. 







3: Manipulation of  Bitcoin -1.38%  and the Bart Simpson Pattern: 
A friend of mine found some unusual patterns in the orderbooks of several exchanges: 
https://twitter.com/CryptoSyndrome 
Altcoins are manipulated on a daily basis. It seems that  bitcoin -1.38%  is now affected to this too, which causes all these 3-5% pump and dumps. 
Thus, we are forming all the time the Bartin Simpsons Patterns. 

4: Similarity to 2014: 
Bitcoin -1.38%  now: 






Bitcoin -1.38%  2014: 







5: Deminishing downtrend and a strong support 
If we see the falling  wedges  as the force of the downtrend, then the force is diminishing! 
Furthermore we have strong support which is holding now for the 4th time! 







6: The Indicators 
Having a look at the indicators at 2D, we have a good potential for an upwave now. 
The  volume  is deminishing which should indicate a breakout soon. 
The  MACD  is about to cross, the  RSI  was slightly overbought and is heading up like the  Stoch .  RSI . 
The 200  EMA  is slighty under the current price and act as a support. 

7: The symetrical Triangle 
The theory says, that we should have in a  sym -0.80% . triangle 5 times an  ABC  wave. The waves are not perfect, but we can construct them. 






As you can see, the last four ABC-Waves formed always a 1:1 extention, which indicates that we have finished wave 5. 

8: A possible Head and Shoulders 
Even if this is not the most perfect  Head and Shoulders  Pattern, it's still valid! 
We are currently at the neckline, which is a strong and important resistance. Breaking upwards should indicate a good uptrend. 







9: The magic  6th 0.00%  of the month 






Suprisingly we have on every  6th 0.00%  of the month a reversal. Why is that??? 
One reason could be the  CME Group Futures  with dates for the settlements always nearby the  6th 0.00%  of the month! 
http://www.cmegroup.com 

10: Longterm  Bullish  TA 
The whole pattern could be seen as a big  bullish pennant . 







11: Shortterm  Bullish  TA 
Leading diagonal  starting wave1 of an  Elliott Wave , since we have now an impulse wave, after the 5x  ABC  pattern inside the triangle is finished. 
Our target should be at the top of the triangle nearby 8600-8800$. 







12: Longterm  Bearish  TA 
We also can argue, that we are currenty in an downtrend and the  sym -0.80% . triangle just continuing the trend. 
Our target should be nearby 6000$ which is also a finished downwards  Elliott Wave .

Nothing is happening in the market:  volatility  has become extinct and coins' trading fallen out of fashion. Range-bound bots and robotic humans absolutely prosper in this environment. The price was unable to break the 7700 threshold. For me this is a  bearish  signal. Indicators provide mixed signals, so let's examine wave structure. The move from May 29 is a  3-wave -0.12%  correction within a larger downtrend. A price drop below 7500 would confirm this scenario.

					Impulse Wave Truncation (Truncated Fifth) - 
Truncated 5th wave is when the market has become so over-extended in Wave 3 that there is not much force left for the impulse wave to come to a proper completion. So when this happens, there is a chance that the last wave of the impulse, Wave 5, will not reach the end of Wave 3 before the market starts correcting in the opposite direction.

I can see many people still believe that we are going inside a  descending triangle . I also believed this in my idea that i shard on may 1st: 



 

Things can change so quickly and if we didn't adapt to the changes then someone will. That's why i believe that we have to be in fast adapt mode in this market. Doesn't mean that you need to change without checking yourself. I try to find 2-3 confirmations before i change my idea on something. This includes pattern changes, trend changes etc 

There are 21 corrective wave patterns in EW which is categorized into major 3 corrective wave patterns: 

Zigzag  (5-3-5) 
Flat (3-3-5) 
Triangle (3-3-3-3-3) 

And other patterns are combinations of the above which is:  

Double three (A combination of two corrective patterns above) 
Triple three (A combination of three corrective patterns above) 

So what i can see now is that we are in two double three combination corrective wave pattern: 








More info here:  

https://elliottwave-forecast.com/elliott-wave-theory/#corrective-waves 

Confirmations: 

1. Wave ((i)) of C is 1.6k and ((v)) is going to be completed below the triangle 
2. Wave (E) of the triangle can't go beyond the triangle.  
3. This has happened twice before in 2013 & 2015 

Each wave  got 3 subwaves (a,b &c) inside and we are in the subwave c of ((y)) of Y which is an impulsive wave. 

Impulsive waves: 1,3,5,a,c 
Corrective waves: 2,4,b 

Normal Fibo Ratios for these waves are: 

wave 2 = 0.5 - 0.8 of wave 1  
wave 3 = 1.236 - 1.618 of wave 1  
wave 4 = 0.5 - 0.618 of wave 3  
wave 5 = 0.618 - 1 of wave 1  
wave B = 0.5 - 0.8 of wave A  
wave C = 0.618 - 1.236 of wave A  

Now if you check what happened in subwave a of ((y)) of Y you can see that: 

Wave (i) of a: 985$ 
Wave (ii) of a: 434$  
Wave ( iii -0.52% ) of a: 1207$  
Wave (iv) of a: 691$ [~0.618 of Wave ( iii -0.52% )] 
Wave (v) of a: 950$  








I have seen  BTC -1.39%  impulsive waves fibo ratios almost the same as the previous impulsive wave fibo ratios. 
Now if you apply the same for the last wave C of (E) this is what you get: 

Wave ((i)) of c: 1587$ 
Wave ((ii)) of c  = 793$ 
Wave (( iii -0.52% )) of c  = 1961$ 
Wave ((iv)) of c [~0.618 of Wave (( iii -0.52% ))] = 1212$ 
Wave ((v)) of c  = 1587$ 








Also note that Wave ((iv)) might not retrace upto 0.618 of Wave (( iii -0.52% )) as everyone will be in panic mode by that time so minimum retracement would be around 0.386 of Wave (( iii -0.52% )) which is around 756$ and this is why i can see it goes down to 5k level or little bit more towards 4.7k which is the lowest level of the  support zone  (orange dotted lines) 








So 3 Possible Support lines for reversal would be 

1. Blue: 5800 - 6100 (Only possible if Wave ((v)) is truncated) 
2. Orange: 4700 - 5000 (This is most likely where we heading)  
3. Red: 4100 - 4400 (Only possible if Wave (( iii -0.52% )) is extended)

 Bitcoin -1.39%  has recently developed an interesting pattern of completing a  bullish  and  bearish  cycle on the sixth of every month in an alternating order. As we can see in the chart above, a fall is followed by a rise. This has happened twice before and is expected to happen again now on the  6th 0.00%  of June, 2018. This time  Bitcoin -1.39%  will finish a  bearish  cycle and I expected to begin the next  bullish  cycle at least till the end of  6th 0.00%  of July, 2018. 

This pattern of rise and fall is also supported by other patterns on the chart that signal a  bullish  reversal. The support line has also held firmly and if this pattern of alternating rise and fall ensues,  Bitcoin -1.39%  could very well make new highs by the end of the year. The  RSI  is recovering from oversold levels and has now approached a normal.  Bitcoin -1.39%  is currently at a favorable point for  bullish  entries. The price broke a long term resistance as it break past the downtrend line in April, 2018. This was a big accomplishment for the bulls but the lack of confidence pulled the price back to the support line. Currently, the price is just above the support line and appears to be all set for a  bullish  comeback but the reality is, there are not enough bulls in the market. 

The past few months have been devastating for the price of  Bitcoin -1.39%  ( BTC -1.39% ) and a lot of investors are still running scared. Institutional investors are looking for more clarity regarding regulations concerning cryptocurrencies and also safer ways to invest and store their coins. As for retail investors, most of them comprise of first time investors who have never traded any financial asset before. So, when they saw that  Bitcoin -1.39%  ( BTC -1.39% ) is making 20% gains every day, they thought this could go on forever and jumped with both feet, only to find the carpet pulled under from their feet. Big investors have always played small investors as cannon fodder and have gotten away with their schemes even in regulated markets like forex or the stock market. Cryptocurrencies is a new market with no proper regulations which means it is natural to expect that those who can afford to not play by the rules, most likely won’t.

Hello friends,  

It's been a while since my last post; lack of time and an urge to do more research has mainly driven me to take a break from posting ideas on TradingView. I am still in the process of doing more research and study, but I figure posting once in a while couldn't hurt. 

Since I have become recently very convinced about this, I am outlining a very possible situation with  Bitcoin -1.40%  where the  trend line  we have been on since early October breaks, reaching around a temporary low of $5000. This is examined on the  daily chart , since this is one of the best charts to examine trends of this size. I have to first and foremost say that I am not trying to spread fear, I know many people do not like to hear  bearish  ideas, but  technical analysis  is ultimately a rational exercise, and I feel that possibilities with very strong signs should be explored. 

There are a few things to look at, but I first want to talk about the big picture with, long-term  support and resistance  lines. I think most people can agree that there was a very significant downtrending resistance line that began from the peak of the  ATH 0.63%  in late December, to the low of around $6400 (thick red line). After the break from that line, it seems we moved into a sideways trend, bouncing back and forth between an emerging downtrending resistance line (light red) and a support line that we seem to have been respecting since mid-October (light green); at least this appears to be the case with the lows, where the angle's effectiveness appears very strongly. Finally, based on previous bounces, we can establish a support of around $5000-$5300 (I've thus created a small  support zone  around that range, in dark green), as well as lower supports around $3200 and $2000 (though I do not believe these will be reached, in dark green).   

Now, onto the analysis - it's no secret that  Bitcoin -1.40%  has been squeezing in, ready for a significant move either upwards or downwards. Initially I considered the upwards move to be more likely due to the significant media attention cryptocurrency has been receiving, but after viewing previous market cycles of  Bitcoin -1.40%  (check 2013), it seems clear to me that the  bearish  scenario of closing in on the market cycle is very likely, and should at the very least be prepared for with proper risk management. According to Dow Theory, which is said to have laid the foundations of modern  technical analysis , history repeats itself, and this is a situation where we forced to consider this. 

Should we break from the line, we will likely fall straight down to the $5000-$5000 area, where we will shoot back up and bounce towards around $6700 or so (maybe a little less). From there one, we will likely enter a sideways trend, which we will continue until we see higher highs and higher lows and parabolic movement returns, which could lead to us challenging the all-time high, and hitting $35k-$50k. 

NOTE: I seem to have reached the max character limit for this section of the idea, so I will continue my text below.

Comment:
					Onto the short-term: 


Scenario A: 

The reason why I have drawn this movement into a pennant is this way, is simply because we have been moving through this ascending triangle for quite a while now (May 23rd to today). I don't think that the pattern will be sufficient to directly lead into a strong sell-off, but we should consider that the size of ascending triangle suggests a small movement downwards at the very least, which can create a higher low, and thus move into position into a bearish pennant. Why would a bearish pennant occur here and not have a bounce to $8500-$8700? The reason is in positioning - the huge downtrend (May 5th to May 26th) creates a very nice flagpole in which it hits around the $5000 area very perfectly, and thus I would not be surprised if this happens. 

Second reason: on the Stoch RSI indicator on the daily chart, it appears to be dangerously high, which would suggest it being oversold. For the most part, it seems to have called lows and highs, at least to some extent. This overdrawn movement may very well have increased the likelyhood of Bitcoin being oversold. This could suggest that this is the last step into a sharp downturn, but this does not preclude Situation B. Volume has also been steadily decreasing, but this is the case with any sort of consolidation, I believe. 

Finally, the lines I have drawn below the triangle are simply bounces that I think seem fairly reasonable. The length from to support to the lines correlate with the length of the flagpole, of course, though it may seem chopped off due to the huge line from the long-term support downwards. 


Scenario B: 

This is much simpler, Bitcoin hits the upper resistance line, bounces off, challenges the lower support line, and we potentially see a break, and the rest unfolds from there. 


----------------------------------------------------------------------- 


With all this being said, do not fear if you are hoping for more parabolic movement - this likely will not be the end, and will simply be the set up for a long, drawn out sideways movement until the first signs of bullish activity begin and we start all over again. If you are longing around here, please consider using risk management, prepare for every possibility. If you are shorting, the same applies. 

Please trade with care. I wish the best to all traders!

Comment:
					This really is a very minor note, but I just want to emphasize that the rising wedge (which I erroneously refer to as an ascending triangle, a bad habit I have) entering a bearish pennant is more based on intuition than anything. Also, this pennant is mainly based on the conservative assumption that the break will happen at 7900, if it happens at 7700 where we seem to be general resistance, the pennant would look something like this:

Jun 7




I am Mid term-bullish on  BTC -1.40%  going into the end of this week, but looking to get into the market on a pull back to occur before I get in to the market.  The jury is still out as to whether this weekly bear trend is ready to turn around.  

We can see that both the  RSI  and  MFI  are both  Bullish  on the daily having bottomed when reaching oversold on both at c. $7k support where we found our longer term  trend line . 

We are currently in the process of meeting the Tenkan (blue line) as I write this, so in the very short term, I am looking for a pull back to $7550 range for an entry.  One of the main reasons for this is that on the 4hour timeframes we are close to completing an edge to edge trade so the risk reward doesn’t fit my profile, however a break out from the cloud or above the Tenkan around $7777 will make me enter the market. 

The  RSI  and  MFI  have both been excellent indicators in this bear market.  Whenever  RSI  has gone above the 60 and the  MFI  80; its time to exit the market from a  bullish  trade and consider shorting as it progresses higher.   

Based on the  RSI ,  MFI  trends and the fact that we will run into the Kijun at just around $8-8.2k, I will be scalling out at this  bearish  confluence level to start looking for pull backs and reassessment as i believe it to be a key point as  

Best case scenario this trade would yield a 10% return before leverage. 
This is for illustrative purposes only, please DYOR and goodluck with your trading.

So the pullback trade that we were looking at worked out & has made it's way back to the neckline level of structure. We are now at what i like to call a ""decision point"" Essentially IF price is able to violate this current level od structure THEN we're likely to continue to our next price projection.  

Something that a lot of newer traders don't understand is that when it comes to bigger moves, the market will often provide multiple opportunities to get involved. For those who don't rush and for those who don't get discouraged. If you perform consistent analysis you can often find multiple ways to involve yourself in a trade even if you missed the first strike.

Recent price action has clear signs of wash trading / market manipulation fud and lots of nonsense. Its hard to prove almost impossible so as a trader we just need to deal with it. Ideally the situation you are supposed to trade are critical break up and break down points to enter the trade. Dont enter or exit dumb trades and lose money.

I am never good with words so instead of writing paragraphs of clarification to justify my call for SHORT since my last posting, I have explained everything on my chart with the least words possible using Fibonacci. It does not matter how popular  Bitcoin -1.40%  has become, or how deep it has disrupted the financial sector, or how many institutional investors have come to invest in it -- the psychology behind a market cycle does not change. 

I don't really encourage anyone to short  Bitcoin -1.40% , but in all honesty, don't expect the bulls to fly anytime soon.

My best idea ever, taking some time off the last 2 days :) The whales just continue to play their little games by squeezing leveraged short and long positions out of the market. Can't play them, it's just too easy. Maybe it's time we retail traders stand together, combine our  volume  and use their own game against them. Yeah, maybe we could even make a blockbuster movie about this :) I love me some science fiction :) LOL  

My last update of the previous analysis i showed 2 important support levels where the price could bounce up from. The first support around 7350 did the trick and the price got pushed back to 7700. From that point on i told my members that i thought i was seeing distribution, but it was still very confusing to figure out what was going on. TA was showing  bullish  signs, that  bull flag  was very strong and was even turning slowly up and was about to squeeze upwards. But of course out of no where the price got dumped, the move we saw a few hours ago. After that 200 point drop the price got pushed up again to 7700 like that dump was a glitch. If your a whale, why not push out leveraged traders and take your money while your accumulating or distributing. It's like a bonus, like the cherry on top :)  

Anyway, in this chart we can see allot of similarities of what is going on. As you know i have been saying i am still  bearish  for the medium term, but i just could not say what was going to happen on the short term. 2 days ago after we finally dropped out of that  wedge , i said we would have 2 options.  
- Break those 2 support levels from the last update of my previous chart (73xx and 71xx) 
- Make a higher low at those same support levels and make another move up above the high.  
 
As we can see in the chart, the  fractal  is not 100% identical so it's no guarantee that the 7700 high we just saw is the high already and that we start to move down. But based on this  fractal , i don't want to see the price get above the 7800/7900. This  fractal  confirms my  bearish  view as well. That's why TA is so great, you can turn any chart to fit your view :). 

Even without this  fractal , i just give it a very small chance that 7K price action is the fundament of a low to start another bull rally, i just highly doubt that. I want to see more  volume  to begin with and at least  double bottom  kind of formation. So the minimum i expect is a test of the 7100/6900in the coming week or 2. But the movement i have in mind for the med term is a drop below the 7K to form a big V shape low. If we get to see that, than i might even become  bullish  for the rest of the year :).  

As long as the price stays above the 73xx, we have to assume the bulls are still in control and we should see another wave up. So for me the 73xx is an important turning point.

					At the moment it looks like bulls are trying to push higher, this bull flag/triangle is still very strong. So no sign of weakness yet! First small sign would be a drop below 7620/7600. Bulls need to break 7700

					This is my bigger picture, think this bearish triangle is still 100% in play. I think if bulls can't break the 7800/7900 the bearish version is probably going to happen. Can't say HOW it will go, this blue line is just a guess. But a big V shape low would be the most bullish for the long term. I still think we are seeing distribution here. The only way this idea can be countered, is through a big increase of buying volume, if that doesn't happen, i think it's only a matter of time.

The price took a small dump but the volume was low so no real read on what the intent was. So we might see another move up, if we start to see a small pump that takes out the 7800, be aware of a fake breakout. The blue line is a possibility of what the move could look like IF we move up and if the breakout fails. If that happens than we will probably get confirmation if the price breaks the 7600ish. If we break the 7800 it should stay above the 7700 to confirm another move up. Not much more to say about what's going on.

307,1528359434.0,Taiwan_Bear,2618 (Double top & 0.618 pull-back) - do not miss it!!,"
In the last couple of TAs I have mentioned the “2618 pattern” and have been asked what 2618 means. Sorry for taking it so long as it took me quite a while to put everything altogether. But, as promised, I have explained below the rules and trade setups for the 2618 pattern.  

What are the rules/setups/steps for 2618?  
1.	Form a  double top  (Note #1)  
2.	Neckline has to be broken  
3.	After price found support at point (b), wait for pull back to 0.618 fib retracement of (a)(b)  
4.	After price retraced to 0.618, look for confluence and sell (eg. Structures,  trendlines  ,  double top  on a lower time frame,  rsi  divergence,  bearish pin bar  ,  inside bar  break down etc.) (Note #2)  
5.	Stop loss to be set above  double top 
6.	Set Take Profit levels (Note #3)  

Note #1 ( Double top ):  
The first step for the formation of 2618 is to form a  double top  at key resistance levels. Why at key resistance levels? Because we want to avoid fake double tops which can occur occasionally.  

There are some variations between various resources (books, websites) regarding the definitions of “double top”. The main differences occur where:  
a)	Some said for a  double top  to be valid, the wick of the 2nd top cannot exceed the wick of the 1st top; whereas, others said:  
b)	The wick of the 2nd top can exceed the wick of the 1st top but the candle close of the 2nd top CANNOT exceed the wick of the 1st top; or  
c)	The wick of the 2nd top can exceed the wick of the 1st top and the candle close of the 2nd top CAN exceed the wick of the 1st top; or  
d)	The wick of the 2nd top meets at least the candle close of the 1st top; or  
e)	The body of the 2nd top cannot exceed the body of the 1st top  

Personally, I would say all the above definitions work just fine although I do prefer definition a) because it means that the selling pressure is strong and the bulls fail to make a higher high. When there is a higher high formed in a downtrend, it can mean the downtrend has reversed and therefore you might not want to sell when the price pulls back to the 0.618 fib retracement.  

Note #2 ( 0.618 retracement ):  
When the price pulls back to 0.618, it does not mean to sell straight away. There must be more than one reason to sell other than the 0.618 retrace. The more reasons the better. In this example, you can see there are certainly structures (key resistance levels) at the 0.618 retrace. As well, there was a  double top  formed on the lower time frame. Consequently, you can sell.  

After  BTC -1.40%  hit the 0.618 retrace the first time, the price dropped from $9735 to $8650. but quickly bounced back to the 0.618 retrace level. That was a second & better opportunity to sell. Not only did  BTC -1.40%  form a  double top  on the larger time frame, but also with a  bearish  divergence on the 4hr time frame. Accordingly, you have more reasons to sell.  

Note #3 (Set take profit)  
Same as the rules of “Double top”, there are some variations as to which price level should you take profits. Personally, I would stick to the below:  
1)	First, take profit when risk/reward ratio hits 1:1 (recommend to take 30% - 50% profits and adjust the SL of the remaining positions to break-even)  
2)	When price hits the same price level as the low after the neckline is broken ((b) point in this example)  
3)	When price hits 1.272 fib extension of (a)(b)  
4)	When price hits point (d) (using  AB=CD  pattern. If you are not sure what the rules of  AB=CD  are, you can refer to my previous TA in which I have attached the link below)  
5)	If in a one-way market (heavily bearish/bullish), you can always keep 10% to 20% of your positions and take profits when risk/reward ratio hits 1:5 or even 1:10

 BTC -1.40%  is on the verge of breaking to a daily higher high on the bounce if the bulls can see a push this morning. 
If we reject from here the daily will form a lower high and we will see a tightening pattern within the highlighted  support and resistance  lines.  
Important for the bulls to show up or we could stay in this range into tomorrow.  
Healthy consolidation after the most recent bull move and the 15 min chart needs to change the trend.  
Also look to  EMA  12 support on the 4 hour and hourly.  
Another morning like yesterday with the bulls comfortable as worst case, we likely stay in the tightening pattern if bulls cannot prove themselves.

The current situation of  Bitcoin -1.40%  is quite difficult. We are on a clear treshold. A lot of traders are saying that we are on a clear downtrend, but the same amount of people are claiming that we will have our reversal soon. 

This article tries to sum up all important information you have to need! 

1: Retracement of a parabolic uptrend: 
There is a rule of thumb for the retracement of a parabolic uptrend. We should retrace to approx. the 0.786  Fibonacci Retracement  +/- 10%! 
Depending where we start the count, we are already in that target. Although both ways (blue and red) have still some space for a further downwave! 







2: The bloody support of Bitcoin: 
The average cost of mining one  bitcoin -1.40%  are at USA/Russia approx. 4700$ and at 3100$ for china! 
A drop below a target of 4700$ would be savage. Nevertheless, i can't image that we will hit that target. 







3: Manipulation of  Bitcoin -1.40%  and the Bart Simpson Pattern: 
A friend of mine found some unusual patterns in the orderbooks of several exchanges: 
https://twitter.com/CryptoSyndrome 
Altcoins are manipulated on a daily basis. It seems that  bitcoin -1.40%  is now affected to this too, which causes all these 3-5% pump and dumps. 
Thus, we are forming all the time the Bartin Simpsons Patterns. 

4: Similarity to 2014: 
Bitcoin -1.40%  now: 






Bitcoin -1.40%  2014: 







5: Deminishing downtrend and a strong support 
If we see the falling  wedges  as the force of the downtrend, then the force is diminishing! 
Furthermore we have strong support which is holding now for the 4th time! 







6: The Indicators 
Having a look at the indicators at 2D, we have a good potential for an upwave now. 
The  volume  is deminishing which should indicate a breakout soon. 
The  MACD  is about to cross, the  RSI  was slightly overbought and is heading up like the  Stoch .  RSI . 
The 200  EMA  is slighty under the current price and act as a support. 

7: The symetrical Triangle 
The theory says, that we should have in a  sym -0.80% . triangle 5 times an  ABC  wave. The waves are not perfect, but we can construct them. 






As you can see, the last four ABC-Waves formed always a 1:1 extention, which indicates that we have finished wave 5. 

8: A possible Head and Shoulders 
Even if this is not the most perfect  Head and Shoulders  Pattern, it's still valid! 
We are currently at the neckline, which is a strong and important resistance. Breaking upwards should indicate a good uptrend. 







9: The magic  6th 0.00%  of the month 






Suprisingly we have on every  6th 0.00%  of the month a reversal. Why is that??? 
One reason could be the  CME Group Futures  with dates for the settlements always nearby the  6th 0.00%  of the month! 
http://www.cmegroup.com 

10: Longterm  Bullish  TA 
The whole pattern could be seen as a big  bullish pennant . 







11: Shortterm  Bullish  TA 
Leading diagonal  starting wave1 of an  Elliott Wave , since we have now an impulse wave, after the 5x  ABC  pattern inside the triangle is finished. 
Our target should be at the top of the triangle nearby 8600-8800$. 







12: Longterm  Bearish  TA 
We also can argue, that we are currenty in an downtrend and the  sym -0.80% . triangle just continuing the trend. 
Our target should be nearby 6000$ which is also a finished downwards  Elliott Wave .

Nothing is happening in the market:  volatility  has become extinct and coins' trading fallen out of fashion. Range-bound bots and robotic humans absolutely prosper in this environment. The price was unable to break the 7700 threshold. For me this is a  bearish  signal. Indicators provide mixed signals, so let's examine wave structure. The move from May 29 is a  3-wave -0.12%  correction within a larger downtrend. A price drop below 7500 would confirm this scenario.

					Impulse Wave Truncation (Truncated Fifth) - 
Truncated 5th wave is when the market has become so over-extended in Wave 3 that there is not much force left for the impulse wave to come to a proper completion. So when this happens, there is a chance that the last wave of the impulse, Wave 5, will not reach the end of Wave 3 before the market starts correcting in the opposite direction. At this point, the market is just too exhausted. This condition is often called a “failure” or a “Truncation.”

I can see many people still believe that we are going inside a  descending triangle . I also believed this in my idea that i shard on may 1st: 



 

Things can change so quickly and if we didn't adapt to the changes then someone will. That's why i believe that we have to be in fast adapt mode in this market. Doesn't mean that you need to change without checking yourself. I try to find 2-3 confirmations before i change my idea on something. This includes pattern changes, trend changes etc 

There are 21 corrective wave patterns in EW which is categorized into major 3 corrective wave patterns: 

Zigzag  (5-3-5) 
Flat (3-3-5) 
Triangle (3-3-3-3-3) 

And other patterns are combinations of the above which is:  

Double three (A combination of two corrective patterns above) 
Triple three (A combination of three corrective patterns above) 

So what i can see now is that we are in two double three combination corrective wave pattern: 








More info here:  

https://elliottwave-forecast.com/elliott-wave-theory/#corrective-waves 

Confirmations: 

1. Wave ((i)) of C is 1.6k and ((v)) is going to be completed below the triangle 
2. Wave (E) of the triangle can't go beyond the triangle.  
3. This has happened twice before in 2013 & 2015 

Each wave  got 3 subwaves (a,b &c) inside and we are in the subwave c of ((y)) of Y which is an impulsive wave. 

Impulsive waves: 1,3,5,a,c 
Corrective waves: 2,4,b 

Normal Fibo Ratios for these waves are: 

wave 2 = 0.5 - 0.8 of wave 1  
wave 3 = 1.236 - 1.618 of wave 1  
wave 4 = 0.5 - 0.618 of wave 3  
wave 5 = 0.618 - 1 of wave 1  
wave B = 0.5 - 0.8 of wave A  
wave C = 0.618 - 1.236 of wave A  

Now if you check what happened in subwave a of ((y)) of Y you can see that: 

Wave (i) of a: 985$ 
Wave (ii) of a: 434$  
Wave ( iii 0.11% ) of a: 1207$  
Wave (iv) of a: 691$ [~0.618 of Wave ( iii 0.11% )] 
Wave (v) of a: 950$  








I have seen  BTC -1.40%  impulsive waves fibo ratios almost the same as the previous impulsive wave fibo ratios. 
Now if you apply the same for the last wave C of (E) this is what you get: 

Wave ((i)) of c: 1587$ 
Wave ((ii)) of c  = 793$ 
Wave (( iii 0.11% )) of c  = 1961$ 
Wave ((iv)) of c [~0.618 of Wave (( iii 0.11% ))] = 1212$ 
Wave ((v)) of c  = 1587$ 








Also note that Wave ((iv)) might not retrace upto 0.618 of Wave (( iii 0.11% )) as everyone will be in panic mode by that time so minimum retracement would be around 0.386 of Wave (( iii 0.11% )) which is around 756$ and this is why i can see it goes down to 5k level or little bit more towards 4.7k which is the lowest level of the  support zone  (orange dotted lines) 








So 3 Possible Support lines for reversal would be 

1. Blue: 5800 - 6100 (Only possible if Wave ((v)) is truncated) 
2. Orange: 4700 - 5000 (This is most likely where we heading)  
3. Red: 4100 - 4400 (Only possible if Wave (( iii 0.11% )) is extended)

 Bitcoin -1.40%  has recently developed an interesting pattern of completing a  bullish  and  bearish  cycle on the sixth of every month in an alternating order. As we can see in the chart above, a fall is followed by a rise. This has happened twice before and is expected to happen again now on the  6th 0.00%  of June, 2018. This time  Bitcoin -1.40%  will finish a  bearish  cycle and I expected to begin the next  bullish  cycle at least till the end of  6th 0.00%  of July, 2018. 

This pattern of rise and fall is also supported by other patterns on the chart that signal a  bullish  reversal. The support line has also held firmly and if this pattern of alternating rise and fall ensues,  Bitcoin -1.40%  could very well make new highs by the end of the year. The  RSI  is recovering from oversold levels and has now approached a normal.  Bitcoin -1.40%  is currently at a favorable point for  bullish  entries. The price broke a long term resistance as it break past the downtrend line in April, 2018. This was a big accomplishment for the bulls but the lack of confidence pulled the price back to the support line. Currently, the price is just above the support line and appears to be all set for a  bullish  comeback but the reality is, there are not enough bulls in the market. 

The past few months have been devastating for the price of  Bitcoin -1.40%  ( BTC -1.40% ) and a lot of investors are still running scared. Institutional investors are looking for more clarity regarding regulations concerning cryptocurrencies and also safer ways to invest and store their coins. As for retail investors, most of them comprise of first time investors who have never traded any financial asset before. So, when they saw that  Bitcoin -1.40%  ( BTC -1.40% ) is making 20% gains every day, they thought this could go on forever and jumped with both feet, only to find the carpet pulled under from their feet. Big investors have always played small investors as cannon fodder and have gotten away with their schemes even in regulated markets like forex or the stock market. Cryptocurrencies is a new market with no proper regulations which means it is natural to expect that those who can afford to not play by the rules, most likely won’t.

Hello friends,  

It's been a while since my last post; lack of time and an urge to do more research has mainly driven me to take a break from posting ideas on TradingView. I am still in the process of doing more research and study, but I figure posting once in a while couldn't hurt. 

Since I have become recently very convinced about this, I am outlining a very possible situation with  Bitcoin -1.40%  where the  trend line  we have been on since early October breaks, reaching around a temporary low of $5000. This is examined on the  daily chart , since this is one of the best charts to examine trends of this size. I have to first and foremost say that I am not trying to spread fear, I know many people do not like to hear  bearish  ideas, but  technical analysis  is ultimately a rational exercise, and I feel that possibilities with very strong signs should be explored. 

There are a few things to look at, but I first want to talk about the big picture with, long-term  support and resistance  lines. I think most people can agree that there was a very significant downtrending resistance line that began from the peak of the  ATH 0.63%  in late December, to the low of around $6400 (thick red line). After the break from that line, it seems we moved into a sideways trend, bouncing back and forth between an emerging downtrending resistance line (light red) and a support line that we seem to have been respecting since mid-October (light green); at least this appears to be the case with the lows, where the angle's effectiveness appears very strongly. Finally, based on previous bounces, we can establish a support of around $5000-$5300 (I've thus created a small  support zone  around that range, in dark green), as well as lower supports around $3200 and $2000 (though I do not believe these will be reached, in dark green).   

Now, onto the analysis - it's no secret that  Bitcoin -1.40%  has been squeezing in, ready for a significant move either upwards or downwards. Initially I considered the upwards move to be more likely due to the significant media attention cryptocurrency has been receiving, but after viewing previous market cycles of  Bitcoin -1.40%  (check 2013), it seems clear to me that the  bearish  scenario of closing in on the market cycle is very likely, and should at the very least be prepared for with proper risk management. According to Dow Theory, which is said to have laid the foundations of modern  technical analysis , history repeats itself, and this is a situation where we forced to consider this. 

Should we break from the line, we will likely fall straight down to the $5000-$5000 area, where we will shoot back up and bounce towards around $6700 or so (maybe a little less). From there one, we will likely enter a sideways trend, which we will continue until we see higher highs and higher lows and parabolic movement returns, which could lead to us challenging the all-time high, and hitting $35k-$50k. 

NOTE: I seem to have reached the max character limit for this section of the idea, so I will continue my text below.

Comment:
					Onto the short-term: 


Scenario A: 

The reason why I have drawn this movement into a pennant is this way, is simply because we have been moving through this ascending triangle for quite a while now (May 23rd to today). I don't think that the pattern will be sufficient to directly lead into a strong sell-off, but we should consider that the size of ascending triangle suggests a small movement downwards at the very least, which can create a higher low, and thus move into position into a bearish pennant. Why would a bearish pennant occur here and not have a bounce to $8500-$8700? The reason is in positioning - the huge downtrend (May 5th to May 26th) creates a very nice flagpole in which it hits around the $5000 area very perfectly, and thus I would not be surprised if this happens. 

Second reason: on the Stoch RSI indicator on the daily chart, it appears to be dangerously high, which would suggest it being oversold. For the most part, it seems to have called lows and highs, at least to some extent. This overdrawn movement may very well have increased the likelyhood of Bitcoin being oversold. This could suggest that this is the last step into a sharp downturn, but this does not preclude Situation B. Volume has also been steadily decreasing, but this is the case with any sort of consolidation, I believe. 

Finally, the lines I have drawn below the triangle are simply bounces that I think seem fairly reasonable. The length from to support to the lines correlate with the length of the flagpole, of course, though it may seem chopped off due to the huge line from the long-term support downwards. 


Scenario B: 

This is much simpler, Bitcoin hits the upper resistance line, bounces off, challenges the lower support line, and we potentially see a break, and the rest unfolds from there. 


----------------------------------------------------------------------- 


With all this being said, do not fear if you are hoping for more parabolic movement - this likely will not be the end, and will simply be the set up for a long, drawn out sideways movement until the first signs of bullish activity begin and we start all over again. If you are longing around here, please consider using risk management, prepare for every possibility. If you are shorting, the same applies. 

Please trade with care. I wish the best to all traders!

Comment:
					This really is a very minor note, but I just want to emphasize that the rising wedge (which I erroneously refer to as an ascending triangle, a bad habit I have) entering a bearish pennant is more based on intuition than anything. Also, this pennant is mainly based on the conservative assumption that the break will happen at 7900, if it happens at 7700 where we seem to be general resistance, the pennant would look something like this:

I am Mid term-bullish on  BTC -1.40%  going into the end of this week, but looking to get into the market on a pull back to occur before I get in to the market.  The jury is still out as to whether this weekly bear trend is ready to turn around.  

We can see that both the  RSI  and  MFI  are both  Bullish  on the daily having bottomed when reaching oversold on both at c. $7k support where we found our longer term  trend line . 

We are currently in the process of meeting the Tenkan (blue line) as I write this, so in the very short term, I am looking for a pull back to $7550 range for an entry.  One of the main reasons for this is that on the 4hour timeframes we are close to completing an edge to edge trade so the risk reward doesn’t fit my profile, however a break out from the cloud or above the Tenkan around $7777 will make me enter the market. 

The  RSI  and  MFI  have both been excellent indicators in this bear market.  Whenever  RSI  has gone above the 60 and the  MFI  80; its time to exit the market from a  bullish  trade and consider shorting as it progresses higher.   

Based on the  RSI ,  MFI  trends and the fact that we will run into the Kijun at just around $8-8.2k, I will be scalling out at this  bearish  confluence level to start looking for pull backs and reassessment as i believe it to be a key point as  

Best case scenario this trade would yield a 10% return before leverage. 
This is for illustrative purposes only, please DYOR and goodluck with your trading.

So the pullback trade that we were looking at worked out & has made it's way back to the neckline level of structure. We are now at what i like to call a ""decision point"" Essentially IF price is able to violate this current level od structure THEN we're likely to continue to our next price projection.  

Something that a lot of newer traders don't understand is that when it comes to bigger moves, the market will often provide multiple opportunities to get involved. For those who don't rush and for those who don't get discouraged. If you perform consistent analysis you can often find multiple ways to involve yourself in a trade even if you missed the first strike.

I am never good with words so instead of writing paragraphs of clarification to justify my call for SHORT since my last posting, I have explained everything on my chart with the least words possible using Fibonacci. It does not matter how popular  Bitcoin -1.35%  has become, or how deep it has disrupted the financial sector, or how many institutional investors have come to invest in it -- the psychology behind a market cycle does not change. 

I don't really encourage anyone to short  Bitcoin -1.35% , but in all honesty, don't expect the bulls to fly anytime soon. Like I said before, this correction that we are having right now is the ""MOTHER OF ALL CORRECTIONS"" after a 4-year-long bull cycle since the 2013 correction... and we are just halfway through.

My best idea ever, taking some time off the last 2 days :) The whales just continue to play their little games by squeezing leveraged short and long positions out of the market. Can't play them, it's just too easy. Maybe it's time we retail traders stand together, combine our  volume  and use their own game against them. Yeah, maybe we could even make a blockbuster movie about this :) I love me some science fiction :) LOL  

My last update of the previous analysis i showed 2 important support levels where the price could bounce up from. The first support around 7350 did the trick and the price got pushed back to 7700. From that point on i told my members that i thought i was seeing distribution, but it was still very confusing to figure out what was going on. TA was showing  bullish  signs, that  bull flag  was very strong and was even turning slowly up and was about to squeeze upwards. But of course out of no where the price got dumped, the move we saw a few hours ago. After that 200 point drop the price got pushed up again to 7700 like that dump was a glitch. If your a whale, why not push out leveraged traders and take your money while your accumulating or distributing. It's like a bonus, like the cherry on top :)  

Anyway, in this chart we can see allot of similarities of what is going on. As you know i have been saying i am still  bearish  for the medium term, but i just could not say what was going to happen on the short term. 2 days ago after we finally dropped out of that  wedge , i said we would have 2 options.  
- Break those 2 support levels from the last update of my previous chart (73xx and 71xx) 
- Make a higher low at those same support levels and make another move up above the high.  
 
As we can see in the chart, the  fractal  is not 100% identical so it's no guarantee that the 7700 high we just saw is the high already and that we start to move down. But based on this  fractal , i don't want to see the price get above the 7800/7900. This  fractal  confirms my  bearish  view as well. That's why TA is so great, you can turn any chart to fit your view :). 

Even without this  fractal , i just give it a very small chance that 7K price action is the fundament of a low to start another bull rally, i just highly doubt that. I want to see more  volume  to begin with and at least  double bottom  kind of formation. So the minimum i expect is a test of the 7100/6900in the coming week or 2. But the movement i have in mind for the med term is a drop below the 7K to form a big V shape low. If we get to see that, than i might even become  bullish  for the rest of the year :).  

As long as the price stays above the 73xx, we have to assume the bulls are still in control and we should see another wave up. So for me the 73xx is an important turning point.  


Don't forget to like if you appreciate this :)

Comment:
					At the moment it looks like bulls are trying to push higher, this bull flag/triangle is still very strong. So no sign of weakness yet! First small sign would be a drop below 7620/7600. Bulls need to break 7700

Comment:
					This is my bigger picture, think this bearish triangle is still 100% in play. I think if bulls can't break the 7800/7900 the bearish version is probably going to happen. Can't say HOW it will go, this blue line is just a guess. But a big V shape low would be the most bullish for the long term. I still think we are seeing distribution here. The only way this idea can be countered, is through a big increase of buying volume, if that doesn't happen, i think it's only a matter of time.

					Lower time frame we can see a new upwards channel and maybe even a rising wedge. From the looks of it, it's slowly going down to test the support line again. Depending on what will happen there we can make a better prediction for the rest of the day.

The price took a small dump but the volume was low so no real read on what the intent was. So we might see another move up, if we start to see a small pump that takes out the 7800, be aware of a fake breakout. The blue line is a possibility of what the move could look like IF we move up and if the breakout fails. If that happens than we will probably get confirmation if the price breaks the 7600ish. If we break the 7800 it should stay above the 7700 to confirm another move up. Not much more to say about what's going on.

325,1528359434.0,Taiwan_Bear,2618 (Double top & 0.618 pull-back) - do not miss it!!,"
In the last couple of TAs I have mentioned the “2618 pattern” and have been asked what 2618 means. Sorry for taking it so long as it took me quite a while to put everything altogether. But, as promised, I have explained below the rules and trade setups for the 2618 pattern.  

What are the rules/setups/steps for 2618?  
1.	Form a  double top  (Note #1)  
2.	Neckline has to be broken  
3.	After price found support at point (b), wait for pull back to 0.618 fib retracement of (a)(b)  
4.	After price retraced to 0.618, look for confluence and sell (eg. Structures,  trendlines  ,  double top  on a lower time frame,  rsi  divergence,  bearish pin bar  ,  inside bar  break down etc.) (Note #2)  
5.	Stop loss to be set above  double top 
6.	Set Take Profit levels (Note #3)  

Note #1 ( Double top ):  
The first step for the formation of 2618 is to form a  double top  at key resistance levels. Why at key resistance levels? Because we want to avoid fake double tops which can occur occasionally.  

There are some variations between various resources (books, websites) regarding the definitions of “double top”. The main differences occur where:  
a)	Some said for a  double top  to be valid, the wick of the 2nd top cannot exceed the wick of the 1st top; whereas, others said:  
b)	The wick of the 2nd top can exceed the wick of the 1st top but the candle close of the 2nd top CANNOT exceed the wick of the 1st top; or  
c)	The wick of the 2nd top can exceed the wick of the 1st top and the candle close of the 2nd top CAN exceed the wick of the 1st top; or  
d)	The wick of the 2nd top meets at least the candle close of the 1st top; or  
e)	The body of the 2nd top cannot exceed the body of the 1st top  

Personally, I would say all the above definitions work just fine although I do prefer definition a) because it means that the selling pressure is strong and the bulls fail to make a higher high. When there is a higher high formed in a downtrend, it can mean the downtrend has reversed and therefore you might not want to sell when the price pulls back to the 0.618 fib retracement.  

Note #2 ( 0.618 retracement ):  
When the price pulls back to 0.618, it does not mean to sell straight away. There must be more than one reason to sell other than the 0.618 retrace. The more reasons the better. In this example, you can see there are certainly structures (key resistance levels) at the 0.618 retrace. As well, there was a  double top  formed on the lower time frame. Consequently, you can sell.  

After  BTC -1.34%  hit the 0.618 retrace the first time, the price dropped from $9735 to $8650. but quickly bounced back to the 0.618 retrace level. That was a second & better opportunity to sell. Not only did  BTC -1.34%  form a  double top  on the larger time frame, but also with a  bearish  divergence on the 4hr time frame. Accordingly, you have more reasons to sell.  

Note #3 (Set take profit)  
Same as the rules of “Double top”, there are some variations as to which price level should you take profits. Personally, I would stick to the below:  
1)	First, take profit when risk/reward ratio hits 1:1 (recommend to take 30% - 50% profits and adjust the SL of the remaining positions to break-even)  
2)	When price hits the same price level as the low after the neckline is broken ((b) point in this example)  
3)	When price hits 1.272 fib extension of (a)(b)  
4)	When price hits point (d) (using  AB=CD  pattern. If you are not sure what the rules of  AB=CD  are, you can refer to my previous TA in which I have attached the link below)  
5)	If in a one-way market (heavily bearish/bullish), you can always keep 10% to 20% of your positions and take profits when risk/reward ratio hits 1:5 or even 1:10

 BTC -1.34%  is on the verge of breaking to a daily higher high on the bounce if the bulls can see a push this morning. 
If we reject from here the daily will form a lower high and we will see a tightening pattern within the highlighted  support and resistance  lines.  
Important for the bulls to show up or we could stay in this range into tomorrow.  
Healthy consolidation after the most recent bull move and the 15 min chart needs to change the trend.  
Also look to  EMA  12 support on the 4 hour and hourly.  
Another morning like yesterday with the bulls comfortable as worst case, we likely stay in the tightening pattern if bulls cannot prove themselves.

The current situation of  Bitcoin -1.32%  is quite difficult. We are on a clear treshold. A lot of traders are saying that we are on a clear downtrend, but the same amount of people are claiming that we will have our reversal soon. 

This article tries to sum up all important information you have to need! 

1: Retracement of a parabolic uptrend: 
There is a rule of thumb for the retracement of a parabolic uptrend. We should retrace to approx. the 0.786  Fibonacci Retracement  +/- 10%! 
Depending where we start the count, we are already in that target. Although both ways (blue and red) have still some space for a further downwave! 







2: The bloody support of Bitcoin: 
The average cost of mining one  bitcoin -1.32%  are at USA/Russia approx. 4700$ and at 3100$ for china! 
A drop below a target of 4700$ would be savage. Nevertheless, i can't image that we will hit that target. 







3: Manipulation of  Bitcoin -1.32%  and the Bart Simpson Pattern: 
A friend of mine found some unusual patterns in the orderbooks of several exchanges: 
https://twitter.com/CryptoSyndrome 
Altcoins are manipulated on a daily basis. It seems that  bitcoin -1.32%  is now affected to this too, which causes all these 3-5% pump and dumps. 
Thus, we are forming all the time the Bartin Simpsons Patterns. 

4: Similarity to 2014: 
Bitcoin -1.32%  now: 






Bitcoin -1.32%  2014: 







5: Deminishing downtrend and a strong support 
If we see the falling  wedges  as the force of the downtrend, then the force is diminishing! 
Furthermore we have strong support which is holding now for the 4th time! 







6: The Indicators 
Having a look at the indicators at 2D, we have a good potential for an upwave now. 
The  volume  is deminishing which should indicate a breakout soon. 
The  MACD  is about to cross, the  RSI  was slightly overbought and is heading up like the  Stoch .  RSI . 
The 200  EMA  is slighty under the current price and act as a support. 

7: The symetrical Triangle 
The theory says, that we should have in a  sym -1.72% . triangle 5 times an  ABC  wave. The waves are not perfect, but we can construct them. 






As you can see, the last four ABC-Waves formed always a 1:1 extention, which indicates that we have finished wave 5. 

8: A possible Head and Shoulders 
Even if this is not the most perfect  Head and Shoulders  Pattern, it's still valid! 
We are currently at the neckline, which is a strong and important resistance. Breaking upwards should indicate a good uptrend. 







9: The magic  6th 0.00%  of the month 






Suprisingly we have on every  6th 0.00%  of the month a reversal. Why is that??? 
One reason could be the  CME Group Futures  with dates for the settlements always nearby the  6th 0.00%  of the month! 
http://www.cmegroup.com 

10: Longterm  Bullish  TA 
The whole pattern could be seen as a big  bullish pennant . 







11: Shortterm  Bullish  TA 
Leading diagonal  starting wave1 of an  Elliott Wave , since we have now an impulse wave, after the 5x  ABC  pattern inside the triangle is finished. 
Our target should be at the top of the triangle nearby 8600-8800$. 







12: Longterm  Bearish  TA 
We also can argue, that we are currenty in an downtrend and the  sym -1.72% . triangle just continuing the trend. 
Our target should be nearby 6000$ which is also a finished downwards  Elliott Wave .

Nothing is happening in the market:  volatility  has become extinct and coins' trading fallen out of fashion. Range-bound bots and robotic humans absolutely prosper in this environment. The price was unable to break the 7700 threshold. For me this is a  bearish  signal. Indicators provide mixed signals, so let's examine wave structure. The move from May 29 is a  3-wave -0.12%  correction within a larger downtrend. A price drop below 7500 would confirm this scenario.

					Impulse Wave Truncation (Truncated Fifth) - 
Truncated 5th wave is when the market has become so over-extended in Wave 3 that there is not much force left for the impulse wave to come to a proper completion. So when this happens, there is a chance that the last wave of the impulse, Wave 5, will not reach the end of Wave 3 before the market starts correcting in the opposite direction. At this point, the market is just too exhausted. This condition is often called a “failure” or a “Truncation.”

I can see many people still believe that we are going inside a  descending triangle . I also believed this in my idea that i shard on may 1st: 



 

Things can change so quickly and if we didn't adapt to the changes then someone will. That's why i believe that we have to be in fast adapt mode in this market. Doesn't mean that you need to change without checking yourself. I try to find 2-3 confirmations before i change my idea on something. This includes pattern changes, trend changes etc 

There are 21 corrective wave patterns in EW which is categorized into major 3 corrective wave patterns: 

Zigzag  (5-3-5) 
Flat (3-3-5) 
Triangle (3-3-3-3-3) 

And other patterns are combinations of the above which is:  

Double three (A combination of two corrective patterns above) 
Triple three (A combination of three corrective patterns above) 

So what i can see now is that we are in two double three combination corrective wave pattern: 








More info here:  

https://elliottwave-forecast.com/elliott-wave-theory/#corrective-waves 

Confirmations: 

1. Wave ((i)) of C is 1.6k and ((v)) is going to be completed below the triangle 
2. Wave (E) of the triangle can't go beyond the triangle.  
3. This has happened twice before in 2013 & 2015 

Each wave  got 3 subwaves (a,b &c) inside and we are in the subwave c of ((y)) of Y which is an impulsive wave. 

Impulsive waves: 1,3,5,a,c 
Corrective waves: 2,4,b 

Normal Fibo Ratios for these waves are: 

wave 2 = 0.5 - 0.8 of wave 1  
wave 3 = 1.236 - 1.618 of wave 1  
wave 4 = 0.5 - 0.618 of wave 3  
wave 5 = 0.618 - 1 of wave 1  
wave B = 0.5 - 0.8 of wave A  
wave C = 0.618 - 1.236 of wave A  

Now if you check what happened in subwave a of ((y)) of Y you can see that: 

Wave (i) of a: 985$ 
Wave (ii) of a: 434$  
Wave ( iii -0.51% ) of a: 1207$  
Wave (iv) of a: 691$ [~0.618 of Wave ( iii -0.51% )] 
Wave (v) of a: 950$  








I have seen  BTC -1.32%  impulsive waves fibo ratios almost the same as the previous impulsive wave fibo ratios. 
Now if you apply the same for the last wave C of (E) this is what you get: 

Wave ((i)) of c: 1587$ 
Wave ((ii)) of c  = 793$ 
Wave (( iii -0.51% )) of c  = 1961$ 
Wave ((iv)) of c [~0.618 of Wave (( iii -0.51% ))] = 1212$ 
Wave ((v)) of c  = 1587$ 








Also note that Wave ((iv)) might not retrace upto 0.618 of Wave (( iii -0.51% )) as everyone will be in panic mode by that time so minimum retracement would be around 0.386 of Wave (( iii -0.51% )) which is around 756$ and this is why i can see it goes down to 5k level or little bit more towards 4.7k which is the lowest level of the  support zone  (orange dotted lines) 








So 3 Possible Support lines for reversal would be 

1. Blue: 5800 - 6100 (Only possible if Wave ((v)) is truncated) 
2. Orange: 4700 - 5000 (This is most likely where we heading)  
3. Red: 4100 - 4400 (Only possible if Wave (( iii -0.51% )) is extended)

 Bitcoin -1.31%  has recently developed an interesting pattern of completing a  bullish  and  bearish  cycle on the sixth of every month in an alternating order. As we can see in the chart above, a fall is followed by a rise. This has happened twice before and is expected to happen again now on the  6th 0.00%  of June, 2018. This time  Bitcoin -1.31%  will finish a  bearish  cycle and I expected to begin the next  bullish  cycle at least till the end of  6th 0.00%  of July, 2018. 

This pattern of rise and fall is also supported by other patterns on the chart that signal a  bullish  reversal. The support line has also held firmly and if this pattern of alternating rise and fall ensues,  Bitcoin -1.31%  could very well make new highs by the end of the year. The  RSI  is recovering from oversold levels and has now approached a normal.  Bitcoin -1.31%  is currently at a favorable point for  bullish  entries. The price broke a long term resistance as it break past the downtrend line in April, 2018. This was a big accomplishment for the bulls but the lack of confidence pulled the price back to the support line. Currently, the price is just above the support line and appears to be all set for a  bullish  comeback but the reality is, there are not enough bulls in the market. 

The past few months have been devastating for the price of  Bitcoin -1.31%  ( BTC -1.31% ) and a lot of investors are still running scared. Institutional investors are looking for more clarity regarding regulations concerning cryptocurrencies and also safer ways to invest and store their coins. As for retail investors, most of them comprise of first time investors who have never traded any financial asset before. So, when they saw that  Bitcoin -1.31%  ( BTC -1.31% ) is making 20% gains every day, they thought this could go on forever and jumped with both feet, only to find the carpet pulled under from their feet. Big investors have always played small investors as cannon fodder and have gotten away with their schemes even in regulated markets like forex or the stock market. Cryptocurrencies is a new market with no proper regulations which means it is natural to expect that those who can afford to not play by the rules, most likely won’t.

Hello friends,  

It's been a while since my last post; lack of time and an urge to do more research has mainly driven me to take a break from posting ideas on TradingView. I am still in the process of doing more research and study, but I figure posting once in a while couldn't hurt. 

Since I have become recently very convinced about this, I am outlining a very possible situation with  Bitcoin -1.30%  where the  trend line  we have been on since early October breaks, reaching around a temporary low of $5000. This is examined on the  daily chart , since this is one of the best charts to examine trends of this size. I have to first and foremost say that I am not trying to spread fear, I know many people do not like to hear  bearish  ideas, but  technical analysis  is ultimately a rational exercise, and I feel that possibilities with very strong signs should be explored. 

There are a few things to look at, but I first want to talk about the big picture with, long-term  support and resistance  lines. I think most people can agree that there was a very significant downtrending resistance line that began from the peak of the  ATH 0.63%  in late December, to the low of around $6400 (thick red line). After the break from that line, it seems we moved into a sideways trend, bouncing back and forth between an emerging downtrending resistance line (light red) and a support line that we seem to have been respecting since mid-October (light green); at least this appears to be the case with the lows, where the angle's effectiveness appears very strongly. Finally, based on previous bounces, we can establish a support of around $5000-$5300 (I've thus created a small  support zone  around that range, in dark green), as well as lower supports around $3200 and $2000 (though I do not believe these will be reached, in dark green).   

Now, onto the analysis - it's no secret that  Bitcoin -1.30%  has been squeezing in, ready for a significant move either upwards or downwards. Initially I considered the upwards move to be more likely due to the significant media attention cryptocurrency has been receiving, but after viewing previous market cycles of  Bitcoin -1.30%  (check 2013), it seems clear to me that the  bearish  scenario of closing in on the market cycle is very likely, and should at the very least be prepared for with proper risk management. According to Dow Theory, which is said to have laid the foundations of modern  technical analysis , history repeats itself, and this is a situation where we forced to consider this. 

Should we break from the line, we will likely fall straight down to the $5000-$5000 area, where we will shoot back up and bounce towards around $6700 or so (maybe a little less). From there one, we will likely enter a sideways trend, which we will continue until we see higher highs and higher lows and parabolic movement returns, which could lead to us challenging the all-time high, and hitting $35k-$50k. 

NOTE: I seem to have reached the max character limit for this section of the idea, so I will continue my text below.

Comment:
					Onto the short-term: 


Scenario A: 

The reason why I have drawn this movement into a pennant is this way, is simply because we have been moving through this ascending triangle for quite a while now (May 23rd to today). I don't think that the pattern will be sufficient to directly lead into a strong sell-off, but we should consider that the size of ascending triangle suggests a small movement downwards at the very least, which can create a higher low, and thus move into position into a bearish pennant. Why would a bearish pennant occur here and not have a bounce to $8500-$8700? The reason is in positioning - the huge downtrend (May 5th to May 26th) creates a very nice flagpole in which it hits around the $5000 area very perfectly, and thus I would not be surprised if this happens. 

Second reason: on the Stoch RSI indicator on the daily chart, it appears to be dangerously high, which would suggest it being oversold. For the most part, it seems to have called lows and highs, at least to some extent. This overdrawn movement may very well have increased the likelyhood of Bitcoin being oversold. This could suggest that this is the last step into a sharp downturn, but this does not preclude Situation B. Volume has also been steadily decreasing, but this is the case with any sort of consolidation, I believe. 

Finally, the lines I have drawn below the triangle are simply bounces that I think seem fairly reasonable. The length from to support to the lines correlate with the length of the flagpole, of course, though it may seem chopped off due to the huge line from the long-term support downwards. 


Scenario B: 

This is much simpler, Bitcoin hits the upper resistance line, bounces off, challenges the lower support line, and we potentially see a break, and the rest unfolds from there. 


----------------------------------------------------------------------- 


With all this being said, do not fear if you are hoping for more parabolic movement - this likely will not be the end, and will simply be the set up for a long, drawn out sideways movement until the first signs of bullish activity begin and we start all over again. If you are longing around here, please consider using risk management, prepare for every possibility. If you are shorting, the same applies. 

Please trade with care. I wish the best to all traders!

Comment:
					This really is a very minor note, but I just want to emphasize that the rising wedge (which I erroneously refer to as an ascending triangle, a bad habit I have) entering a bearish pennant is more based on intuition than anything. Also, this pennant is mainly based on the conservative assumption that the break will happen at 7900, if it happens at 7700 where we seem to be general resistance, the pennant would look something like this:

I am Mid term-bullish on  BTC -1.30%  going into the end of this week, but looking to get into the market on a pull back to occur before I get in to the market.  The jury is still out as to whether this weekly bear trend is ready to turn around.  

We can see that both the  RSI  and  MFI  are both  Bullish  on the daily having bottomed when reaching oversold on both at c. $7k support where we found our longer term  trend line . 

We are currently in the process of meeting the Tenkan (blue line) as I write this, so in the very short term, I am looking for a pull back to $7550 range for an entry.  One of the main reasons for this is that on the 4hour timeframes we are close to completing an edge to edge trade so the risk reward doesn’t fit my profile, however a break out from the cloud or above the Tenkan around $7777 will make me enter the market. 

The  RSI  and  MFI  have both been excellent indicators in this bear market.  Whenever  RSI  has gone above the 60 and the  MFI  80; its time to exit the market from a  bullish  trade and consider shorting as it progresses higher.   

Based on the  RSI ,  MFI  trends and the fact that we will run into the Kijun at just around $8-8.2k, I will be scalling out at this  bearish  confluence level to start looking for pull backs and reassessment as i believe it to be a key point as  

Best case scenario this trade would yield a 10% return before leverage. 
This is for illustrative purposes only, please DYOR and goodluck with your trading.

So the pullback trade that we were looking at worked out & has made it's way back to the neckline level of structure. We are now at what i like to call a ""decision point"" Essentially IF price is able to violate this current level od structure THEN we're likely to continue to our next price projection.  

Something that a lot of newer traders don't understand is that when it comes to bigger moves, the market will often provide multiple opportunities to get involved. For those who don't rush and for those who don't get discouraged. If you perform consistent analysis you can often find multiple ways to involve yourself in a trade even if you missed the first strike.

Here is a chart that we can understand the future price action and where to buy back. Before you guys start blasting my comment section with the time and how it may not be right thats correct. I am not calculating the time I'm just making a technical drawing of the directions that we will see in the next few months.  

Recent price action has clear signs of wash trading / market manipulation fud and lots of nonsense. Its hard to prove almost impossible so as a trader we just need to deal with it. Ideally the situation you are supposed to trade are critical break up and break down points to enter the trade. Dont enter or exit dumb trades and lose money. As an experienced trader you should be looking for shorts, I would not consider a long unless we are over $10-12k

I am never good with words so instead of writing paragraphs of clarification to justify my call for SHORT since my last posting, I have explained everything on my chart with the least words possible using Fibonacci. It does not matter how popular  Bitcoin -1.30%  has become, or how deep it has disrupted the financial sector, or how many institutional investors have come to invest in it -- the psychology behind a market cycle does not change. 

I don't really encourage anyone to short  Bitcoin -1.30% , but in all honesty, don't expect the bulls to fly anytime soon. Like I said before, this correction that we are having right now is the ""MOTHER OF ALL CORRECTIONS"" after a 4-year-long bull cycle since the 2013 correction... and we are just halfway through.

My best idea ever, taking some time off the last 2 days :) The whales just continue to play their little games by squeezing leveraged short and long positions out of the market. Can't play them, it's just too easy. Maybe it's time we retail traders stand together, combine our  volume  and use their own game against them. Yeah, maybe we could even make a blockbuster movie about this :) I love me some science fiction :) LOL  

My last update of the previous analysis i showed 2 important support levels where the price could bounce up from. The first support around 7350 did the trick and the price got pushed back to 7700. From that point on i told my members that i thought i was seeing distribution, but it was still very confusing to figure out what was going on. TA was showing  bullish  signs, that  bull flag  was very strong and was even turning slowly up and was about to squeeze upwards. But of course out of no where the price got dumped, the move we saw a few hours ago. After that 200 point drop the price got pushed up again to 7700 like that dump was a glitch. If your a whale, why not push out leveraged traders and take your money while your accumulating or distributing. It's like a bonus, like the cherry on top :)  

Anyway, in this chart we can see allot of similarities of what is going on. As you know i have been saying i am still  bearish  for the medium term, but i just could not say what was going to happen on the short term. 2 days ago after we finally dropped out of that  wedge , i said we would have 2 options.  
- Break those 2 support levels from the last update of my previous chart (73xx and 71xx) 
- Make a higher low at those same support levels and make another move up above the high.  
 
As we can see in the chart, the  fractal  is not 100% identical so it's no guarantee that the 7700 high we just saw is the high already and that we start to move down. But based on this  fractal , i don't want to see the price get above the 7800/7900. This  fractal  confirms my  bearish  view as well. That's why TA is so great, you can turn any chart to fit your view :). 

Even without this  fractal , i just give it a very small chance that 7K price action is the fundament of a low to start another bull rally, i just highly doubt that. I want to see more  volume  to begin with and at least  double bottom  kind of formation. So the minimum i expect is a test of the 7100/6900in the coming week or 2. But the movement i have in mind for the med term is a drop below the 7K to form a big V shape low. If we get to see that, than i might even become  bullish  for the rest of the year :).  

As long as the price stays above the 73xx, we have to assume the bulls are still in control and we should see another wave up. So for me the 73xx is an important turning point.

					This is my bigger picture, think this bearish triangle is still 100% in play. I think if bulls can't break the 7800/7900 the bearish version is probably going to happen. Can't say HOW it will go, this blue line is just a guess. But a big V shape low would be the most bullish for the long term. I still think we are seeing distribution here. The only way this idea can be countered, is through a big increase of buying volume, if that doesn't happen, i think it's only a matter of time.

The price took a small dump but the volume was low so no real read on what the intent was. So we might see another move up, if we start to see a small pump that takes out the 7800, be aware of a fake breakout. The blue line is a possibility of what the move could look like IF we move up and if the breakout fails. If that happens than we will probably get confirmation if the price breaks the 7600ish. If we break the 7800 it should stay above the 7700 to confirm another move up. Not much more to say about what's going on.

343,1528359434.0,Taiwan_Bear,2618 (Double top & 0.618 pull-back) - do not miss it!!,"
In the last couple of TAs I have mentioned the “2618 pattern” and have been asked what 2618 means. Sorry for taking it so long as it took me quite a while to put everything altogether. But, as promised, I have explained below the rules and trade setups for the 2618 pattern.  

What are the rules/setups/steps for 2618?  
1.	Form a  double top  (Note #1)  
2.	Neckline has to be broken  
3.	After price found support at point (b), wait for pull back to 0.618 fib retracement of (a)(b)  
4.	After price retraced to 0.618, look for confluence and sell (eg. Structures,  trendlines  ,  double top  on a lower time frame,  rsi  divergence,  bearish pin bar  ,  inside bar  break down etc.) (Note #2)  
5.	Stop loss to be set above  double top 
6.	Set Take Profit levels (Note #3)  

Note #1 ( Double top ):  
The first step for the formation of 2618 is to form a  double top  at key resistance levels. Why at key resistance levels? Because we want to avoid fake double tops which can occur occasionally.  

There are some variations between various resources (books, websites) regarding the definitions of “double top”. The main differences occur where:  
a)	Some said for a  double top  to be valid, the wick of the 2nd top cannot exceed the wick of the 1st top; whereas, others said:  
b)	The wick of the 2nd top can exceed the wick of the 1st top but the candle close of the 2nd top CANNOT exceed the wick of the 1st top; or  
c)	The wick of the 2nd top can exceed the wick of the 1st top and the candle close of the 2nd top CAN exceed the wick of the 1st top; or  
d)	The wick of the 2nd top meets at least the candle close of the 1st top; or  
e)	The body of the 2nd top cannot exceed the body of the 1st top  

Personally, I would say all the above definitions work just fine although I do prefer definition a) because it means that the selling pressure is strong and the bulls fail to make a higher high. When there is a higher high formed in a downtrend, it can mean the downtrend has reversed and therefore you might not want to sell when the price pulls back to the 0.618 fib retracement.  

Note #2 ( 0.618 retracement ):  
When the price pulls back to 0.618, it does not mean to sell straight away. There must be more than one reason to sell other than the 0.618 retrace. The more reasons the better. In this example, you can see there are certainly structures (key resistance levels) at the 0.618 retrace. As well, there was a  double top  formed on the lower time frame. Consequently, you can sell.  

After  BTC -1.29%  hit the 0.618 retrace the first time, the price dropped from $9735 to $8650. but quickly bounced back to the 0.618 retrace level. That was a second & better opportunity to sell. Not only did  BTC -1.29%  form a  double top  on the larger time frame, but also with a  bearish  divergence on the 4hr time frame. Accordingly, you have more reasons to sell.  

Note #3 (Set take profit)  
Same as the rules of “Double top”, there are some variations as to which price level should you take profits. Personally, I would stick to the below:  
1)	First, take profit when risk/reward ratio hits 1:1 (recommend to take 30% - 50% profits and adjust the SL of the remaining positions to break-even)  
2)	When price hits the same price level as the low after the neckline is broken ((b) point in this example)  
3)	When price hits 1.272 fib extension of (a)(b)  
4)	When price hits point (d) (using  AB=CD  pattern. If you are not sure what the rules of  AB=CD  are, you can refer to my previous TA in which I have attached the link below)  
5)	If in a one-way market (heavily bearish/bullish), you can always keep 10% to 20% of your positions and take profits when risk/reward ratio hits 1:5 or even 1:10

 BTC -1.29%  is on the verge of breaking to a daily higher high on the bounce if the bulls can see a push this morning. 
If we reject from here the daily will form a lower high and we will see a tightening pattern within the highlighted  support and resistance  lines.  
Important for the bulls to show up or we could stay in this range into tomorrow.  
Healthy consolidation after the most recent bull move and the 15 min chart needs to change the trend.  
Also look to  EMA  12 support on the 4 hour and hourly.  
Another morning like yesterday with the bulls comfortable as worst case, we likely stay in the tightening pattern if bulls cannot prove themselves.

The current situation of  Bitcoin -1.29%  is quite difficult. We are on a clear treshold. A lot of traders are saying that we are on a clear downtrend, but the same amount of people are claiming that we will have our reversal soon. 

This article tries to sum up all important information you have to need! 

1: Retracement of a parabolic uptrend: 
There is a rule of thumb for the retracement of a parabolic uptrend. We should retrace to approx. the 0.786  Fibonacci Retracement  +/- 10%! 
Depending where we start the count, we are already in that target. Although both ways (blue and red) have still some space for a further downwave! 







2: The bloody support of Bitcoin: 
The average cost of mining one  bitcoin -1.29%  are at USA/Russia approx. 4700$ and at 3100$ for china! 
A drop below a target of 4700$ would be savage. Nevertheless, i can't image that we will hit that target. 







3: Manipulation of  Bitcoin -1.29%  and the Bart Simpson Pattern: 
A friend of mine found some unusual patterns in the orderbooks of several exchanges: 
https://twitter.com/CryptoSyndrome 
Altcoins are manipulated on a daily basis. It seems that  bitcoin -1.29%  is now affected to this too, which causes all these 3-5% pump and dumps. 
Thus, we are forming all the time the Bartin Simpsons Patterns. 

4: Similarity to 2014: 
Bitcoin -1.29%  now: 






Bitcoin -1.29%  2014: 







5: Deminishing downtrend and a strong support 
If we see the falling  wedges  as the force of the downtrend, then the force is diminishing! 
Furthermore we have strong support which is holding now for the 4th time! 







6: The Indicators 
Having a look at the indicators at 2D, we have a good potential for an upwave now. 
The  volume  is deminishing which should indicate a breakout soon. 
The  MACD  is about to cross, the  RSI  was slightly overbought and is heading up like the  Stoch .  RSI . 
The 200  EMA  is slighty under the current price and act as a support. 

7: The symetrical Triangle 
The theory says, that we should have in a  sym -1.72% . triangle 5 times an  ABC  wave. The waves are not perfect, but we can construct them. 






As you can see, the last four ABC-Waves formed always a 1:1 extention, which indicates that we have finished wave 5. 

8: A possible Head and Shoulders 
Even if this is not the most perfect  Head and Shoulders  Pattern, it's still valid! 
We are currently at the neckline, which is a strong and important resistance. Breaking upwards should indicate a good uptrend. 







9: The magic  6th 0.00%  of the month 






Suprisingly we have on every  6th 0.00%  of the month a reversal. Why is that??? 
One reason could be the  CME Group Futures  with dates for the settlements always nearby the  6th 0.00%  of the month! 
http://www.cmegroup.com 

10: Longterm  Bullish  TA 
The whole pattern could be seen as a big  bullish pennant . 







11: Shortterm  Bullish  TA 
Leading diagonal  starting wave1 of an  Elliott Wave , since we have now an impulse wave, after the 5x  ABC  pattern inside the triangle is finished. 
Our target should be at the top of the triangle nearby 8600-8800$. 







12: Longterm  Bearish  TA 
We also can argue, that we are currenty in an downtrend and the  sym -1.72% . triangle just continuing the trend. 
Our target should be nearby 6000$ which is also a finished downwards  Elliott Wave .

Nothing is happening in the market:  volatility  has become extinct and coins' trading fallen out of fashion. Range-bound bots and robotic humans absolutely prosper in this environment. The price was unable to break the 7700 threshold. For me this is a  bearish  signal. Indicators provide mixed signals, so let's examine wave structure. The move from May 29 is a  3-wave -0.12%  correction within a larger downtrend. A price drop below 7500 would confirm this scenario.

					Impulse Wave Truncation (Truncated Fifth) - 
Truncated 5th wave is when the market has become so over-extended in Wave 3 that there is not much force left for the impulse wave to come to a proper completion. So when this happens, there is a chance that the last wave of the impulse, Wave 5, will not reach the end of Wave 3 before the market starts correcting in the opposite direction. At this point, the market is just too exhausted. This condition is often called a “failure” or a “Truncation.”

I can see many people still believe that we are going inside a  descending triangle . I also believed this in my idea that i shard on may 1st: 



 

Things can change so quickly and if we didn't adapt to the changes then someone will. That's why i believe that we have to be in fast adapt mode in this market. Doesn't mean that you need to change without checking yourself. I try to find 2-3 confirmations before i change my idea on something. This includes pattern changes, trend changes etc 

There are 21 corrective wave patterns in EW which is categorized into major 3 corrective wave patterns: 

Zigzag  (5-3-5) 
Flat (3-3-5) 
Triangle (3-3-3-3-3) 

And other patterns are combinations of the above which is:  

Double three (A combination of two corrective patterns above) 
Triple three (A combination of three corrective patterns above) 

So what i can see now is that we are in two double three combination corrective wave pattern: 








More info here:  

https://elliottwave-forecast.com/elliott-wave-theory/#corrective-waves 

Confirmations: 

1. Wave ((i)) of C is 1.6k and ((v)) is going to be completed below the triangle 
2. Wave (E) of the triangle can't go beyond the triangle.  
3. This has happened twice before in 2013 & 2015 

Each wave  got 3 subwaves (a,b &c) inside and we are in the subwave c of ((y)) of Y which is an impulsive wave. 

Impulsive waves: 1,3,5,a,c 
Corrective waves: 2,4,b 

Normal Fibo Ratios for these waves are: 

wave 2 = 0.5 - 0.8 of wave 1  
wave 3 = 1.236 - 1.618 of wave 1  
wave 4 = 0.5 - 0.618 of wave 3  
wave 5 = 0.618 - 1 of wave 1  
wave B = 0.5 - 0.8 of wave A  
wave C = 0.618 - 1.236 of wave A  

Now if you check what happened in subwave a of ((y)) of Y you can see that: 

Wave (i) of a: 985$ 
Wave (ii) of a: 434$  
Wave ( iii -0.47% ) of a: 1207$  
Wave (iv) of a: 691$ [~0.618 of Wave ( iii -0.47% )] 
Wave (v) of a: 950$  








I have seen  BTC -1.29%  impulsive waves fibo ratios almost the same as the previous impulsive wave fibo ratios. 
Now if you apply the same for the last wave C of (E) this is what you get: 

Wave ((i)) of c: 1587$ 
Wave ((ii)) of c  = 793$ 
Wave (( iii -0.47% )) of c  = 1961$ 
Wave ((iv)) of c [~0.618 of Wave (( iii -0.47% ))] = 1212$ 
Wave ((v)) of c  = 1587$ 








Also note that Wave ((iv)) might not retrace upto 0.618 of Wave (( iii -0.47% )) as everyone will be in panic mode by that time so minimum retracement would be around 0.386 of Wave (( iii -0.47% )) which is around 756$ and this is why i can see it goes down to 5k level or little bit more towards 4.7k which is the lowest level of the  support zone  (orange dotted lines) 








So 3 Possible Support lines for reversal would be 

1. Blue: 5800 - 6100 (Only possible if Wave ((v)) is truncated) 
2. Orange: 4700 - 5000 (This is most likely where we heading)  
3. Red: 4100 - 4400 (Only possible if Wave (( iii -0.47% )) is extended)

 Bitcoin -1.29%  has recently developed an interesting pattern of completing a  bullish  and  bearish  cycle on the sixth of every month in an alternating order. As we can see in the chart above, a fall is followed by a rise. This has happened twice before and is expected to happen again now on the  6th 0.00%  of June, 2018. This time  Bitcoin -1.29%  will finish a  bearish  cycle and I expected to begin the next  bullish  cycle at least till the end of  6th 0.00%  of July, 2018. 

This pattern of rise and fall is also supported by other patterns on the chart that signal a  bullish  reversal. The support line has also held firmly and if this pattern of alternating rise and fall ensues,  Bitcoin -1.29%  could very well make new highs by the end of the year. The  RSI  is recovering from oversold levels and has now approached a normal.  Bitcoin -1.29%  is currently at a favorable point for  bullish  entries. The price broke a long term resistance as it break past the downtrend line in April, 2018. This was a big accomplishment for the bulls but the lack of confidence pulled the price back to the support line. Currently, the price is just above the support line and appears to be all set for a  bullish  comeback but the reality is, there are not enough bulls in the market. 

The past few months have been devastating for the price of  Bitcoin -1.29%  ( BTC -1.29% ) and a lot of investors are still running scared. Institutional investors are looking for more clarity regarding regulations concerning cryptocurrencies and also safer ways to invest and store their coins. As for retail investors, most of them comprise of first time investors who have never traded any financial asset before. So, when they saw that  Bitcoin -1.29%  ( BTC -1.29% ) is making 20% gains every day, they thought this could go on forever and jumped with both feet, only to find the carpet pulled under from their feet. Big investors have always played small investors as cannon fodder and have gotten away with their schemes even in regulated markets like forex or the stock market. Cryptocurrencies is a new market with no proper regulations which means it is natural to expect that those who can afford to not play by the rules, most likely won’t.

Hello friends,  

It's been a while since my last post; lack of time and an urge to do more research has mainly driven me to take a break from posting ideas on TradingView. I am still in the process of doing more research and study, but I figure posting once in a while couldn't hurt. 

Since I have become recently very convinced about this, I am outlining a very possible situation with  Bitcoin -1.29%  where the  trend line  we have been on since early October breaks, reaching around a temporary low of $5000. This is examined on the  daily chart , since this is one of the best charts to examine trends of this size. I have to first and foremost say that I am not trying to spread fear, I know many people do not like to hear  bearish  ideas, but  technical analysis  is ultimately a rational exercise, and I feel that possibilities with very strong signs should be explored. 

There are a few things to look at, but I first want to talk about the big picture with, long-term  support and resistance  lines. I think most people can agree that there was a very significant downtrending resistance line that began from the peak of the  ATH 0.63%  in late December, to the low of around $6400 (thick red line). After the break from that line, it seems we moved into a sideways trend, bouncing back and forth between an emerging downtrending resistance line (light red) and a support line that we seem to have been respecting since mid-October (light green); at least this appears to be the case with the lows, where the angle's effectiveness appears very strongly. Finally, based on previous bounces, we can establish a support of around $5000-$5300 (I've thus created a small  support zone  around that range, in dark green), as well as lower supports around $3200 and $2000 (though I do not believe these will be reached, in dark green).   

Now, onto the analysis - it's no secret that  Bitcoin -1.29%  has been squeezing in, ready for a significant move either upwards or downwards. Initially I considered the upwards move to be more likely due to the significant media attention cryptocurrency has been receiving, but after viewing previous market cycles of  Bitcoin -1.29%  (check 2013), it seems clear to me that the  bearish  scenario of closing in on the market cycle is very likely, and should at the very least be prepared for with proper risk management. According to Dow Theory, which is said to have laid the foundations of modern  technical analysis , history repeats itself, and this is a situation where we forced to consider this. 

Should we break from the line, we will likely fall straight down to the $5000-$5000 area, where we will shoot back up and bounce towards around $6700 or so (maybe a little less). From there one, we will likely enter a sideways trend, which we will continue until we see higher highs and higher lows and parabolic movement returns, which could lead to us challenging the all-time high, and hitting $35k-$50k. 

NOTE: I seem to have reached the max character limit for this section of the idea, so I will continue my text below.

Comment:
					Onto the short-term: 


Scenario A: 

The reason why I have drawn this movement into a pennant is this way, is simply because we have been moving through this ascending triangle for quite a while now (May 23rd to today). I don't think that the pattern will be sufficient to directly lead into a strong sell-off, but we should consider that the size of ascending triangle suggests a small movement downwards at the very least, which can create a higher low, and thus move into position into a bearish pennant. Why would a bearish pennant occur here and not have a bounce to $8500-$8700? The reason is in positioning - the huge downtrend (May 5th to May 26th) creates a very nice flagpole in which it hits around the $5000 area very perfectly, and thus I would not be surprised if this happens. 

Second reason: on the Stoch RSI indicator on the daily chart, it appears to be dangerously high, which would suggest it being oversold. For the most part, it seems to have called lows and highs, at least to some extent. This overdrawn movement may very well have increased the likelyhood of Bitcoin being oversold. This could suggest that this is the last step into a sharp downturn, but this does not preclude Situation B. Volume has also been steadily decreasing, but this is the case with any sort of consolidation, I believe. 

Finally, the lines I have drawn below the triangle are simply bounces that I think seem fairly reasonable. The length from to support to the lines correlate with the length of the flagpole, of course, though it may seem chopped off due to the huge line from the long-term support downwards. 


Scenario B: 

This is much simpler, Bitcoin hits the upper resistance line, bounces off, challenges the lower support line, and we potentially see a break, and the rest unfolds from there. 


----------------------------------------------------------------------- 


With all this being said, do not fear if you are hoping for more parabolic movement - this likely will not be the end, and will simply be the set up for a long, drawn out sideways movement until the first signs of bullish activity begin and we start all over again. If you are longing around here, please consider using risk management, prepare for every possibility. If you are shorting, the same applies. 

Please trade with care. I wish the best to all traders!

Comment:
					This really is a very minor note, but I just want to emphasize that the rising wedge (which I erroneously refer to as an ascending triangle, a bad habit I have) entering a bearish pennant is more based on intuition than anything. Also, this pennant is mainly based on the conservative assumption that the break will happen at 7900, if it happens at 7700 where we seem to be general resistance, the pennant would look something like this:

Jun 7




I am Mid term-bullish on  BTC -1.29%  going into the end of this week, but looking to get into the market on a pull back to occur before I get in to the market.  The jury is still out as to whether this weekly bear trend is ready to turn around.  

We can see that both the  RSI  and  MFI  are both  Bullish  on the daily having bottomed when reaching oversold on both at c. $7k support where we found our longer term  trend line . 

We are currently in the process of meeting the Tenkan (blue line) as I write this, so in the very short term, I am looking for a pull back to $7550 range for an entry.  One of the main reasons for this is that on the 4hour timeframes we are close to completing an edge to edge trade so the risk reward doesn’t fit my profile, however a break out from the cloud or above the Tenkan around $7777 will make me enter the market. 

The  RSI  and  MFI  have both been excellent indicators in this bear market.  Whenever  RSI  has gone above the 60 and the  MFI  80; its time to exit the market from a  bullish  trade and consider shorting as it progresses higher.   

Based on the  RSI ,  MFI  trends and the fact that we will run into the Kijun at just around $8-8.2k, I will be scalling out at this  bearish  confluence level to start looking for pull backs and reassessment as i believe it to be a key point as  

Best case scenario this trade would yield a 10% return before leverage. 
This is for illustrative purposes only, please DYOR and goodluck with your trading.

So the pullback trade that we were looking at worked out & has made it's way back to the neckline level of structure. We are now at what i like to call a ""decision point"" Essentially IF price is able to violate this current level od structure THEN we're likely to continue to our next price projection.  

Something that a lot of newer traders don't understand is that when it comes to bigger moves, the market will often provide multiple opportunities to get involved. For those who don't rush and for those who don't get discouraged. If you perform consistent analysis you can often find multiple ways to involve yourself in a trade even if you missed the first strike.

Here is a chart that we can understand the future price action and where to buy back. Before you guys start blasting my comment section with the time and how it may not be right thats correct. I am not calculating the time I'm just making a technical drawing of the directions that we will see in the next few months.  

Recent price action has clear signs of wash trading / market manipulation fud and lots of nonsense. Its hard to prove almost impossible so as a trader we just need to deal with it. Ideally the situation you are supposed to trade are critical break up and break down points to enter the trade. Dont enter or exit dumb trades and lose money. As an experienced trader you should be looking for shorts, I would not consider a long unless we are over $10-12k

I am never good with words so instead of writing paragraphs of clarification to justify my call for SHORT since my last posting, I have explained everything on my chart with the least words possible using Fibonacci. It does not matter how popular  Bitcoin -1.29%  has become, or how deep it has disrupted the financial sector, or how many institutional investors have come to invest in it -- the psychology behind a market cycle does not change. 

I don't really encourage anyone to short  Bitcoin -1.29% , but in all honesty, don't expect the bulls to fly anytime soon.

My best idea ever, taking some time off the last 2 days :) The whales just continue to play their little games by squeezing leveraged short and long positions out of the market. Can't play them, it's just too easy. Maybe it's time we retail traders stand together, combine our  volume  and use their own game against them. Yeah, maybe we could even make a blockbuster movie about this :) I love me some science fiction :) LOL  

My last update of the previous analysis i showed 2 important support levels where the price could bounce up from. The first support around 7350 did the trick and the price got pushed back to 7700. From that point on i told my members that i thought i was seeing distribution, but it was still very confusing to figure out what was going on. TA was showing  bullish  signs, that  bull flag  was very strong and was even turning slowly up and was about to squeeze upwards. But of course out of no where the price got dumped, the move we saw a few hours ago. After that 200 point drop the price got pushed up again to 7700 like that dump was a glitch. If your a whale, why not push out leveraged traders and take your money while your accumulating or distributing. It's like a bonus, like the cherry on top :)  

Anyway, in this chart we can see allot of similarities of what is going on. As you know i have been saying i am still  bearish  for the medium term, but i just could not say what was going to happen on the short term. 2 days ago after we finally dropped out of that  wedge , i said we would have 2 options.  
- Break those 2 support levels from the last update of my previous chart (73xx and 71xx) 
- Make a higher low at those same support levels and make another move up above the high.  
 
As we can see in the chart, the  fractal  is not 100% identical so it's no guarantee that the 7700 high we just saw is the high already and that we start to move down. But based on this  fractal , i don't want to see the price get above the 7800/7900. This  fractal  confirms my  bearish  view as well. That's why TA is so great, you can turn any chart to fit your view :). 

Even without this  fractal , i just give it a very small chance that 7K price action is the fundament of a low to start another bull rally, i just highly doubt that. I want to see more  volume  to begin with and at least  double bottom  kind of formation. So the minimum i expect is a test of the 7100/6900in the coming week or 2. But the movement i have in mind for the med term is a drop below the 7K to form a big V shape low. If we get to see that, than i might even become  bullish  for the rest of the year :).  

As long as the price stays above the 73xx, we have to assume the bulls are still in control and we should see another wave up. So for me the 73xx is an important turning point.

					At the moment it looks like bulls are trying to push higher, this bull flag/triangle is still very strong. So no sign of weakness yet! First small sign would be a drop below 7620/7600. Bulls need to break 7700

					This is my bigger picture, think this bearish triangle is still 100% in play. I think if bulls can't break the 7800/7900 the bearish version is probably going to happen. Can't say HOW it will go, this blue line is just a guess. But a big V shape low would be the most bullish for the long term. I still think we are seeing distribution here. The only way this idea can be countered, is through a big increase of buying volume, if that doesn't happen, i think it's only a matter of time.

					Lower time frame we can see a new upwards channel and maybe even a rising wedge. From the looks of it, it's slowly going down to test the support line again. Depending on what will happen there we can make a better prediction for the rest of the day.

					What a surprise, nothing has changed :) 

The price took a small dump but the volume was low so no real read on what the intent was. So we might see another move up, if we start to see a small pump that takes out the 7800, be aware of a fake breakout. The blue line is a possibility of what the move could look like IF we move up and if the breakout fails. If that happens than we will probably get confirmation if the price breaks the 7600ish. If we break the 7800 it should stay above the 7700 to confirm another move up. Not much more to say about what's going on.

361,1528359434.0,Taiwan_Bear,2618 (Double top & 0.618 pull-back) - do not miss it!!,"
In the last couple of TAs I have mentioned the “2618 pattern” and have been asked what 2618 means. Sorry for taking it so long as it took me quite a while to put everything altogether. But, as promised, I have explained below the rules and trade setups for the 2618 pattern.  

What are the rules/setups/steps for 2618?  
1.	Form a  double top  (Note #1)  
2.	Neckline has to be broken  
3.	After price found support at point (b), wait for pull back to 0.618 fib retracement of (a)(b)  
4.	After price retraced to 0.618, look for confluence and sell (eg. Structures,  trendlines  ,  double top  on a lower time frame,  rsi  divergence,  bearish pin bar  ,  inside bar  break down etc.) (Note #2)  
5.	Stop loss to be set above  double top 
6.	Set Take Profit levels (Note #3)  

Note #1 ( Double top ):  
The first step for the formation of 2618 is to form a  double top  at key resistance levels. Why at key resistance levels? Because we want to avoid fake double tops which can occur occasionally.  

There are some variations between various resources (books, websites) regarding the definitions of “double top”. The main differences occur where:  
a)	Some said for a  double top  to be valid, the wick of the 2nd top cannot exceed the wick of the 1st top; whereas, others said:  
b)	The wick of the 2nd top can exceed the wick of the 1st top but the candle close of the 2nd top CANNOT exceed the wick of the 1st top; or  
c)	The wick of the 2nd top can exceed the wick of the 1st top and the candle close of the 2nd top CAN exceed the wick of the 1st top; or  
d)	The wick of the 2nd top meets at least the candle close of the 1st top; or  
e)	The body of the 2nd top cannot exceed the body of the 1st top  

Personally, I would say all the above definitions work just fine although I do prefer definition a) because it means that the selling pressure is strong and the bulls fail to make a higher high. When there is a higher high formed in a downtrend, it can mean the downtrend has reversed and therefore you might not want to sell when the price pulls back to the 0.618 fib retracement.  

Note #2 ( 0.618 retracement ):  
When the price pulls back to 0.618, it does not mean to sell straight away. There must be more than one reason to sell other than the 0.618 retrace. The more reasons the better. In this example, you can see there are certainly structures (key resistance levels) at the 0.618 retrace. As well, there was a  double top  formed on the lower time frame. Consequently, you can sell.  

After  BTC -1.34%  hit the 0.618 retrace the first time, the price dropped from $9735 to $8650. but quickly bounced back to the 0.618 retrace level. That was a second & better opportunity to sell. Not only did  BTC -1.34%  form a  double top  on the larger time frame, but also with a  bearish  divergence on the 4hr time frame. Accordingly, you have more reasons to sell.  

Note #3 (Set take profit)  
Same as the rules of “Double top”, there are some variations as to which price level should you take profits. Personally, I would stick to the below:  
1)	First, take profit when risk/reward ratio hits 1:1 (recommend to take 30% - 50% profits and adjust the SL of the remaining positions to break-even)  
2)	When price hits the same price level as the low after the neckline is broken ((b) point in this example)  
3)	When price hits 1.272 fib extension of (a)(b)  
4)	When price hits point (d) (using  AB=CD  pattern. If you are not sure what the rules of  AB=CD  are, you can refer to my previous TA in which I have attached the link below)  
5)	If in a one-way market (heavily bearish/bullish), you can always keep 10% to 20% of your positions and take profits when risk/reward ratio hits 1:5 or even 1:10

 BTC -1.34%  is on the verge of breaking to a daily higher high on the bounce if the bulls can see a push this morning. 
If we reject from here the daily will form a lower high and we will see a tightening pattern within the highlighted  support and resistance  lines.  
Important for the bulls to show up or we could stay in this range into tomorrow.  
Healthy consolidation after the most recent bull move and the 15 min chart needs to change the trend.  
Also look to  EMA  12 support on the 4 hour and hourly.  
Another morning like yesterday with the bulls comfortable as worst case, we likely stay in the tightening pattern if bulls cannot prove themselves.

The current situation of  Bitcoin -1.38%  is quite difficult. We are on a clear treshold. A lot of traders are saying that we are on a clear downtrend, but the same amount of people are claiming that we will have our reversal soon. 

This article tries to sum up all important information you have to need! 

1: Retracement of a parabolic uptrend: 
There is a rule of thumb for the retracement of a parabolic uptrend. We should retrace to approx. the 0.786  Fibonacci Retracement  +/- 10%! 
Depending where we start the count, we are already in that target. Although both ways (blue and red) have still some space for a further downwave! 







2: The bloody support of Bitcoin: 
The average cost of mining one  bitcoin -1.38%  are at USA/Russia approx. 4700$ and at 3100$ for china! 
A drop below a target of 4700$ would be savage. Nevertheless, i can't image that we will hit that target. 







3: Manipulation of  Bitcoin -1.38%  and the Bart Simpson Pattern: 
A friend of mine found some unusual patterns in the orderbooks of several exchanges: 
https://twitter.com/CryptoSyndrome 
Altcoins are manipulated on a daily basis. It seems that  bitcoin -1.38%  is now affected to this too, which causes all these 3-5% pump and dumps. 
Thus, we are forming all the time the Bartin Simpsons Patterns. 

4: Similarity to 2014: 
Bitcoin -1.38%  now: 






Bitcoin -1.38%  2014: 







5: Deminishing downtrend and a strong support 
If we see the falling  wedges  as the force of the downtrend, then the force is diminishing! 
Furthermore we have strong support which is holding now for the 4th time! 







6: The Indicators 
Having a look at the indicators at 2D, we have a good potential for an upwave now. 
The  volume  is deminishing which should indicate a breakout soon. 
The  MACD  is about to cross, the  RSI  was slightly overbought and is heading up like the  Stoch .  RSI . 
The 200  EMA  is slighty under the current price and act as a support. 

7: The symetrical Triangle 
The theory says, that we should have in a  sym -1.72% . triangle 5 times an  ABC  wave. The waves are not perfect, but we can construct them. 






As you can see, the last four ABC-Waves formed always a 1:1 extention, which indicates that we have finished wave 5. 

8: A possible Head and Shoulders 
Even if this is not the most perfect  Head and Shoulders  Pattern, it's still valid! 
We are currently at the neckline, which is a strong and important resistance. Breaking upwards should indicate a good uptrend. 







9: The magic  6th 0.00%  of the month 






Suprisingly we have on every  6th 0.00%  of the month a reversal. Why is that??? 
One reason could be the  CME Group Futures  with dates for the settlements always nearby the  6th 0.00%  of the month! 
http://www.cmegroup.com 

10: Longterm  Bullish  TA 
The whole pattern could be seen as a big  bullish pennant . 







11: Shortterm  Bullish  TA 
Leading diagonal  starting wave1 of an  Elliott Wave , since we have now an impulse wave, after the 5x  ABC  pattern inside the triangle is finished. 
Our target should be at the top of the triangle nearby 8600-8800$. 







12: Longterm  Bearish  TA 
We also can argue, that we are currenty in an downtrend and the  sym -1.72% . triangle just continuing the trend. 
Our target should be nearby 6000$ which is also a finished downwards  Elliott Wave .

Nothing is happening in the market:  volatility  has become extinct and coins' trading fallen out of fashion. Range-bound bots and robotic humans absolutely prosper in this environment. The price was unable to break the 7700 threshold. For me this is a  bearish  signal. Indicators provide mixed signals, so let's examine wave structure. The move from May 29 is a  3-wave -0.12%  correction within a larger downtrend. A price drop below 7500 would confirm this scenario.

					Impulse Wave Truncation (Truncated Fifth) - 
Truncated 5th wave is when the market has become so over-extended in Wave 3 that there is not much force left for the impulse wave to come to a proper completion. So when this happens, there is a chance that the last wave of the impulse, Wave 5, will not reach the end of Wave 3 before the market starts correcting in the opposite direction. At this point, the market is just too exhausted. This condition is often called a “failure” or a “Truncation.”

I can see many people still believe that we are going inside a  descending triangle . I also believed this in my idea that i shard on may 1st: 



 

Things can change so quickly and if we didn't adapt to the changes then someone will. That's why i believe that we have to be in fast adapt mode in this market. Doesn't mean that you need to change without checking yourself. I try to find 2-3 confirmations before i change my idea on something. This includes pattern changes, trend changes etc 

There are 21 corrective wave patterns in EW which is categorized into major 3 corrective wave patterns: 

Zigzag  (5-3-5) 
Flat (3-3-5) 
Triangle (3-3-3-3-3) 

And other patterns are combinations of the above which is:  

Double three (A combination of two corrective patterns above) 
Triple three (A combination of three corrective patterns above) 

So what i can see now is that we are in two double three combination corrective wave pattern: 








More info here:  

https://elliottwave-forecast.com/elliott-wave-theory/#corrective-waves 

Confirmations: 

1. Wave ((i)) of C is 1.6k and ((v)) is going to be completed below the triangle 
2. Wave (E) of the triangle can't go beyond the triangle.  
3. This has happened twice before in 2013 & 2015 

Each wave  got 3 subwaves (a,b &c) inside and we are in the subwave c of ((y)) of Y which is an impulsive wave. 

Impulsive waves: 1,3,5,a,c 
Corrective waves: 2,4,b 

Normal Fibo Ratios for these waves are: 

wave 2 = 0.5 - 0.8 of wave 1  
wave 3 = 1.236 - 1.618 of wave 1  
wave 4 = 0.5 - 0.618 of wave 3  
wave 5 = 0.618 - 1 of wave 1  
wave B = 0.5 - 0.8 of wave A  
wave C = 0.618 - 1.236 of wave A  

Now if you check what happened in subwave a of ((y)) of Y you can see that: 

Wave (i) of a: 985$ 
Wave (ii) of a: 434$  
Wave ( iii -0.47% ) of a: 1207$  
Wave (iv) of a: 691$ [~0.618 of Wave ( iii -0.47% )] 
Wave (v) of a: 950$  








I have seen  BTC -1.39%  impulsive waves fibo ratios almost the same as the previous impulsive wave fibo ratios. 
Now if you apply the same for the last wave C of (E) this is what you get: 

Wave ((i)) of c: 1587$ 
Wave ((ii)) of c  = 793$ 
Wave (( iii -0.47% )) of c  = 1961$ 
Wave ((iv)) of c [~0.618 of Wave (( iii -0.47% ))] = 1212$ 
Wave ((v)) of c  = 1587$ 








Also note that Wave ((iv)) might not retrace upto 0.618 of Wave (( iii -0.47% )) as everyone will be in panic mode by that time so minimum retracement would be around 0.386 of Wave (( iii -0.47% )) which is around 756$ and this is why i can see it goes down to 5k level or little bit more towards 4.7k which is the lowest level of the  support zone  (orange dotted lines) 








So 3 Possible Support lines for reversal would be 

1. Blue: 5800 - 6100 (Only possible if Wave ((v)) is truncated) 
2. Orange: 4700 - 5000 (This is most likely where we heading)  
3. Red: 4100 - 4400 (Only possible if Wave (( iii -0.47% )) is extended)

 Bitcoin -1.39%  has recently developed an interesting pattern of completing a  bullish  and  bearish  cycle on the sixth of every month in an alternating order. As we can see in the chart above, a fall is followed by a rise. This has happened twice before and is expected to happen again now on the  6th 0.00%  of June, 2018. This time  Bitcoin -1.39%  will finish a  bearish  cycle and I expected to begin the next  bullish  cycle at least till the end of  6th 0.00%  of July, 2018. 

This pattern of rise and fall is also supported by other patterns on the chart that signal a  bullish  reversal. The support line has also held firmly and if this pattern of alternating rise and fall ensues,  Bitcoin -1.39%  could very well make new highs by the end of the year. The  RSI  is recovering from oversold levels and has now approached a normal.  Bitcoin -1.39%  is currently at a favorable point for  bullish  entries. The price broke a long term resistance as it break past the downtrend line in April, 2018. This was a big accomplishment for the bulls but the lack of confidence pulled the price back to the support line. Currently, the price is just above the support line and appears to be all set for a  bullish  comeback but the reality is, there are not enough bulls in the market. 

The past few months have been devastating for the price of  Bitcoin -1.39%  ( BTC -1.39% ) and a lot of investors are still running scared. Institutional investors are looking for more clarity regarding regulations concerning cryptocurrencies and also safer ways to invest and store their coins. As for retail investors, most of them comprise of first time investors who have never traded any financial asset before. So, when they saw that  Bitcoin -1.39%  ( BTC -1.39% ) is making 20% gains every day, they thought this could go on forever and jumped with both feet, only to find the carpet pulled under from their feet. Big investors have always played small investors as cannon fodder and have gotten away with their schemes even in regulated markets like forex or the stock market. Cryptocurrencies is a new market with no proper regulations which means it is natural to expect that those who can afford to not play by the rules, most likely won’t.

Hello friends,  

It's been a while since my last post; lack of time and an urge to do more research has mainly driven me to take a break from posting ideas on TradingView. I am still in the process of doing more research and study, but I figure posting once in a while couldn't hurt. 

Since I have become recently very convinced about this, I am outlining a very possible situation with  Bitcoin -1.39%  where the  trend line  we have been on since early October breaks, reaching around a temporary low of $5000. This is examined on the  daily chart , since this is one of the best charts to examine trends of this size. I have to first and foremost say that I am not trying to spread fear, I know many people do not like to hear  bearish  ideas, but  technical analysis  is ultimately a rational exercise, and I feel that possibilities with very strong signs should be explored. 

There are a few things to look at, but I first want to talk about the big picture with, long-term  support and resistance  lines. I think most people can agree that there was a very significant downtrending resistance line that began from the peak of the  ATH 0.63%  in late December, to the low of around $6400 (thick red line). After the break from that line, it seems we moved into a sideways trend, bouncing back and forth between an emerging downtrending resistance line (light red) and a support line that we seem to have been respecting since mid-October (light green); at least this appears to be the case with the lows, where the angle's effectiveness appears very strongly. Finally, based on previous bounces, we can establish a support of around $5000-$5300 (I've thus created a small  support zone  around that range, in dark green), as well as lower supports around $3200 and $2000 (though I do not believe these will be reached, in dark green).   

Now, onto the analysis - it's no secret that  Bitcoin -1.39%  has been squeezing in, ready for a significant move either upwards or downwards. Initially I considered the upwards move to be more likely due to the significant media attention cryptocurrency has been receiving, but after viewing previous market cycles of  Bitcoin -1.39%  (check 2013), it seems clear to me that the  bearish  scenario of closing in on the market cycle is very likely, and should at the very least be prepared for with proper risk management. According to Dow Theory, which is said to have laid the foundations of modern  technical analysis , history repeats itself, and this is a situation where we forced to consider this. 

Should we break from the line, we will likely fall straight down to the $5000-$5000 area, where we will shoot back up and bounce towards around $6700 or so (maybe a little less). From there one, we will likely enter a sideways trend, which we will continue until we see higher highs and higher lows and parabolic movement returns, which could lead to us challenging the all-time high, and hitting $35k-$50k. 

NOTE: I seem to have reached the max character limit for this section of the idea, so I will continue my text below.

Comment:
					Onto the short-term: 


Scenario A: 

The reason why I have drawn this movement into a pennant is this way, is simply because we have been moving through this ascending triangle for quite a while now (May 23rd to today). I don't think that the pattern will be sufficient to directly lead into a strong sell-off, but we should consider that the size of ascending triangle suggests a small movement downwards at the very least, which can create a higher low, and thus move into position into a bearish pennant. Why would a bearish pennant occur here and not have a bounce to $8500-$8700? The reason is in positioning - the huge downtrend (May 5th to May 26th) creates a very nice flagpole in which it hits around the $5000 area very perfectly, and thus I would not be surprised if this happens. 

Second reason: on the Stoch RSI indicator on the daily chart, it appears to be dangerously high, which would suggest it being oversold. For the most part, it seems to have called lows and highs, at least to some extent. This overdrawn movement may very well have increased the likelyhood of Bitcoin being oversold. This could suggest that this is the last step into a sharp downturn, but this does not preclude Situation B. Volume has also been steadily decreasing, but this is the case with any sort of consolidation, I believe. 

Finally, the lines I have drawn below the triangle are simply bounces that I think seem fairly reasonable. The length from to support to the lines correlate with the length of the flagpole, of course, though it may seem chopped off due to the huge line from the long-term support downwards. 


Scenario B: 

This is much simpler, Bitcoin hits the upper resistance line, bounces off, challenges the lower support line, and we potentially see a break, and the rest unfolds from there. 


----------------------------------------------------------------------- 


With all this being said, do not fear if you are hoping for more parabolic movement - this likely will not be the end, and will simply be the set up for a long, drawn out sideways movement until the first signs of bullish activity begin and we start all over again. If you are longing around here, please consider using risk management, prepare for every possibility. If you are shorting, the same applies. 

Please trade with care. I wish the best to all traders!

Comment:
					This really is a very minor note, but I just want to emphasize that the rising wedge (which I erroneously refer to as an ascending triangle, a bad habit I have) entering a bearish pennant is more based on intuition than anything. Also, this pennant is mainly based on the conservative assumption that the break will happen at 7900, if it happens at 7700 where we seem to be general resistance, the pennant would look something like this:

I am Mid term-bullish on  BTC -1.39%  going into the end of this week, but looking to get into the market on a pull back to occur before I get in to the market.  The jury is still out as to whether this weekly bear trend is ready to turn around.  

We can see that both the  RSI  and  MFI  are both  Bullish  on the daily having bottomed when reaching oversold on both at c. $7k support where we found our longer term  trend line . 

We are currently in the process of meeting the Tenkan (blue line) as I write this, so in the very short term, I am looking for a pull back to $7550 range for an entry.  One of the main reasons for this is that on the 4hour timeframes we are close to completing an edge to edge trade so the risk reward doesn’t fit my profile, however a break out from the cloud or above the Tenkan around $7777 will make me enter the market. 

The  RSI  and  MFI  have both been excellent indicators in this bear market.  Whenever  RSI  has gone above the 60 and the  MFI  80; its time to exit the market from a  bullish  trade and consider shorting as it progresses higher.   

Based on the  RSI ,  MFI  trends and the fact that we will run into the Kijun at just around $8-8.2k, I will be scalling out at this  bearish  confluence level to start looking for pull backs and reassessment as i believe it to be a key point as  

Best case scenario this trade would yield a 10% return before leverage. 
This is for illustrative purposes only, please DYOR and goodluck with your trading.

So the pullback trade that we were looking at worked out & has made it's way back to the neckline level of structure. We are now at what i like to call a ""decision point"" Essentially IF price is able to violate this current level od structure THEN we're likely to continue to our next price projection.  

Something that a lot of newer traders don't understand is that when it comes to bigger moves, the market will often provide multiple opportunities to get involved. For those who don't rush and for those who don't get discouraged. If you perform consistent analysis you can often find multiple ways to involve yourself in a trade even if you missed the first strike.

Ideally the situation you are supposed to trade are critical break up and break down points to enter the trade. Dont enter or exit dumb trades and lose money. As an experienced trader you should be looking for shorts, I would not consider a long unless we are over $10-12k

I am never good with words so instead of writing paragraphs of clarification to justify my call for SHORT since my last posting, I have explained everything on my chart with the least words possible using Fibonacci. It does not matter how popular  Bitcoin -1.39%  has become, or how deep it has disrupted the financial sector, or how many institutional investors have come to invest in it -- the psychology behind a market cycle does not change. 

I don't really encourage anyone to short  Bitcoin -1.39% , but in all honesty, don't expect the bulls to fly anytime soon. Like I said before, this correction that we are having right now is the ""MOTHER OF ALL CORRECTIONS"" after a 4-year-long bull cycle since the 2013 correction... and we are just halfway through.

My best idea ever, taking some time off the last 2 days :) The whales just continue to play their little games by squeezing leveraged short and long positions out of the market. Can't play them, it's just too easy. Maybe it's time we retail traders stand together, combine our  volume  and use their own game against them. Yeah, maybe we could even make a blockbuster movie about this :) I love me some science fiction :) LOL  

My last update of the previous analysis i showed 2 important support levels where the price could bounce up from. The first support around 7350 did the trick and the price got pushed back to 7700. From that point on i told my members that i thought i was seeing distribution, but it was still very confusing to figure out what was going on. TA was showing  bullish  signs, that  bull flag  was very strong and was even turning slowly up and was about to squeeze upwards. But of course out of no where the price got dumped, the move we saw a few hours ago. After that 200 point drop the price got pushed up again to 7700 like that dump was a glitch. If your a whale, why not push out leveraged traders and take your money while your accumulating or distributing. It's like a bonus, like the cherry on top :)  

Anyway, in this chart we can see allot of similarities of what is going on. As you know i have been saying i am still  bearish  for the medium term, but i just could not say what was going to happen on the short term. 2 days ago after we finally dropped out of that  wedge , i said we would have 2 options.  
- Break those 2 support levels from the last update of my previous chart (73xx and 71xx) 
- Make a higher low at those same support levels and make another move up above the high.  
 
As we can see in the chart, the  fractal  is not 100% identical so it's no guarantee that the 7700 high we just saw is the high already and that we start to move down. But based on this  fractal , i don't want to see the price get above the 7800/7900. This  fractal  confirms my  bearish  view as well. That's why TA is so great, you can turn any chart to fit your view :). 

Even without this  fractal , i just give it a very small chance that 7K price action is the fundament of a low to start another bull rally, i just highly doubt that. I want to see more  volume  to begin with and at least  double bottom  kind of formation. So the minimum i expect is a test of the 7100/6900in the coming week or 2. But the movement i have in mind for the med term is a drop below the 7K to form a big V shape low. If we get to see that, than i might even become  bullish  for the rest of the year :).  

As long as the price stays above the 73xx, we have to assume the bulls are still in control and we should see another wave up. So for me the 73xx is an important turning point.

					At the moment it looks like bulls are trying to push higher, this bull flag/triangle is still very strong. So no sign of weakness yet! First small sign would be a drop below 7620/7600. Bulls need to break 7700

Comment:
					This is my bigger picture, think this bearish triangle is still 100% in play. I think if bulls can't break the 7800/7900 the bearish version is probably going to happen. Can't say HOW it will go, this blue line is just a guess. But a big V shape low would be the most bullish for the long term. I still think we are seeing distribution here. The only way this idea can be countered, is through a big increase of buying volume, if that doesn't happen, i think it's only a matter of time.

					Lower time frame we can see a new upwards channel and maybe even a rising wedge. From the looks of it, it's slowly going down to test the support line again. Depending on what will happen there we can make a better prediction for the rest of the day.

The price took a small dump but the volume was low so no real read on what the intent was. So we might see another move up, if we start to see a small pump that takes out the 7800, be aware of a fake breakout. The blue line is a possibility of what the move could look like IF we move up and if the breakout fails. If that happens than we will probably get confirmation if the price breaks the 7600ish. If we break the 7800 it should stay above the 7700 to confirm another move up. Not much more to say about what's going on.

379,1528359434.0,Taiwan_Bear,2618 (Double top & 0.618 pull-back) - do not miss it!!,"
In the last couple of TAs I have mentioned the “2618 pattern” and have been asked what 2618 means. Sorry for taking it so long as it took me quite a while to put everything altogether. But, as promised, I have explained below the rules and trade setups for the 2618 pattern.  

What are the rules/setups/steps for 2618?  
1.	Form a  double top  (Note #1)  
2.	Neckline has to be broken  
3.	After price found support at point (b), wait for pull back to 0.618 fib retracement of (a)(b)  
4.	After price retraced to 0.618, look for confluence and sell (eg. Structures,  trendlines  ,  double top  on a lower time frame,  rsi  divergence,  bearish pin bar  ,  inside bar  break down etc.) (Note #2)  
5.	Stop loss to be set above  double top 
6.	Set Take Profit levels (Note #3)  

Note #1 ( Double top ):  
The first step for the formation of 2618 is to form a  double top  at key resistance levels. Why at key resistance levels? Because we want to avoid fake double tops which can occur occasionally.  

There are some variations between various resources (books, websites) regarding the definitions of “double top”. The main differences occur where:  
a)	Some said for a  double top  to be valid, the wick of the 2nd top cannot exceed the wick of the 1st top; whereas, others said:  
b)	The wick of the 2nd top can exceed the wick of the 1st top but the candle close of the 2nd top CANNOT exceed the wick of the 1st top; or  
c)	The wick of the 2nd top can exceed the wick of the 1st top and the candle close of the 2nd top CAN exceed the wick of the 1st top; or  
d)	The wick of the 2nd top meets at least the candle close of the 1st top; or  
e)	The body of the 2nd top cannot exceed the body of the 1st top  

Personally, I would say all the above definitions work just fine although I do prefer definition a) because it means that the selling pressure is strong and the bulls fail to make a higher high. When there is a higher high formed in a downtrend, it can mean the downtrend has reversed and therefore you might not want to sell when the price pulls back to the 0.618 fib retracement.  

Note #2 ( 0.618 retracement ):  
When the price pulls back to 0.618, it does not mean to sell straight away. There must be more than one reason to sell other than the 0.618 retrace. The more reasons the better. In this example, you can see there are certainly structures (key resistance levels) at the 0.618 retrace. As well, there was a  double top  formed on the lower time frame. Consequently, you can sell.  

After  BTC -1.39%  hit the 0.618 retrace the first time, the price dropped from $9735 to $8650. but quickly bounced back to the 0.618 retrace level. That was a second & better opportunity to sell. Not only did  BTC -1.39%  form a  double top  on the larger time frame, but also with a  bearish  divergence on the 4hr time frame. Accordingly, you have more reasons to sell.  

Note #3 (Set take profit)  
Same as the rules of “Double top”, there are some variations as to which price level should you take profits. Personally, I would stick to the below:  
1)	First, take profit when risk/reward ratio hits 1:1 (recommend to take 30% - 50% profits and adjust the SL of the remaining positions to break-even)  
2)	When price hits the same price level as the low after the neckline is broken ((b) point in this example)  
3)	When price hits 1.272 fib extension of (a)(b)  
4)	When price hits point (d) (using  AB=CD  pattern. If you are not sure what the rules of  AB=CD  are, you can refer to my previous TA in which I have attached the link below)  
5)	If in a one-way market (heavily bearish/bullish), you can always keep 10% to 20% of your positions and take profits when risk/reward ratio hits 1:5 or even 1:10

 BTC -1.39%  is on the verge of breaking to a daily higher high on the bounce if the bulls can see a push this morning. 
If we reject from here the daily will form a lower high and we will see a tightening pattern within the highlighted  support and resistance  lines.  
Important for the bulls to show up or we could stay in this range into tomorrow.  
Healthy consolidation after the most recent bull move and the 15 min chart needs to change the trend.  
Also look to  EMA  12 support on the 4 hour and hourly.  
Another morning like yesterday with the bulls comfortable as worst case, we likely stay in the tightening pattern if bulls cannot prove themselves.

The current situation of  Bitcoin -1.36%  is quite difficult. We are on a clear treshold. A lot of traders are saying that we are on a clear downtrend, but the same amount of people are claiming that we will have our reversal soon. 

This article tries to sum up all important information you have to need! 

1: Retracement of a parabolic uptrend: 
There is a rule of thumb for the retracement of a parabolic uptrend. We should retrace to approx. the 0.786  Fibonacci Retracement  +/- 10%! 
Depending where we start the count, we are already in that target. Although both ways (blue and red) have still some space for a further downwave! 







2: The bloody support of Bitcoin: 
The average cost of mining one  bitcoin -1.36%  are at USA/Russia approx. 4700$ and at 3100$ for china! 
A drop below a target of 4700$ would be savage. Nevertheless, i can't image that we will hit that target. 







3: Manipulation of  Bitcoin -1.36%  and the Bart Simpson Pattern: 
A friend of mine found some unusual patterns in the orderbooks of several exchanges: 
https://twitter.com/CryptoSyndrome 
Altcoins are manipulated on a daily basis. It seems that  bitcoin -1.36%  is now affected to this too, which causes all these 3-5% pump and dumps. 
Thus, we are forming all the time the Bartin Simpsons Patterns. 

4: Similarity to 2014: 
Bitcoin -1.36%  now: 






Bitcoin -1.36%  2014: 







5: Deminishing downtrend and a strong support 
If we see the falling  wedges  as the force of the downtrend, then the force is diminishing! 
Furthermore we have strong support which is holding now for the 4th time! 







6: The Indicators 
Having a look at the indicators at 2D, we have a good potential for an upwave now. 
The  volume  is deminishing which should indicate a breakout soon. 
The  MACD  is about to cross, the  RSI  was slightly overbought and is heading up like the  Stoch .  RSI . 
The 200  EMA  is slighty under the current price and act as a support. 

7: The symetrical Triangle 
The theory says, that we should have in a  sym -0.80% . triangle 5 times an  ABC  wave. The waves are not perfect, but we can construct them. 






As you can see, the last four ABC-Waves formed always a 1:1 extention, which indicates that we have finished wave 5. 

8: A possible Head and Shoulders 
Even if this is not the most perfect  Head and Shoulders  Pattern, it's still valid! 
We are currently at the neckline, which is a strong and important resistance. Breaking upwards should indicate a good uptrend. 







9: The magic  6th 0.00%  of the month 






Suprisingly we have on every  6th 0.00%  of the month a reversal. Why is that??? 
One reason could be the  CME Group Futures  with dates for the settlements always nearby the  6th 0.00%  of the month! 
http://www.cmegroup.com 

10: Longterm  Bullish  TA 
The whole pattern could be seen as a big  bullish pennant . 







11: Shortterm  Bullish  TA 
Leading diagonal  starting wave1 of an  Elliott Wave , since we have now an impulse wave, after the 5x  ABC  pattern inside the triangle is finished. 
Our target should be at the top of the triangle nearby 8600-8800$. 







12: Longterm  Bearish  TA 
We also can argue, that we are currenty in an downtrend and the  sym -0.80% . triangle just continuing the trend. 
Our target should be nearby 6000$ which is also a finished downwards  Elliott Wave .

Nothing is happening in the market:  volatility  has become extinct and coins' trading fallen out of fashion. Range-bound bots and robotic humans absolutely prosper in this environment. The price was unable to break the 7700 threshold. For me this is a  bearish  signal. Indicators provide mixed signals, so let's examine wave structure. The move from May 29 is a  3-wave -0.12%  correction within a larger downtrend. A price drop below 7500 would confirm this scenario.

					Impulse Wave Truncation (Truncated Fifth) - 
Truncated 5th wave is when the market has become so over-extended in Wave 3 that there is not much force left for the impulse wave to come to a proper completion. So when this happens, there is a chance that the last wave of the impulse, Wave 5, will not reach the end of Wave 3 before the market starts correcting in the opposite direction. At this point, the market is just too exhausted. This condition is often called a “failure” or a “Truncation.”

I can see many people still believe that we are going inside a  descending triangle . I also believed this in my idea that i shard on may 1st: 



 

Things can change so quickly and if we didn't adapt to the changes then someone will. That's why i believe that we have to be in fast adapt mode in this market. Doesn't mean that you need to change without checking yourself. I try to find 2-3 confirmations before i change my idea on something. This includes pattern changes, trend changes etc 

There are 21 corrective wave patterns in EW which is categorized into major 3 corrective wave patterns: 

Zigzag  (5-3-5) 
Flat (3-3-5) 
Triangle (3-3-3-3-3) 

And other patterns are combinations of the above which is:  

Double three (A combination of two corrective patterns above) 
Triple three (A combination of three corrective patterns above) 

So what i can see now is that we are in two double three combination corrective wave pattern: 








More info here:  

https://elliottwave-forecast.com/elliott-wave-theory/#corrective-waves 

Confirmations: 

1. Wave ((i)) of C is 1.6k and ((v)) is going to be completed below the triangle 
2. Wave (E) of the triangle can't go beyond the triangle.  
3. This has happened twice before in 2013 & 2015 

Each wave  got 3 subwaves (a,b &c) inside and we are in the subwave c of ((y)) of Y which is an impulsive wave. 

Impulsive waves: 1,3,5,a,c 
Corrective waves: 2,4,b 

Normal Fibo Ratios for these waves are: 

wave 2 = 0.5 - 0.8 of wave 1  
wave 3 = 1.236 - 1.618 of wave 1  
wave 4 = 0.5 - 0.618 of wave 3  
wave 5 = 0.618 - 1 of wave 1  
wave B = 0.5 - 0.8 of wave A  
wave C = 0.618 - 1.236 of wave A  

Now if you check what happened in subwave a of ((y)) of Y you can see that: 

Wave (i) of a: 985$ 
Wave (ii) of a: 434$  
Wave ( iii -0.48% ) of a: 1207$  
Wave (iv) of a: 691$ [~0.618 of Wave ( iii -0.48% )] 
Wave (v) of a: 950$  








I have seen  BTC -1.32%  impulsive waves fibo ratios almost the same as the previous impulsive wave fibo ratios. 
Now if you apply the same for the last wave C of (E) this is what you get: 

Wave ((i)) of c: 1587$ 
Wave ((ii)) of c  = 793$ 
Wave (( iii -0.48% )) of c  = 1961$ 
Wave ((iv)) of c [~0.618 of Wave (( iii -0.48% ))] = 1212$ 
Wave ((v)) of c  = 1587$ 








Also note that Wave ((iv)) might not retrace upto 0.618 of Wave (( iii -0.48% )) as everyone will be in panic mode by that time so minimum retracement would be around 0.386 of Wave (( iii -0.48% )) which is around 756$ and this is why i can see it goes down to 5k level or little bit more towards 4.7k which is the lowest level of the  support zone  (orange dotted lines) 








So 3 Possible Support lines for reversal would be 

1. Blue: 5800 - 6100 (Only possible if Wave ((v)) is truncated) 
2. Orange: 4700 - 5000 (This is most likely where we heading)  
3. Red: 4100 - 4400 (Only possible if Wave (( iii -0.48% )) is extended)

 Bitcoin -1.32%  has recently developed an interesting pattern of completing a  bullish  and  bearish  cycle on the sixth of every month in an alternating order. As we can see in the chart above, a fall is followed by a rise. This has happened twice before and is expected to happen again now on the  6th 0.00%  of June, 2018. This time  Bitcoin -1.32%  will finish a  bearish  cycle and I expected to begin the next  bullish  cycle at least till the end of  6th 0.00%  of July, 2018. 

This pattern of rise and fall is also supported by other patterns on the chart that signal a  bullish  reversal. The support line has also held firmly and if this pattern of alternating rise and fall ensues,  Bitcoin -1.32%  could very well make new highs by the end of the year. The  RSI  is recovering from oversold levels and has now approached a normal.  Bitcoin -1.32%  is currently at a favorable point for  bullish  entries. The price broke a long term resistance as it break past the downtrend line in April, 2018. This was a big accomplishment for the bulls but the lack of confidence pulled the price back to the support line. Currently, the price is just above the support line and appears to be all set for a  bullish  comeback but the reality is, there are not enough bulls in the market. 

The past few months have been devastating for the price of  Bitcoin -1.32%  ( BTC -1.32% ) and a lot of investors are still running scared. Institutional investors are looking for more clarity regarding regulations concerning cryptocurrencies and also safer ways to invest and store their coins. As for retail investors, most of them comprise of first time investors who have never traded any financial asset before. So, when they saw that  Bitcoin -1.32%  ( BTC -1.32% ) is making 20% gains every day, they thought this could go on forever and jumped with both feet, only to find the carpet pulled under from their feet. Big investors have always played small investors as cannon fodder and have gotten away with their schemes even in regulated markets like forex or the stock market. Cryptocurrencies is a new market with no proper regulations which means it is natural to expect that those who can afford to not play by the rules, most likely won’t.

Hello friends,  

It's been a while since my last post; lack of time and an urge to do more research has mainly driven me to take a break from posting ideas on TradingView. I am still in the process of doing more research and study, but I figure posting once in a while couldn't hurt. 

Since I have become recently very convinced about this, I am outlining a very possible situation with  Bitcoin -1.31%  where the  trend line  we have been on since early October breaks, reaching around a temporary low of $5000. This is examined on the  daily chart , since this is one of the best charts to examine trends of this size. I have to first and foremost say that I am not trying to spread fear, I know many people do not like to hear  bearish  ideas, but  technical analysis  is ultimately a rational exercise, and I feel that possibilities with very strong signs should be explored. 

There are a few things to look at, but I first want to talk about the big picture with, long-term  support and resistance  lines. I think most people can agree that there was a very significant downtrending resistance line that began from the peak of the  ATH 0.63%  in late December, to the low of around $6400 (thick red line). After the break from that line, it seems we moved into a sideways trend, bouncing back and forth between an emerging downtrending resistance line (light red) and a support line that we seem to have been respecting since mid-October (light green); at least this appears to be the case with the lows, where the angle's effectiveness appears very strongly. Finally, based on previous bounces, we can establish a support of around $5000-$5300 (I've thus created a small  support zone  around that range, in dark green), as well as lower supports around $3200 and $2000 (though I do not believe these will be reached, in dark green).   

Now, onto the analysis - it's no secret that  Bitcoin -1.31%  has been squeezing in, ready for a significant move either upwards or downwards. Initially I considered the upwards move to be more likely due to the significant media attention cryptocurrency has been receiving, but after viewing previous market cycles of  Bitcoin -1.31%  (check 2013), it seems clear to me that the  bearish  scenario of closing in on the market cycle is very likely, and should at the very least be prepared for with proper risk management. According to Dow Theory, which is said to have laid the foundations of modern  technical analysis , history repeats itself, and this is a situation where we forced to consider this. 

Should we break from the line, we will likely fall straight down to the $5000-$5000 area, where we will shoot back up and bounce towards around $6700 or so (maybe a little less). From there one, we will likely enter a sideways trend, which we will continue until we see higher highs and higher lows and parabolic movement returns, which could lead to us challenging the all-time high, and hitting $35k-$50k. 

NOTE: I seem to have reached the max character limit for this section of the idea, so I will continue my text below.

Comment:
					Onto the short-term: 


Scenario A: 

The reason why I have drawn this movement into a pennant is this way, is simply because we have been moving through this ascending triangle for quite a while now (May 23rd to today). I don't think that the pattern will be sufficient to directly lead into a strong sell-off, but we should consider that the size of ascending triangle suggests a small movement downwards at the very least, which can create a higher low, and thus move into position into a bearish pennant. Why would a bearish pennant occur here and not have a bounce to $8500-$8700? The reason is in positioning - the huge downtrend (May 5th to May 26th) creates a very nice flagpole in which it hits around the $5000 area very perfectly, and thus I would not be surprised if this happens. 

Second reason: on the Stoch RSI indicator on the daily chart, it appears to be dangerously high, which would suggest it being oversold. For the most part, it seems to have called lows and highs, at least to some extent. This overdrawn movement may very well have increased the likelyhood of Bitcoin being oversold. This could suggest that this is the last step into a sharp downturn, but this does not preclude Situation B. Volume has also been steadily decreasing, but this is the case with any sort of consolidation, I believe. 

Finally, the lines I have drawn below the triangle are simply bounces that I think seem fairly reasonable. The length from to support to the lines correlate with the length of the flagpole, of course, though it may seem chopped off due to the huge line from the long-term support downwards. 


Scenario B: 

This is much simpler, Bitcoin hits the upper resistance line, bounces off, challenges the lower support line, and we potentially see a break, and the rest unfolds from there. 


----------------------------------------------------------------------- 


With all this being said, do not fear if you are hoping for more parabolic movement - this likely will not be the end, and will simply be the set up for a long, drawn out sideways movement until the first signs of bullish activity begin and we start all over again. If you are longing around here, please consider using risk management, prepare for every possibility. If you are shorting, the same applies. 

Please trade with care. I wish the best to all traders!

Comment:
					This really is a very minor note, but I just want to emphasize that the rising wedge (which I erroneously refer to as an ascending triangle, a bad habit I have) entering a bearish pennant is more based on intuition than anything. Also, this pennant is mainly based on the conservative assumption that the break will happen at 7900, if it happens at 7700 where we seem to be general resistance, the pennant would look something like this:

I am Mid term-bullish on  BTC -1.31%  going into the end of this week, but looking to get into the market on a pull back to occur before I get in to the market.  The jury is still out as to whether this weekly bear trend is ready to turn around.  

We can see that both the  RSI  and  MFI  are both  Bullish  on the daily having bottomed when reaching oversold on both at c. $7k support where we found our longer term  trend line . 

We are currently in the process of meeting the Tenkan (blue line) as I write this, so in the very short term, I am looking for a pull back to $7550 range for an entry.  One of the main reasons for this is that on the 4hour timeframes we are close to completing an edge to edge trade so the risk reward doesn’t fit my profile, however a break out from the cloud or above the Tenkan around $7777 will make me enter the market. 

The  RSI  and  MFI  have both been excellent indicators in this bear market.  Whenever  RSI  has gone above the 60 and the  MFI  80; its time to exit the market from a  bullish  trade and consider shorting as it progresses higher.   

Based on the  RSI ,  MFI  trends and the fact that we will run into the Kijun at just around $8-8.2k, I will be scalling out at this  bearish  confluence level to start looking for pull backs and reassessment as i believe it to be a key point as  

Best case scenario this trade would yield a 10% return before leverage. 
This is for illustrative purposes only, please DYOR and goodluck with your trading.

So the pullback trade that we were looking at worked out & has made it's way back to the neckline level of structure. We are now at what i like to call a ""decision point"" Essentially IF price is able to violate this current level od structure THEN we're likely to continue to our next price projection.  

Something that a lot of newer traders don't understand is that when it comes to bigger moves, the market will often provide multiple opportunities to get involved. For those who don't rush and for those who don't get discouraged. If you perform consistent analysis you can often find multiple ways to involve yourself in a trade even if you missed the first strike.

This is the way markets move, If you question my charting check my previous posts. Its as simple as pie. We are going down, How long and how far is too soon to say. Here is a chart that we can understand the future price action and where to buy back. Before you guys start blasting my comment section with the time and how it may not be right thats correct. I am not calculating the time I'm just making a technical drawing of the directions that we will see in the next few months.  

Recent price action has clear signs of wash trading / market manipulation fud and lots of nonsense. Its hard to prove almost impossible so as a trader we just need to deal with it. Ideally the situation you are supposed to trade are critical break up and break down points to enter the trade. Dont enter or exit dumb trades and lose money. As an experienced trader you should be looking for shorts, I would not consider a long unless we are over $10-12k

I am never good with words so instead of writing paragraphs of clarification to justify my call for SHORT since my last posting, I have explained everything on my chart with the least words possible using Fibonacci. It does not matter how popular  Bitcoin -1.31%  has become, or how deep it has disrupted the financial sector, or how many institutional investors have come to invest in it -- the psychology behind a market cycle does not change. 

I don't really encourage anyone to short  Bitcoin -1.31% , but in all honesty, don't expect the bulls to fly anytime soon. Like I said before, this correction that we are having right now is the ""MOTHER OF ALL CORRECTIONS"" after a 4-year-long bull cycle since the 2013 correction... and we are just halfway through.

My best idea ever, taking some time off the last 2 days :) The whales just continue to play their little games by squeezing leveraged short and long positions out of the market. Can't play them, it's just too easy. Maybe it's time we retail traders stand together, combine our  volume  and use their own game against them. Yeah, maybe we could even make a blockbuster movie about this :) I love me some science fiction :) LOL  

My last update of the previous analysis i showed 2 important support levels where the price could bounce up from. The first support around 7350 did the trick and the price got pushed back to 7700. From that point on i told my members that i thought i was seeing distribution, but it was still very confusing to figure out what was going on. TA was showing  bullish  signs, that  bull flag  was very strong and was even turning slowly up and was about to squeeze upwards. But of course out of no where the price got dumped, the move we saw a few hours ago. After that 200 point drop the price got pushed up again to 7700 like that dump was a glitch. If your a whale, why not push out leveraged traders and take your money while your accumulating or distributing. It's like a bonus, like the cherry on top :)  

Anyway, in this chart we can see allot of similarities of what is going on. As you know i have been saying i am still  bearish  for the medium term, but i just could not say what was going to happen on the short term. 2 days ago after we finally dropped out of that  wedge , i said we would have 2 options.  
- Break those 2 support levels from the last update of my previous chart (73xx and 71xx) 
- Make a higher low at those same support levels and make another move up above the high.  
 
As we can see in the chart, the  fractal  is not 100% identical so it's no guarantee that the 7700 high we just saw is the high already and that we start to move down. But based on this  fractal , i don't want to see the price get above the 7800/7900. This  fractal  confirms my  bearish  view as well. That's why TA is so great, you can turn any chart to fit your view :). 

Even without this  fractal , i just give it a very small chance that 7K price action is the fundament of a low to start another bull rally, i just highly doubt that. I want to see more  volume  to begin with and at least  double bottom  kind of formation. So the minimum i expect is a test of the 7100/6900in the coming week or 2. But the movement i have in mind for the med term is a drop below the 7K to form a big V shape low. If we get to see that, than i might even become  bullish  for the rest of the year :).  

As long as the price stays above the 73xx, we have to assume the bulls are still in control and we should see another wave up. So for me the 73xx is an important turning point.

					At the moment it looks like bulls are trying to push higher, this bull flag/triangle is still very strong. So no sign of weakness yet! First small sign would be a drop below 7620/7600. Bulls need to break 7700

Comment:
					This is my bigger picture, think this bearish triangle is still 100% in play. I think if bulls can't break the 7800/7900 the bearish version is probably going to happen. Can't say HOW it will go, this blue line is just a guess. But a big V shape low would be the most bullish for the long term. I still think we are seeing distribution here. The only way this idea can be countered, is through a big increase of buying volume, if that doesn't happen, i think it's only a matter of time.

The price took a small dump but the volume was low so no real read on what the intent was. So we might see another move up, if we start to see a small pump that takes out the 7800, be aware of a fake breakout. The blue line is a possibility of what the move could look like IF we move up and if the breakout fails. If that happens than we will probably get confirmation if the price breaks the 7600ish. If we break the 7800 it should stay above the 7700 to confirm another move up. Not much more to say about what's going on.

397,1528359434.0,Taiwan_Bear,2618 (Double top & 0.618 pull-back) - do not miss it!!,"
In the last couple of TAs I have mentioned the “2618 pattern” and have been asked what 2618 means. Sorry for taking it so long as it took me quite a while to put everything altogether. But, as promised, I have explained below the rules and trade setups for the 2618 pattern.  

What are the rules/setups/steps for 2618?  
1.	Form a  double top  (Note #1)  
2.	Neckline has to be broken  
3.	After price found support at point (b), wait for pull back to 0.618 fib retracement of (a)(b)  
4.	After price retraced to 0.618, look for confluence and sell (eg. Structures,  trendlines  ,  double top  on a lower time frame,  rsi  divergence,  bearish pin bar  ,  inside bar  break down etc.) (Note #2)  
5.	Stop loss to be set above  double top 
6.	Set Take Profit levels (Note #3)  

Note #1 ( Double top ):  
The first step for the formation of 2618 is to form a  double top  at key resistance levels. Why at key resistance levels? Because we want to avoid fake double tops which can occur occasionally.  

There are some variations between various resources (books, websites) regarding the definitions of “double top”. The main differences occur where:  
a)	Some said for a  double top  to be valid, the wick of the 2nd top cannot exceed the wick of the 1st top; whereas, others said:  
b)	The wick of the 2nd top can exceed the wick of the 1st top but the candle close of the 2nd top CANNOT exceed the wick of the 1st top; or  
c)	The wick of the 2nd top can exceed the wick of the 1st top and the candle close of the 2nd top CAN exceed the wick of the 1st top; or  
d)	The wick of the 2nd top meets at least the candle close of the 1st top; or  
e)	The body of the 2nd top cannot exceed the body of the 1st top  

Personally, I would say all the above definitions work just fine although I do prefer definition a) because it means that the selling pressure is strong and the bulls fail to make a higher high. When there is a higher high formed in a downtrend, it can mean the downtrend has reversed and therefore you might not want to sell when the price pulls back to the 0.618 fib retracement.  

Note #2 ( 0.618 retracement ):  
When the price pulls back to 0.618, it does not mean to sell straight away. There must be more than one reason to sell other than the 0.618 retrace. The more reasons the better. In this example, you can see there are certainly structures (key resistance levels) at the 0.618 retrace. As well, there was a  double top  formed on the lower time frame. Consequently, you can sell.  

After  BTC -1.30%  hit the 0.618 retrace the first time, the price dropped from $9735 to $8650. but quickly bounced back to the 0.618 retrace level. That was a second & better opportunity to sell. Not only did  BTC -1.30%  form a  double top  on the larger time frame, but also with a  bearish  divergence on the 4hr time frame. Accordingly, you have more reasons to sell.  

Note #3 (Set take profit)  
Same as the rules of “Double top”, there are some variations as to which price level should you take profits. Personally, I would stick to the below:  
1)	First, take profit when risk/reward ratio hits 1:1 (recommend to take 30% - 50% profits and adjust the SL of the remaining positions to break-even)  
2)	When price hits the same price level as the low after the neckline is broken ((b) point in this example)  
3)	When price hits 1.272 fib extension of (a)(b)  
4)	When price hits point (d) (using  AB=CD  pattern. If you are not sure what the rules of  AB=CD  are, you can refer to my previous TA in which I have attached the link below)  
5)	If in a one-way market (heavily bearish/bullish), you can always keep 10% to 20% of your positions and take profits when risk/reward ratio hits 1:5 or even 1:10

 BTC -1.30%  is on the verge of breaking to a daily higher high on the bounce if the bulls can see a push this morning. 
If we reject from here the daily will form a lower high and we will see a tightening pattern within the highlighted  support and resistance  lines.  
Important for the bulls to show up or we could stay in this range into tomorrow.  
Healthy consolidation after the most recent bull move and the 15 min chart needs to change the trend.  
Also look to  EMA  12 support on the 4 hour and hourly.  
Another morning like yesterday with the bulls comfortable as worst case, we likely stay in the tightening pattern if bulls cannot prove themselves.

The current situation of  Bitcoin -1.30%  is quite difficult. We are on a clear treshold. A lot of traders are saying that we are on a clear downtrend, but the same amount of people are claiming that we will have our reversal soon. 

This article tries to sum up all important information you have to need! 

1: Retracement of a parabolic uptrend: 
There is a rule of thumb for the retracement of a parabolic uptrend. We should retrace to approx. the 0.786  Fibonacci Retracement  +/- 10%! 
Depending where we start the count, we are already in that target. Although both ways (blue and red) have still some space for a further downwave! 







2: The bloody support of Bitcoin: 
The average cost of mining one  bitcoin -1.30%  are at USA/Russia approx. 4700$ and at 3100$ for china! 
A drop below a target of 4700$ would be savage. Nevertheless, i can't image that we will hit that target. 







3: Manipulation of  Bitcoin -1.30%  and the Bart Simpson Pattern: 
A friend of mine found some unusual patterns in the orderbooks of several exchanges: 
https://twitter.com/CryptoSyndrome 
Altcoins are manipulated on a daily basis. It seems that  bitcoin -1.30%  is now affected to this too, which causes all these 3-5% pump and dumps. 
Thus, we are forming all the time the Bartin Simpsons Patterns. 

4: Similarity to 2014: 
Bitcoin -1.30%  now: 






Bitcoin -1.30%  2014: 







5: Deminishing downtrend and a strong support 
If we see the falling  wedges  as the force of the downtrend, then the force is diminishing! 
Furthermore we have strong support which is holding now for the 4th time! 







6: The Indicators 
Having a look at the indicators at 2D, we have a good potential for an upwave now. 
The  volume  is deminishing which should indicate a breakout soon. 
The  MACD  is about to cross, the  RSI  was slightly overbought and is heading up like the  Stoch .  RSI . 
The 200  EMA  is slighty under the current price and act as a support. 

7: The symetrical Triangle 
The theory says, that we should have in a  sym -1.72% . triangle 5 times an  ABC  wave. The waves are not perfect, but we can construct them. 






As you can see, the last four ABC-Waves formed always a 1:1 extention, which indicates that we have finished wave 5. 

8: A possible Head and Shoulders 
Even if this is not the most perfect  Head and Shoulders  Pattern, it's still valid! 
We are currently at the neckline, which is a strong and important resistance. Breaking upwards should indicate a good uptrend. 







9: The magic  6th 0.00%  of the month 






Suprisingly we have on every  6th 0.00%  of the month a reversal. Why is that??? 
One reason could be the  CME Group Futures  with dates for the settlements always nearby the  6th 0.00%  of the month! 
http://www.cmegroup.com 

10: Longterm  Bullish  TA 
The whole pattern could be seen as a big  bullish pennant . 







11: Shortterm  Bullish  TA 
Leading diagonal  starting wave1 of an  Elliott Wave , since we have now an impulse wave, after the 5x  ABC  pattern inside the triangle is finished. 
Our target should be at the top of the triangle nearby 8600-8800$. 







12: Longterm  Bearish  TA 
We also can argue, that we are currenty in an downtrend and the  sym -1.72% . triangle just continuing the trend. 
Our target should be nearby 6000$ which is also a finished downwards  Elliott Wave .

Nothing is happening in the market:  volatility  has become extinct and coins' trading fallen out of fashion. Range-bound bots and robotic humans absolutely prosper in this environment. The price was unable to break the 7700 threshold. For me this is a  bearish  signal. Indicators provide mixed signals, so let's examine wave structure. The move from May 29 is a  3-wave -0.12%  correction within a larger downtrend. A price drop below 7500 would confirm this scenario.

					Impulse Wave Truncation (Truncated Fifth) - 
Truncated 5th wave is when the market has become so over-extended in Wave 3 that there is not much force left for the impulse wave to come to a proper completion. So when this happens, there is a chance that the last wave of the impulse, Wave 5, will not reach the end of Wave 3 before the market starts correcting in the opposite direction. At this point, the market is just too exhausted. This condition is often called a “failure” or a “Truncation.”

I can see many people still believe that we are going inside a  descending triangle . I also believed this in my idea that i shard on may 1st: 



 

Things can change so quickly and if we didn't adapt to the changes then someone will. That's why i believe that we have to be in fast adapt mode in this market. Doesn't mean that you need to change without checking yourself. I try to find 2-3 confirmations before i change my idea on something. This includes pattern changes, trend changes etc 

There are 21 corrective wave patterns in EW which is categorized into major 3 corrective wave patterns: 

Zigzag  (5-3-5) 
Flat (3-3-5) 
Triangle (3-3-3-3-3) 

And other patterns are combinations of the above which is:  

Double three (A combination of two corrective patterns above) 
Triple three (A combination of three corrective patterns above) 

So what i can see now is that we are in two double three combination corrective wave pattern: 








More info here:  

https://elliottwave-forecast.com/elliott-wave-theory/#corrective-waves 

Confirmations: 

1. Wave ((i)) of C is 1.6k and ((v)) is going to be completed below the triangle 
2. Wave (E) of the triangle can't go beyond the triangle.  
3. This has happened twice before in 2013 & 2015 

Each wave  got 3 subwaves (a,b &c) inside and we are in the subwave c of ((y)) of Y which is an impulsive wave. 

Impulsive waves: 1,3,5,a,c 
Corrective waves: 2,4,b 

Normal Fibo Ratios for these waves are: 

wave 2 = 0.5 - 0.8 of wave 1  
wave 3 = 1.236 - 1.618 of wave 1  
wave 4 = 0.5 - 0.618 of wave 3  
wave 5 = 0.618 - 1 of wave 1  
wave B = 0.5 - 0.8 of wave A  
wave C = 0.618 - 1.236 of wave A  

Now if you check what happened in subwave a of ((y)) of Y you can see that: 

Wave (i) of a: 985$ 
Wave (ii) of a: 434$  
Wave ( iii -0.44% ) of a: 1207$  
Wave (iv) of a: 691$ [~0.618 of Wave ( iii -0.44% )] 
Wave (v) of a: 950$  








I have seen  BTC -1.30%  impulsive waves fibo ratios almost the same as the previous impulsive wave fibo ratios. 
Now if you apply the same for the last wave C of (E) this is what you get: 

Wave ((i)) of c: 1587$ 
Wave ((ii)) of c  = 793$ 
Wave (( iii -0.44% )) of c  = 1961$ 
Wave ((iv)) of c [~0.618 of Wave (( iii -0.44% ))] = 1212$ 
Wave ((v)) of c  = 1587$ 








Also note that Wave ((iv)) might not retrace upto 0.618 of Wave (( iii -0.44% )) as everyone will be in panic mode by that time so minimum retracement would be around 0.386 of Wave (( iii -0.44% )) which is around 756$ and this is why i can see it goes down to 5k level or little bit more towards 4.7k which is the lowest level of the  support zone  (orange dotted lines) 








So 3 Possible Support lines for reversal would be 

1. Blue: 5800 - 6100 (Only possible if Wave ((v)) is truncated) 
2. Orange: 4700 - 5000 (This is most likely where we heading)  
3. Red: 4100 - 4400 (Only possible if Wave (( iii -0.44% )) is extended)

 Bitcoin -1.30%  has recently developed an interesting pattern of completing a  bullish  and  bearish  cycle on the sixth of every month in an alternating order. As we can see in the chart above, a fall is followed by a rise. This has happened twice before and is expected to happen again now on the  6th 0.00%  of June, 2018. This time  Bitcoin -1.30%  will finish a  bearish  cycle and I expected to begin the next  bullish  cycle at least till the end of  6th 0.00%  of July, 2018. 

This pattern of rise and fall is also supported by other patterns on the chart that signal a  bullish  reversal. The support line has also held firmly and if this pattern of alternating rise and fall ensues,  Bitcoin -1.30%  could very well make new highs by the end of the year. The  RSI  is recovering from oversold levels and has now approached a normal.  Bitcoin -1.30%  is currently at a favorable point for  bullish  entries. The price broke a long term resistance as it break past the downtrend line in April, 2018. This was a big accomplishment for the bulls but the lack of confidence pulled the price back to the support line. Currently, the price is just above the support line and appears to be all set for a  bullish  comeback but the reality is, there are not enough bulls in the market. 

The past few months have been devastating for the price of  Bitcoin -1.30%  ( BTC -1.30% ) and a lot of investors are still running scared. Institutional investors are looking for more clarity regarding regulations concerning cryptocurrencies and also safer ways to invest and store their coins. As for retail investors, most of them comprise of first time investors who have never traded any financial asset before. So, when they saw that  Bitcoin -1.30%  ( BTC -1.30% ) is making 20% gains every day, they thought this could go on forever and jumped with both feet, only to find the carpet pulled under from their feet. Big investors have always played small investors as cannon fodder and have gotten away with their schemes even in regulated markets like forex or the stock market. Cryptocurrencies is a new market with no proper regulations which means it is natural to expect that those who can afford to not play by the rules, most likely won’t.

Hello friends,  

It's been a while since my last post; lack of time and an urge to do more research has mainly driven me to take a break from posting ideas on TradingView. I am still in the process of doing more research and study, but I figure posting once in a while couldn't hurt. 

Since I have become recently very convinced about this, I am outlining a very possible situation with  Bitcoin -1.30%  where the  trend line  we have been on since early October breaks, reaching around a temporary low of $5000. This is examined on the  daily chart , since this is one of the best charts to examine trends of this size. I have to first and foremost say that I am not trying to spread fear, I know many people do not like to hear  bearish  ideas, but  technical analysis  is ultimately a rational exercise, and I feel that possibilities with very strong signs should be explored. 

There are a few things to look at, but I first want to talk about the big picture with, long-term  support and resistance  lines. I think most people can agree that there was a very significant downtrending resistance line that began from the peak of the  ATH 0.63%  in late December, to the low of around $6400 (thick red line). After the break from that line, it seems we moved into a sideways trend, bouncing back and forth between an emerging downtrending resistance line (light red) and a support line that we seem to have been respecting since mid-October (light green); at least this appears to be the case with the lows, where the angle's effectiveness appears very strongly. Finally, based on previous bounces, we can establish a support of around $5000-$5300 (I've thus created a small  support zone  around that range, in dark green), as well as lower supports around $3200 and $2000 (though I do not believe these will be reached, in dark green).   

Now, onto the analysis - it's no secret that  Bitcoin -1.30%  has been squeezing in, ready for a significant move either upwards or downwards. Initially I considered the upwards move to be more likely due to the significant media attention cryptocurrency has been receiving, but after viewing previous market cycles of  Bitcoin -1.30%  (check 2013), it seems clear to me that the  bearish  scenario of closing in on the market cycle is very likely, and should at the very least be prepared for with proper risk management. According to Dow Theory, which is said to have laid the foundations of modern  technical analysis , history repeats itself, and this is a situation where we forced to consider this. 

Should we break from the line, we will likely fall straight down to the $5000-$5000 area, where we will shoot back up and bounce towards around $6700 or so (maybe a little less). From there one, we will likely enter a sideways trend, which we will continue until we see higher highs and higher lows and parabolic movement returns, which could lead to us challenging the all-time high, and hitting $35k-$50k. 

NOTE: I seem to have reached the max character limit for this section of the idea, so I will continue my text below.

Comment:
					Onto the short-term: 


Scenario A: 

The reason why I have drawn this movement into a pennant is this way, is simply because we have been moving through this ascending triangle for quite a while now (May 23rd to today). I don't think that the pattern will be sufficient to directly lead into a strong sell-off, but we should consider that the size of ascending triangle suggests a small movement downwards at the very least, which can create a higher low, and thus move into position into a bearish pennant. Why would a bearish pennant occur here and not have a bounce to $8500-$8700? The reason is in positioning - the huge downtrend (May 5th to May 26th) creates a very nice flagpole in which it hits around the $5000 area very perfectly, and thus I would not be surprised if this happens. 

Second reason: on the Stoch RSI indicator on the daily chart, it appears to be dangerously high, which would suggest it being oversold. For the most part, it seems to have called lows and highs, at least to some extent. This overdrawn movement may very well have increased the likelyhood of Bitcoin being oversold. This could suggest that this is the last step into a sharp downturn, but this does not preclude Situation B. Volume has also been steadily decreasing, but this is the case with any sort of consolidation, I believe. 

Finally, the lines I have drawn below the triangle are simply bounces that I think seem fairly reasonable. The length from to support to the lines correlate with the length of the flagpole, of course, though it may seem chopped off due to the huge line from the long-term support downwards. 


Scenario B: 

This is much simpler, Bitcoin hits the upper resistance line, bounces off, challenges the lower support line, and we potentially see a break, and the rest unfolds from there. 


----------------------------------------------------------------------- 


With all this being said, do not fear if you are hoping for more parabolic movement - this likely will not be the end, and will simply be the set up for a long, drawn out sideways movement until the first signs of bullish activity begin and we start all over again. If you are longing around here, please consider using risk management, prepare for every possibility. If you are shorting, the same applies. 

Please trade with care. I wish the best to all traders!

Comment:
					This really is a very minor note, but I just want to emphasize that the rising wedge (which I erroneously refer to as an ascending triangle, a bad habit I have) entering a bearish pennant is more based on intuition than anything. Also, this pennant is mainly based on the conservative assumption that the break will happen at 7900, if it happens at 7700 where we seem to be general resistance, the pennant would look something like this:

Jun 7




I am Mid term-bullish on  BTC -1.30%  going into the end of this week, but looking to get into the market on a pull back to occur before I get in to the market.  The jury is still out as to whether this weekly bear trend is ready to turn around.  

We can see that both the  RSI  and  MFI  are both  Bullish  on the daily having bottomed when reaching oversold on both at c. $7k support where we found our longer term  trend line . 

We are currently in the process of meeting the Tenkan (blue line) as I write this, so in the very short term, I am looking for a pull back to $7550 range for an entry.  One of the main reasons for this is that on the 4hour timeframes we are close to completing an edge to edge trade so the risk reward doesn’t fit my profile, however a break out from the cloud or above the Tenkan around $7777 will make me enter the market. 

The  RSI  and  MFI  have both been excellent indicators in this bear market.  Whenever  RSI  has gone above the 60 and the  MFI  80; its time to exit the market from a  bullish  trade and consider shorting as it progresses higher.   

Based on the  RSI ,  MFI  trends and the fact that we will run into the Kijun at just around $8-8.2k, I will be scalling out at this  bearish  confluence level to start looking for pull backs and reassessment as i believe it to be a key point as  

Best case scenario this trade would yield a 10% return before leverage. 
This is for illustrative purposes only, please DYOR and goodluck with your trading.

So the pullback trade that we were looking at worked out & has made it's way back to the neckline level of structure. We are now at what i like to call a ""decision point"" Essentially IF price is able to violate this current level od structure THEN we're likely to continue to our next price projection.  

Something that a lot of newer traders don't understand is that when it comes to bigger moves, the market will often provide multiple opportunities to get involved. For those who don't rush and for those who don't get discouraged. If you perform consistent analysis you can often find multiple ways to involve yourself in a trade even if you missed the first strike.

Recent price action has clear signs of wash trading / market manipulation fud and lots of nonsense. Its hard to prove almost impossible so as a trader we just need to deal with it. Ideally the situation you are supposed to trade are critical break up and break down points to enter the trade. Dont enter or exit dumb trades and lose money.

My best idea ever, taking some time off the last 2 days :) The whales just continue to play their little games by squeezing leveraged short and long positions out of the market. Can't play them, it's just too easy. Maybe it's time we retail traders stand together, combine our  volume  and use their own game against them. Yeah, maybe we could even make a blockbuster movie about this :) I love me some science fiction :) LOL  

My last update of the previous analysis i showed 2 important support levels where the price could bounce up from. The first support around 7350 did the trick and the price got pushed back to 7700. From that point on i told my members that i thought i was seeing distribution, but it was still very confusing to figure out what was going on. TA was showing  bullish  signs, that  bull flag  was very strong and was even turning slowly up and was about to squeeze upwards. But of course out of no where the price got dumped, the move we saw a few hours ago. After that 200 point drop the price got pushed up again to 7700 like that dump was a glitch. If your a whale, why not push out leveraged traders and take your money while your accumulating or distributing. It's like a bonus, like the cherry on top :)  

Anyway, in this chart we can see allot of similarities of what is going on. As you know i have been saying i am still  bearish  for the medium term, but i just could not say what was going to happen on the short term. 2 days ago after we finally dropped out of that  wedge , i said we would have 2 options.  
- Break those 2 support levels from the last update of my previous chart (73xx and 71xx) 
- Make a higher low at those same support levels and make another move up above the high.  
 
As we can see in the chart, the  fractal  is not 100% identical so it's no guarantee that the 7700 high we just saw is the high already and that we start to move down. But based on this  fractal , i don't want to see the price get above the 7800/7900. This  fractal  confirms my  bearish  view as well. That's why TA is so great, you can turn any chart to fit your view :). 

Even without this  fractal , i just give it a very small chance that 7K price action is the fundament of a low to start another bull rally, i just highly doubt that. I want to see more  volume  to begin with and at least  double bottom  kind of formation. So the minimum i expect is a test of the 7100/6900in the coming week or 2. But the movement i have in mind for the med term is a drop below the 7K to form a big V shape low. If we get to see that, than i might even become  bullish  for the rest of the year :).  

As long as the price stays above the 73xx, we have to assume the bulls are still in control and we should see another wave up. So for me the 73xx is an important turning point.

					At the moment it looks like bulls are trying to push higher, this bull flag/triangle is still very strong. So no sign of weakness yet! First small sign would be a drop below 7620/7600. Bulls need to break 7700

					This is my bigger picture, think this bearish triangle is still 100% in play. I think if bulls can't break the 7800/7900 the bearish version is probably going to happen. Can't say HOW it will go, this blue line is just a guess. But a big V shape low would be the most bullish for the long term. I still think we are seeing distribution here. The only way this idea can be countered, is through a big increase of buying volume, if that doesn't happen, i think it's only a matter of time.

					Lower time frame we can see a new upwards channel and maybe even a rising wedge. From the looks of it, it's slowly going down to test the support line again. Depending on what will happen there we can make a better prediction for the rest of the day.

					What a surprise, nothing has changed :) 

The price took a small dump but the volume was low so no real read on what the intent was. So we might see another move up, if we start to see a small pump that takes out the 7800, be aware of a fake breakout. The blue line is a possibility of what the move could look like IF we move up and if the breakout fails. If that happens than we will probably get confirmation if the price breaks the 7600ish. If we break the 7800 it should stay above the 7700 to confirm another move up. Not much more to say about what's going on.

In the last couple of TAs I have mentioned the “2618 pattern” and have been asked what 2618 means. Sorry for taking it so long as it took me quite a while to put everything altogether. But, as promised, I have explained below the rules and trade setups for the 2618 pattern.  

What are the rules/setups/steps for 2618?  
1.	Form a  double top  (Note #1)  
2.	Neckline has to be broken  
3.	After price found support at point (b), wait for pull back to 0.618 fib retracement of (a)(b)  
4.	After price retraced to 0.618, look for confluence and sell (eg. Structures,  trendlines  ,  double top  on a lower time frame,  rsi  divergence,  bearish pin bar  ,  inside bar  break down etc.) (Note #2)  
5.	Stop loss to be set above  double top 
6.	Set Take Profit levels (Note #3)  

Note #1 ( Double top ):  
The first step for the formation of 2618 is to form a  double top  at key resistance levels. Why at key resistance levels? Because we want to avoid fake double tops which can occur occasionally.  

There are some variations between various resources (books, websites) regarding the definitions of “double top”. The main differences occur where:  
a)	Some said for a  double top  to be valid, the wick of the 2nd top cannot exceed the wick of the 1st top; whereas, others said:  
b)	The wick of the 2nd top can exceed the wick of the 1st top but the candle close of the 2nd top CANNOT exceed the wick of the 1st top; or  
c)	The wick of the 2nd top can exceed the wick of the 1st top and the candle close of the 2nd top CAN exceed the wick of the 1st top; or  
d)	The wick of the 2nd top meets at least the candle close of the 1st top; or  
e)	The body of the 2nd top cannot exceed the body of the 1st top  

Personally, I would say all the above definitions work just fine although I do prefer definition a) because it means that the selling pressure is strong and the bulls fail to make a higher high. When there is a higher high formed in a downtrend, it can mean the downtrend has reversed and therefore you might not want to sell when the price pulls back to the 0.618 fib retracement.  

Note #2 ( 0.618 retracement ):  
When the price pulls back to 0.618, it does not mean to sell straight away. There must be more than one reason to sell other than the 0.618 retrace. The more reasons the better. In this example, you can see there are certainly structures (key resistance levels) at the 0.618 retrace. As well, there was a  double top  formed on the lower time frame. Consequently, you can sell.  

After  BTC -1.30%  hit the 0.618 retrace the first time, the price dropped from $9735 to $8650. but quickly bounced back to the 0.618 retrace level. That was a second & better opportunity to sell. Not only did  BTC -1.30%  form a  double top  on the larger time frame, but also with a  bearish  divergence on the 4hr time frame. Accordingly, you have more reasons to sell.  

Note #3 (Set take profit)  
Same as the rules of “Double top”, there are some variations as to which price level should you take profits. Personally, I would stick to the below:  
1)	First, take profit when risk/reward ratio hits 1:1 (recommend to take 30% - 50% profits and adjust the SL of the remaining positions to break-even)  
2)	When price hits the same price level as the low after the neckline is broken ((b) point in this example)  
3)	When price hits 1.272 fib extension of (a)(b)  
4)	When price hits point (d) (using  AB=CD  pattern. If you are not sure what the rules of  AB=CD  are, you can refer to my previous TA in which I have attached the link below)  
5)	If in a one-way market (heavily bearish/bullish), you can always keep 10% to 20% of your positions and take profits when risk/reward ratio hits 1:5 or even 1:10

 BTC -1.30%  is on the verge of breaking to a daily higher high on the bounce if the bulls can see a push this morning. 
If we reject from here the daily will form a lower high and we will see a tightening pattern within the highlighted  support and resistance  lines.  
Important for the bulls to show up or we could stay in this range into tomorrow.  
Healthy consolidation after the most recent bull move and the 15 min chart needs to change the trend.  
Also look to  EMA  12 support on the 4 hour and hourly.  
Another morning like yesterday with the bulls comfortable as worst case, we likely stay in the tightening pattern if bulls cannot prove themselves.

The current situation of  Bitcoin -1.30%  is quite difficult. We are on a clear treshold. A lot of traders are saying that we are on a clear downtrend, but the same amount of people are claiming that we will have our reversal soon. 

This article tries to sum up all important information you have to need! 

1: Retracement of a parabolic uptrend: 
There is a rule of thumb for the retracement of a parabolic uptrend. We should retrace to approx. the 0.786  Fibonacci Retracement  +/- 10%! 
Depending where we start the count, we are already in that target. Although both ways (blue and red) have still some space for a further downwave! 







2: The bloody support of Bitcoin: 
The average cost of mining one  bitcoin -1.30%  are at USA/Russia approx. 4700$ and at 3100$ for china! 
A drop below a target of 4700$ would be savage. Nevertheless, i can't image that we will hit that target. 







3: Manipulation of  Bitcoin -1.30%  and the Bart Simpson Pattern: 
A friend of mine found some unusual patterns in the orderbooks of several exchanges: 
https://twitter.com/CryptoSyndrome 
Altcoins are manipulated on a daily basis. It seems that  bitcoin -1.30%  is now affected to this too, which causes all these 3-5% pump and dumps. 
Thus, we are forming all the time the Bartin Simpsons Patterns. 

4: Similarity to 2014: 
Bitcoin -1.30%  now: 






Bitcoin -1.30%  2014: 







5: Deminishing downtrend and a strong support 
If we see the falling  wedges  as the force of the downtrend, then the force is diminishing! 
Furthermore we have strong support which is holding now for the 4th time! 







6: The Indicators 
Having a look at the indicators at 2D, we have a good potential for an upwave now. 
The  volume  is deminishing which should indicate a breakout soon. 
The  MACD  is about to cross, the  RSI  was slightly overbought and is heading up like the  Stoch .  RSI . 
The 200  EMA  is slighty under the current price and act as a support. 

7: The symetrical Triangle 
The theory says, that we should have in a  sym -1.72% . triangle 5 times an  ABC  wave. The waves are not perfect, but we can construct them. 






As you can see, the last four ABC-Waves formed always a 1:1 extention, which indicates that we have finished wave 5. 

8: A possible Head and Shoulders 
Even if this is not the most perfect  Head and Shoulders  Pattern, it's still valid! 
We are currently at the neckline, which is a strong and important resistance. Breaking upwards should indicate a good uptrend. 







9: The magic  6th 0.00%  of the month 






Suprisingly we have on every  6th 0.00%  of the month a reversal. Why is that??? 
One reason could be the  CME Group Futures  with dates for the settlements always nearby the  6th 0.00%  of the month! 
http://www.cmegroup.com 

10: Longterm  Bullish  TA 
The whole pattern could be seen as a big  bullish pennant . 







11: Shortterm  Bullish  TA 
Leading diagonal  starting wave1 of an  Elliott Wave , since we have now an impulse wave, after the 5x  ABC  pattern inside the triangle is finished. 
Our target should be at the top of the triangle nearby 8600-8800$. 







12: Longterm  Bearish  TA 
We also can argue, that we are currenty in an downtrend and the  sym -1.72% . triangle just continuing the trend. 
Our target should be nearby 6000$ which is also a finished downwards  Elliott Wave .

Nothing is happening in the market:  volatility  has become extinct and coins' trading fallen out of fashion. Range-bound bots and robotic humans absolutely prosper in this environment. The price was unable to break the 7700 threshold. For me this is a  bearish  signal. Indicators provide mixed signals, so let's examine wave structure. The move from May 29 is a  3-wave -0.12%  correction within a larger downtrend. A price drop below 7500 would confirm this scenario.

					Impulse Wave Truncation (Truncated Fifth) - 
Truncated 5th wave is when the market has become so over-extended in Wave 3 that there is not much force left for the impulse wave to come to a proper completion. So when this happens, there is a chance that the last wave of the impulse, Wave 5, will not reach the end of Wave 3 before the market starts correcting in the opposite direction. At this point, the market is just too exhausted. This condition is often called a “failure” or a “Truncation.”

I can see many people still believe that we are going inside a  descending triangle . I also believed this in my idea that i shard on may 1st: 



 

Things can change so quickly and if we didn't adapt to the changes then someone will. That's why i believe that we have to be in fast adapt mode in this market. Doesn't mean that you need to change without checking yourself. I try to find 2-3 confirmations before i change my idea on something. This includes pattern changes, trend changes etc 

There are 21 corrective wave patterns in EW which is categorized into major 3 corrective wave patterns: 

Zigzag  (5-3-5) 
Flat (3-3-5) 
Triangle (3-3-3-3-3) 

And other patterns are combinations of the above which is:  

Double three (A combination of two corrective patterns above) 
Triple three (A combination of three corrective patterns above) 

So what i can see now is that we are in two double three combination corrective wave pattern: 








More info here:  

https://elliottwave-forecast.com/elliott-wave-theory/#corrective-waves 

Confirmations: 

1. Wave ((i)) of C is 1.6k and ((v)) is going to be completed below the triangle 
2. Wave (E) of the triangle can't go beyond the triangle.  
3. This has happened twice before in 2013 & 2015 

Each wave  got 3 subwaves (a,b &c) inside and we are in the subwave c of ((y)) of Y which is an impulsive wave. 

Impulsive waves: 1,3,5,a,c 
Corrective waves: 2,4,b 

Normal Fibo Ratios for these waves are: 

wave 2 = 0.5 - 0.8 of wave 1  
wave 3 = 1.236 - 1.618 of wave 1  
wave 4 = 0.5 - 0.618 of wave 3  
wave 5 = 0.618 - 1 of wave 1  
wave B = 0.5 - 0.8 of wave A  
wave C = 0.618 - 1.236 of wave A  

Now if you check what happened in subwave a of ((y)) of Y you can see that: 

Wave (i) of a: 985$ 
Wave (ii) of a: 434$  
Wave ( iii -0.44% ) of a: 1207$  
Wave (iv) of a: 691$ [~0.618 of Wave ( iii -0.44% )] 
Wave (v) of a: 950$  








I have seen  BTC -1.32%  impulsive waves fibo ratios almost the same as the previous impulsive wave fibo ratios. 
Now if you apply the same for the last wave C of (E) this is what you get: 

Wave ((i)) of c: 1587$ 
Wave ((ii)) of c  = 793$ 
Wave (( iii -0.44% )) of c  = 1961$ 
Wave ((iv)) of c [~0.618 of Wave (( iii -0.44% ))] = 1212$ 
Wave ((v)) of c  = 1587$ 








Also note that Wave ((iv)) might not retrace upto 0.618 of Wave (( iii -0.44% )) as everyone will be in panic mode by that time so minimum retracement would be around 0.386 of Wave (( iii -0.44% )) which is around 756$ and this is why i can see it goes down to 5k level or little bit more towards 4.7k which is the lowest level of the  support zone  (orange dotted lines) 








So 3 Possible Support lines for reversal would be 

1. Blue: 5800 - 6100 (Only possible if Wave ((v)) is truncated) 
2. Orange: 4700 - 5000 (This is most likely where we heading)  
3. Red: 4100 - 4400 (Only possible if Wave (( iii -0.44% )) is extended)

 Bitcoin -1.35%  has recently developed an interesting pattern of completing a  bullish  and  bearish  cycle on the sixth of every month in an alternating order. As we can see in the chart above, a fall is followed by a rise. This has happened twice before and is expected to happen again now on the  6th 0.00%  of June, 2018. This time  Bitcoin -1.35%  will finish a  bearish  cycle and I expected to begin the next  bullish  cycle at least till the end of  6th 0.00%  of July, 2018. 

This pattern of rise and fall is also supported by other patterns on the chart that signal a  bullish  reversal. The support line has also held firmly and if this pattern of alternating rise and fall ensues,  Bitcoin -1.35%  could very well make new highs by the end of the year. The  RSI  is recovering from oversold levels and has now approached a normal.  Bitcoin -1.35%  is currently at a favorable point for  bullish  entries. The price broke a long term resistance as it break past the downtrend line in April, 2018. This was a big accomplishment for the bulls but the lack of confidence pulled the price back to the support line. Currently, the price is just above the support line and appears to be all set for a  bullish  comeback but the reality is, there are not enough bulls in the market. 

The past few months have been devastating for the price of  Bitcoin -1.35%  ( BTC -1.35% ) and a lot of investors are still running scared. Institutional investors are looking for more clarity regarding regulations concerning cryptocurrencies and also safer ways to invest and store their coins. As for retail investors, most of them comprise of first time investors who have never traded any financial asset before. So, when they saw that  Bitcoin -1.35%  ( BTC -1.35% ) is making 20% gains every day, they thought this could go on forever and jumped with both feet, only to find the carpet pulled under from their feet. Big investors have always played small investors as cannon fodder and have gotten away with their schemes even in regulated markets like forex or the stock market. Cryptocurrencies is a new market with no proper regulations which means it is natural to expect that those who can afford to not play by the rules, most likely won’t.

Hello friends,  

It's been a while since my last post; lack of time and an urge to do more research has mainly driven me to take a break from posting ideas on TradingView. I am still in the process of doing more research and study, but I figure posting once in a while couldn't hurt. 

Since I have become recently very convinced about this, I am outlining a very possible situation with  Bitcoin -1.37%  where the  trend line  we have been on since early October breaks, reaching around a temporary low of $5000. This is examined on the  daily chart , since this is one of the best charts to examine trends of this size. I have to first and foremost say that I am not trying to spread fear, I know many people do not like to hear  bearish  ideas, but  technical analysis  is ultimately a rational exercise, and I feel that possibilities with very strong signs should be explored. 

There are a few things to look at, but I first want to talk about the big picture with, long-term  support and resistance  lines. I think most people can agree that there was a very significant downtrending resistance line that began from the peak of the  ATH 0.63%  in late December, to the low of around $6400 (thick red line). After the break from that line, it seems we moved into a sideways trend, bouncing back and forth between an emerging downtrending resistance line (light red) and a support line that we seem to have been respecting since mid-October (light green); at least this appears to be the case with the lows, where the angle's effectiveness appears very strongly. Finally, based on previous bounces, we can establish a support of around $5000-$5300 (I've thus created a small  support zone  around that range, in dark green), as well as lower supports around $3200 and $2000 (though I do not believe these will be reached, in dark green).   

Now, onto the analysis - it's no secret that  Bitcoin -1.37%  has been squeezing in, ready for a significant move either upwards or downwards. Initially I considered the upwards move to be more likely due to the significant media attention cryptocurrency has been receiving, but after viewing previous market cycles of  Bitcoin -1.37%  (check 2013), it seems clear to me that the  bearish  scenario of closing in on the market cycle is very likely, and should at the very least be prepared for with proper risk management. According to Dow Theory, which is said to have laid the foundations of modern  technical analysis , history repeats itself, and this is a situation where we forced to consider this. 

Should we break from the line, we will likely fall straight down to the $5000-$5000 area, where we will shoot back up and bounce towards around $6700 or so (maybe a little less). From there one, we will likely enter a sideways trend, which we will continue until we see higher highs and higher lows and parabolic movement returns, which could lead to us challenging the all-time high, and hitting $35k-$50k. 

NOTE: I seem to have reached the max character limit for this section of the idea, so I will continue my text below.

Comment:
					Onto the short-term: 


Scenario A: 

The reason why I have drawn this movement into a pennant is this way, is simply because we have been moving through this ascending triangle for quite a while now (May 23rd to today). I don't think that the pattern will be sufficient to directly lead into a strong sell-off, but we should consider that the size of ascending triangle suggests a small movement downwards at the very least, which can create a higher low, and thus move into position into a bearish pennant. Why would a bearish pennant occur here and not have a bounce to $8500-$8700? The reason is in positioning - the huge downtrend (May 5th to May 26th) creates a very nice flagpole in which it hits around the $5000 area very perfectly, and thus I would not be surprised if this happens. 

Second reason: on the Stoch RSI indicator on the daily chart, it appears to be dangerously high, which would suggest it being oversold. For the most part, it seems to have called lows and highs, at least to some extent. This overdrawn movement may very well have increased the likelyhood of Bitcoin being oversold. This could suggest that this is the last step into a sharp downturn, but this does not preclude Situation B. Volume has also been steadily decreasing, but this is the case with any sort of consolidation, I believe. 

Finally, the lines I have drawn below the triangle are simply bounces that I think seem fairly reasonable. The length from to support to the lines correlate with the length of the flagpole, of course, though it may seem chopped off due to the huge line from the long-term support downwards. 


Scenario B: 

This is much simpler, Bitcoin hits the upper resistance line, bounces off, challenges the lower support line, and we potentially see a break, and the rest unfolds from there. 


----------------------------------------------------------------------- 


With all this being said, do not fear if you are hoping for more parabolic movement - this likely will not be the end, and will simply be the set up for a long, drawn out sideways movement until the first signs of bullish activity begin and we start all over again. If you are longing around here, please consider using risk management, prepare for every possibility. If you are shorting, the same applies. 

Please trade with care. I wish the best to all traders!

Comment:
					This really is a very minor note, but I just want to emphasize that the rising wedge (which I erroneously refer to as an ascending triangle, a bad habit I have) entering a bearish pennant is more based on intuition than anything. Also, this pennant is mainly based on the conservative assumption that the break will happen at 7900, if it happens at 7700 where we seem to be general resistance, the pennant would look something like this:

Jun 7




I am Mid term-bullish on  BTC -1.40%  going into the end of this week, but looking to get into the market on a pull back to occur before I get in to the market.  The jury is still out as to whether this weekly bear trend is ready to turn around.  

We can see that both the  RSI  and  MFI  are both  Bullish  on the daily having bottomed when reaching oversold on both at c. $7k support where we found our longer term  trend line . 

We are currently in the process of meeting the Tenkan (blue line) as I write this, so in the very short term, I am looking for a pull back to $7550 range for an entry.  One of the main reasons for this is that on the 4hour timeframes we are close to completing an edge to edge trade so the risk reward doesn’t fit my profile, however a break out from the cloud or above the Tenkan around $7777 will make me enter the market. 

The  RSI  and  MFI  have both been excellent indicators in this bear market.  Whenever  RSI  has gone above the 60 and the  MFI  80; its time to exit the market from a  bullish  trade and consider shorting as it progresses higher.   

Based on the  RSI ,  MFI  trends and the fact that we will run into the Kijun at just around $8-8.2k, I will be scalling out at this  bearish  confluence level to start looking for pull backs and reassessment as i believe it to be a key point as  

Best case scenario this trade would yield a 10% return before leverage. 
This is for illustrative purposes only, please DYOR and goodluck with your trading.

We are now at what i like to call a ""decision point"" Essentially IF price is able to violate this current level od structure THEN we're likely to continue to our next price projection.  

Something that a lot of newer traders don't understand is that when it comes to bigger moves, the market will often provide multiple opportunities to get involved. For those who don't rush and for those who don't get discouraged. If you perform consistent analysis you can often find multiple ways to involve yourself in a trade even if you missed the first strike.

This is the way markets move, If you question my charting check my previous posts. Its as simple as pie. We are going down, How long and how far is too soon to say. Here is a chart that we can understand the future price action and where to buy back. Before you guys start blasting my comment section with the time and how it may not be right thats correct. I am not calculating the time I'm just making a technical drawing of the directions that we will see in the next few months.  

Recent price action has clear signs of wash trading / market manipulation fud and lots of nonsense. Its hard to prove almost impossible so as a trader we just need to deal with it. Ideally the situation you are supposed to trade are critical break up and break down points to enter the trade. Dont enter or exit dumb trades and lose money. As an experienced trader you should be looking for shorts, I would not consider a long unless we are over $10-12k

I am never good with words so instead of writing paragraphs of clarification to justify my call for SHORT since my last posting, I have explained everything on my chart with the least words possible using Fibonacci. It does not matter how popular  Bitcoin -1.40%  has become, or how deep it has disrupted the financial sector, or how many institutional investors have come to invest in it -- the psychology behind a market cycle does not change. 

I don't really encourage anyone to short  Bitcoin -1.40% , but in all honesty, don't expect the bulls to fly anytime soon. Like I said before, this correction that we are having right now is the ""MOTHER OF ALL CORRECTIONS"" after a 4-year-long bull cycle since the 2013 correction... and we are just halfway through.

My best idea ever, taking some time off the last 2 days :) The whales just continue to play their little games by squeezing leveraged short and long positions out of the market. Can't play them, it's just too easy. Maybe it's time we retail traders stand together, combine our  volume  and use their own game against them. Yeah, maybe we could even make a blockbuster movie about this :) I love me some science fiction :) LOL  

My last update of the previous analysis i showed 2 important support levels where the price could bounce up from. The first support around 7350 did the trick and the price got pushed back to 7700. From that point on i told my members that i thought i was seeing distribution, but it was still very confusing to figure out what was going on. TA was showing  bullish  signs, that  bull flag  was very strong and was even turning slowly up and was about to squeeze upwards. But of course out of no where the price got dumped, the move we saw a few hours ago. After that 200 point drop the price got pushed up again to 7700 like that dump was a glitch. If your a whale, why not push out leveraged traders and take your money while your accumulating or distributing. It's like a bonus, like the cherry on top :)  

Anyway, in this chart we can see allot of similarities of what is going on. As you know i have been saying i am still  bearish  for the medium term, but i just could not say what was going to happen on the short term. 2 days ago after we finally dropped out of that  wedge , i said we would have 2 options.  
- Break those 2 support levels from the last update of my previous chart (73xx and 71xx) 
- Make a higher low at those same support levels and make another move up above the high.  
 
As we can see in the chart, the  fractal  is not 100% identical so it's no guarantee that the 7700 high we just saw is the high already and that we start to move down. But based on this  fractal , i don't want to see the price get above the 7800/7900. This  fractal  confirms my  bearish  view as well. That's why TA is so great, you can turn any chart to fit your view :). 

Even without this  fractal , i just give it a very small chance that 7K price action is the fundament of a low to start another bull rally, i just highly doubt that. I want to see more  volume  to begin with and at least  double bottom  kind of formation. So the minimum i expect is a test of the 7100/6900in the coming week or 2. But the movement i have in mind for the med term is a drop below the 7K to form a big V shape low. If we get to see that, than i might even become  bullish  for the rest of the year :).  

As long as the price stays above the 73xx, we have to assume the bulls are still in control and we should see another wave up. So for me the 73xx is an important turning point.

					At the moment it looks like bulls are trying to push higher, this bull flag/triangle is still very strong. So no sign of weakness yet! First small sign would be a drop below 7620/7600. Bulls need to break 7700

Comment:
					This is my bigger picture, think this bearish triangle is still 100% in play. I think if bulls can't break the 7800/7900 the bearish version is probably going to happen. Can't say HOW it will go, this blue line is just a guess. But a big V shape low would be the most bullish for the long term. I still think we are seeing distribution here. The only way this idea can be countered, is through a big increase of buying volume, if that doesn't happen, i think it's only a matter of time.

					Lower time frame we can see a new upwards channel and maybe even a rising wedge. From the looks of it, it's slowly going down to test the support line again. Depending on what will happen there we can make a better prediction for the rest of the day.

The price took a small dump but the volume was low so no real read on what the intent was. So we might see another move up, if we start to see a small pump that takes out the 7800, be aware of a fake breakout. The blue line is a possibility of what the move could look like IF we move up and if the breakout fails. If that happens than we will probably get confirmation if the price breaks the 7600ish. If we break the 7800 it should stay above the 7700 to confirm another move up. Not much more to say about what's going on.

433,1528359434.0,Taiwan_Bear,2618 (Double top & 0.618 pull-back) - do not miss it!!,"
In the last couple of TAs I have mentioned the “2618 pattern” and have been asked what 2618 means. Sorry for taking it so long as it took me quite a while to put everything altogether. But, as promised, I have explained below the rules and trade setups for the 2618 pattern.  

What are the rules/setups/steps for 2618?  
1.	Form a  double top  (Note #1)  
2.	Neckline has to be broken  
3.	After price found support at point (b), wait for pull back to 0.618 fib retracement of (a)(b)  
4.	After price retraced to 0.618, look for confluence and sell (eg. Structures,  trendlines  ,  double top  on a lower time frame,  rsi  divergence,  bearish pin bar  ,  inside bar  break down etc.) (Note #2)  
5.	Stop loss to be set above  double top 
6.	Set Take Profit levels (Note #3)  

Note #1 ( Double top ):  
The first step for the formation of 2618 is to form a  double top  at key resistance levels. Why at key resistance levels? Because we want to avoid fake double tops which can occur occasionally.  

There are some variations between various resources (books, websites) regarding the definitions of “double top”. The main differences occur where:  
a)	Some said for a  double top  to be valid, the wick of the 2nd top cannot exceed the wick of the 1st top; whereas, others said:  
b)	The wick of the 2nd top can exceed the wick of the 1st top but the candle close of the 2nd top CANNOT exceed the wick of the 1st top; or  
c)	The wick of the 2nd top can exceed the wick of the 1st top and the candle close of the 2nd top CAN exceed the wick of the 1st top; or  
d)	The wick of the 2nd top meets at least the candle close of the 1st top; or  
e)	The body of the 2nd top cannot exceed the body of the 1st top  

Personally, I would say all the above definitions work just fine although I do prefer definition a) because it means that the selling pressure is strong and the bulls fail to make a higher high. When there is a higher high formed in a downtrend, it can mean the downtrend has reversed and therefore you might not want to sell when the price pulls back to the 0.618 fib retracement.  

Note #2 ( 0.618 retracement ):  
When the price pulls back to 0.618, it does not mean to sell straight away. There must be more than one reason to sell other than the 0.618 retrace. The more reasons the better. In this example, you can see there are certainly structures (key resistance levels) at the 0.618 retrace. As well, there was a  double top  formed on the lower time frame. Consequently, you can sell.  

After  BTC -1.37%  hit the 0.618 retrace the first time, the price dropped from $9735 to $8650. but quickly bounced back to the 0.618 retrace level. That was a second & better opportunity to sell. Not only did  BTC -1.37%  form a  double top  on the larger time frame, but also with a  bearish  divergence on the 4hr time frame. Accordingly, you have more reasons to sell.  

Note #3 (Set take profit)  
Same as the rules of “Double top”, there are some variations as to which price level should you take profits. Personally, I would stick to the below:  
1)	First, take profit when risk/reward ratio hits 1:1 (recommend to take 30% - 50% profits and adjust the SL of the remaining positions to break-even)  
2)	When price hits the same price level as the low after the neckline is broken ((b) point in this example)  
3)	When price hits 1.272 fib extension of (a)(b)  
4)	When price hits point (d) (using  AB=CD  pattern. If you are not sure what the rules of  AB=CD  are, you can refer to my previous TA in which I have attached the link below)  
5)	If in a one-way market (heavily bearish/bullish), you can always keep 10% to 20% of your positions and take profits when risk/reward ratio hits 1:5 or even 1:10

 BTC -1.36%  is on the verge of breaking to a daily higher high on the bounce if the bulls can see a push this morning. 
If we reject from here the daily will form a lower high and we will see a tightening pattern within the highlighted  support and resistance  lines.  
Important for the bulls to show up or we could stay in this range into tomorrow.  
Healthy consolidation after the most recent bull move and the 15 min chart needs to change the trend.  
Also look to  EMA  12 support on the 4 hour and hourly.  
Another morning like yesterday with the bulls comfortable as worst case, we likely stay in the tightening pattern if bulls cannot prove themselves.

The current situation of  Bitcoin -1.37%  is quite difficult. We are on a clear treshold. A lot of traders are saying that we are on a clear downtrend, but the same amount of people are claiming that we will have our reversal soon. 

This article tries to sum up all important information you have to need! 

1: Retracement of a parabolic uptrend: 
There is a rule of thumb for the retracement of a parabolic uptrend. We should retrace to approx. the 0.786  Fibonacci Retracement  +/- 10%! 
Depending where we start the count, we are already in that target. Although both ways (blue and red) have still some space for a further downwave! 







2: The bloody support of Bitcoin: 
The average cost of mining one  bitcoin -1.37%  are at USA/Russia approx. 4700$ and at 3100$ for china! 
A drop below a target of 4700$ would be savage. Nevertheless, i can't image that we will hit that target. 







3: Manipulation of  Bitcoin -1.37%  and the Bart Simpson Pattern: 
A friend of mine found some unusual patterns in the orderbooks of several exchanges: 
https://twitter.com/CryptoSyndrome 
Altcoins are manipulated on a daily basis. It seems that  bitcoin -1.37%  is now affected to this too, which causes all these 3-5% pump and dumps. 
Thus, we are forming all the time the Bartin Simpsons Patterns. 

4: Similarity to 2014: 
Bitcoin -1.37%  now: 






Bitcoin -1.37%  2014: 







5: Deminishing downtrend and a strong support 
If we see the falling  wedges  as the force of the downtrend, then the force is diminishing! 
Furthermore we have strong support which is holding now for the 4th time! 







6: The Indicators 
Having a look at the indicators at 2D, we have a good potential for an upwave now. 
The  volume  is deminishing which should indicate a breakout soon. 
The  MACD  is about to cross, the  RSI  was slightly overbought and is heading up like the  Stoch .  RSI . 
The 200  EMA  is slighty under the current price and act as a support. 

7: The symetrical Triangle 
The theory says, that we should have in a  sym -1.72% . triangle 5 times an  ABC  wave. The waves are not perfect, but we can construct them. 






As you can see, the last four ABC-Waves formed always a 1:1 extention, which indicates that we have finished wave 5. 

8: A possible Head and Shoulders 
Even if this is not the most perfect  Head and Shoulders  Pattern, it's still valid! 
We are currently at the neckline, which is a strong and important resistance. Breaking upwards should indicate a good uptrend. 







9: The magic  6th 0.00%  of the month 






Suprisingly we have on every  6th 0.00%  of the month a reversal. Why is that??? 
One reason could be the  CME Group Futures  with dates for the settlements always nearby the  6th 0.00%  of the month! 
http://www.cmegroup.com 

10: Longterm  Bullish  TA 
The whole pattern could be seen as a big  bullish pennant . 







11: Shortterm  Bullish  TA 
Leading diagonal  starting wave1 of an  Elliott Wave , since we have now an impulse wave, after the 5x  ABC  pattern inside the triangle is finished. 
Our target should be at the top of the triangle nearby 8600-8800$. 







12: Longterm  Bearish  TA 
We also can argue, that we are currenty in an downtrend and the  sym -1.72% . triangle just continuing the trend. 
Our target should be nearby 6000$ which is also a finished downwards  Elliott Wave .

Nothing is happening in the market:  volatility  has become extinct and coins' trading fallen out of fashion. Range-bound bots and robotic humans absolutely prosper in this environment. The price was unable to break the 7700 threshold. For me this is a  bearish  signal. Indicators provide mixed signals, so let's examine wave structure. The move from May 29 is a  3-wave -0.12%  correction within a larger downtrend. A price drop below 7500 would confirm this scenario.

					Impulse Wave Truncation (Truncated Fifth) - 
Truncated 5th wave is when the market has become so over-extended in Wave 3 that there is not much force left for the impulse wave to come to a proper completion. So when this happens, there is a chance that the last wave of the impulse, Wave 5, will not reach the end of Wave 3 before the market starts correcting in the opposite direction. At this point, the market is just too exhausted. This condition is often called a “failure” or a “Truncation.”

I can see many people still believe that we are going inside a  descending triangle . I also believed this in my idea that i shard on may 1st: 



 

Things can change so quickly and if we didn't adapt to the changes then someone will. That's why i believe that we have to be in fast adapt mode in this market. Doesn't mean that you need to change without checking yourself. I try to find 2-3 confirmations before i change my idea on something. This includes pattern changes, trend changes etc 

There are 21 corrective wave patterns in EW which is categorized into major 3 corrective wave patterns: 

Zigzag  (5-3-5) 
Flat (3-3-5) 
Triangle (3-3-3-3-3) 

And other patterns are combinations of the above which is:  

Double three (A combination of two corrective patterns above) 
Triple three (A combination of three corrective patterns above) 

So what i can see now is that we are in two double three combination corrective wave pattern: 








More info here:  

https://elliottwave-forecast.com/elliott-wave-theory/#corrective-waves 

Confirmations: 

1. Wave ((i)) of C is 1.6k and ((v)) is going to be completed below the triangle 
2. Wave (E) of the triangle can't go beyond the triangle.  
3. This has happened twice before in 2013 & 2015 

Each wave  got 3 subwaves (a,b &c) inside and we are in the subwave c of ((y)) of Y which is an impulsive wave. 

Impulsive waves: 1,3,5,a,c 
Corrective waves: 2,4,b 

Normal Fibo Ratios for these waves are: 

wave 2 = 0.5 - 0.8 of wave 1  
wave 3 = 1.236 - 1.618 of wave 1  
wave 4 = 0.5 - 0.618 of wave 3  
wave 5 = 0.618 - 1 of wave 1  
wave B = 0.5 - 0.8 of wave A  
wave C = 0.618 - 1.236 of wave A  

Now if you check what happened in subwave a of ((y)) of Y you can see that: 

Wave (i) of a: 985$ 
Wave (ii) of a: 434$  
Wave ( iii -0.46% ) of a: 1207$  
Wave (iv) of a: 691$ [~0.618 of Wave ( iii -0.46% )] 
Wave (v) of a: 950$  








I have seen  BTC -1.40%  impulsive waves fibo ratios almost the same as the previous impulsive wave fibo ratios. 
Now if you apply the same for the last wave C of (E) this is what you get: 

Wave ((i)) of c: 1587$ 
Wave ((ii)) of c  = 793$ 
Wave (( iii -0.46% )) of c  = 1961$ 
Wave ((iv)) of c [~0.618 of Wave (( iii -0.46% ))] = 1212$ 
Wave ((v)) of c  = 1587$ 








Also note that Wave ((iv)) might not retrace upto 0.618 of Wave (( iii -0.46% )) as everyone will be in panic mode by that time so minimum retracement would be around 0.386 of Wave (( iii -0.46% )) which is around 756$ and this is why i can see it goes down to 5k level or little bit more towards 4.7k which is the lowest level of the  support zone  (orange dotted lines) 








So 3 Possible Support lines for reversal would be 

1. Blue: 5800 - 6100 (Only possible if Wave ((v)) is truncated) 
2. Orange: 4700 - 5000 (This is most likely where we heading)  
3. Red: 4100 - 4400 (Only possible if Wave (( iii -0.46% )) is extended)

 Bitcoin -1.40%  has recently developed an interesting pattern of completing a  bullish  and  bearish  cycle on the sixth of every month in an alternating order. As we can see in the chart above, a fall is followed by a rise. This has happened twice before and is expected to happen again now on the  6th 0.00%  of June, 2018. This time  Bitcoin -1.40%  will finish a  bearish  cycle and I expected to begin the next  bullish  cycle at least till the end of  6th 0.00%  of July, 2018. 

This pattern of rise and fall is also supported by other patterns on the chart that signal a  bullish  reversal. The support line has also held firmly and if this pattern of alternating rise and fall ensues,  Bitcoin -1.40%  could very well make new highs by the end of the year. The  RSI  is recovering from oversold levels and has now approached a normal.  Bitcoin -1.40%  is currently at a favorable point for  bullish  entries. The price broke a long term resistance as it break past the downtrend line in April, 2018. This was a big accomplishment for the bulls but the lack of confidence pulled the price back to the support line. Currently, the price is just above the support line and appears to be all set for a  bullish  comeback but the reality is, there are not enough bulls in the market. 

The past few months have been devastating for the price of  Bitcoin -1.40%  ( BTC -1.40% ) and a lot of investors are still running scared. Institutional investors are looking for more clarity regarding regulations concerning cryptocurrencies and also safer ways to invest and store their coins. As for retail investors, most of them comprise of first time investors who have never traded any financial asset before. So, when they saw that  Bitcoin -1.40%  ( BTC -1.40% ) is making 20% gains every day, they thought this could go on forever and jumped with both feet, only to find the carpet pulled under from their feet. Big investors have always played small investors as cannon fodder and have gotten away with their schemes even in regulated markets like forex or the stock market. Cryptocurrencies is a new market with no proper regulations which means it is natural to expect that those who can afford to not play by the rules, most likely won’t.

Hello friends,  

It's been a while since my last post; lack of time and an urge to do more research has mainly driven me to take a break from posting ideas on TradingView. I am still in the process of doing more research and study, but I figure posting once in a while couldn't hurt. 

Since I have become recently very convinced about this, I am outlining a very possible situation with  Bitcoin -1.40%  where the  trend line  we have been on since early October breaks, reaching around a temporary low of $5000. This is examined on the  daily chart , since this is one of the best charts to examine trends of this size. I have to first and foremost say that I am not trying to spread fear, I know many people do not like to hear  bearish  ideas, but  technical analysis  is ultimately a rational exercise, and I feel that possibilities with very strong signs should be explored. 

There are a few things to look at, but I first want to talk about the big picture with, long-term  support and resistance  lines. I think most people can agree that there was a very significant downtrending resistance line that began from the peak of the  ATH 0.63%  in late December, to the low of around $6400 (thick red line). After the break from that line, it seems we moved into a sideways trend, bouncing back and forth between an emerging downtrending resistance line (light red) and a support line that we seem to have been respecting since mid-October (light green); at least this appears to be the case with the lows, where the angle's effectiveness appears very strongly. Finally, based on previous bounces, we can establish a support of around $5000-$5300 (I've thus created a small  support zone  around that range, in dark green), as well as lower supports around $3200 and $2000 (though I do not believe these will be reached, in dark green).   

Now, onto the analysis - it's no secret that  Bitcoin -1.40%  has been squeezing in, ready for a significant move either upwards or downwards. Initially I considered the upwards move to be more likely due to the significant media attention cryptocurrency has been receiving, but after viewing previous market cycles of  Bitcoin -1.40%  (check 2013), it seems clear to me that the  bearish  scenario of closing in on the market cycle is very likely, and should at the very least be prepared for with proper risk management. According to Dow Theory, which is said to have laid the foundations of modern  technical analysis , history repeats itself, and this is a situation where we forced to consider this. 

Should we break from the line, we will likely fall straight down to the $5000-$5000 area, where we will shoot back up and bounce towards around $6700 or so (maybe a little less). From there one, we will likely enter a sideways trend, which we will continue until we see higher highs and higher lows and parabolic movement returns, which could lead to us challenging the all-time high, and hitting $35k-$50k. 

NOTE: I seem to have reached the max character limit for this section of the idea, so I will continue my text below.

Comment:
					Onto the short-term: 


Scenario A: 

The reason why I have drawn this movement into a pennant is this way, is simply because we have been moving through this ascending triangle for quite a while now (May 23rd to today). I don't think that the pattern will be sufficient to directly lead into a strong sell-off, but we should consider that the size of ascending triangle suggests a small movement downwards at the very least, which can create a higher low, and thus move into position into a bearish pennant. Why would a bearish pennant occur here and not have a bounce to $8500-$8700? The reason is in positioning - the huge downtrend (May 5th to May 26th) creates a very nice flagpole in which it hits around the $5000 area very perfectly, and thus I would not be surprised if this happens. 

Second reason: on the Stoch RSI indicator on the daily chart, it appears to be dangerously high, which would suggest it being oversold. For the most part, it seems to have called lows and highs, at least to some extent. This overdrawn movement may very well have increased the likelyhood of Bitcoin being oversold. This could suggest that this is the last step into a sharp downturn, but this does not preclude Situation B. Volume has also been steadily decreasing, but this is the case with any sort of consolidation, I believe. 

Finally, the lines I have drawn below the triangle are simply bounces that I think seem fairly reasonable. The length from to support to the lines correlate with the length of the flagpole, of course, though it may seem chopped off due to the huge line from the long-term support downwards. 


Scenario B: 

This is much simpler, Bitcoin hits the upper resistance line, bounces off, challenges the lower support line, and we potentially see a break, and the rest unfolds from there. 


----------------------------------------------------------------------- 


With all this being said, do not fear if you are hoping for more parabolic movement - this likely will not be the end, and will simply be the set up for a long, drawn out sideways movement until the first signs of bullish activity begin and we start all over again. If you are longing around here, please consider using risk management, prepare for every possibility. If you are shorting, the same applies. 

Please trade with care. I wish the best to all traders!

Comment:
					This really is a very minor note, but I just want to emphasize that the rising wedge (which I erroneously refer to as an ascending triangle, a bad habit I have) entering a bearish pennant is more based on intuition than anything. Also, this pennant is mainly based on the conservative assumption that the break will happen at 7900, if it happens at 7700 where we seem to be general resistance, the pennant would look something like this:

I am Mid term-bullish on  BTC -1.41%  going into the end of this week, but looking to get into the market on a pull back to occur before I get in to the market.  The jury is still out as to whether this weekly bear trend is ready to turn around.  

We can see that both the  RSI  and  MFI  are both  Bullish  on the daily having bottomed when reaching oversold on both at c. $7k support where we found our longer term  trend line . 

We are currently in the process of meeting the Tenkan (blue line) as I write this, so in the very short term, I am looking for a pull back to $7550 range for an entry.  One of the main reasons for this is that on the 4hour timeframes we are close to completing an edge to edge trade so the risk reward doesn’t fit my profile, however a break out from the cloud or above the Tenkan around $7777 will make me enter the market. 

The  RSI  and  MFI  have both been excellent indicators in this bear market.  Whenever  RSI  has gone above the 60 and the  MFI  80; its time to exit the market from a  bullish  trade and consider shorting as it progresses higher.   

Based on the  RSI ,  MFI  trends and the fact that we will run into the Kijun at just around $8-8.2k, I will be scalling out at this  bearish  confluence level to start looking for pull backs and reassessment as i believe it to be a key point as  

Best case scenario this trade would yield a 10% return before leverage. 
This is for illustrative purposes only, please DYOR and goodluck with your trading.

So the pullback trade that we were looking at worked out & has made it's way back to the neckline level of structure. We are now at what i like to call a ""decision point"" Essentially IF price is able to violate this current level od structure THEN we're likely to continue to our next price projection.  

Something that a lot of newer traders don't understand is that when it comes to bigger moves, the market will often provide multiple opportunities to get involved. For those who don't rush and for those who don't get discouraged. If you perform consistent analysis you can often find multiple ways to involve yourself in a trade even if you missed the first strike.

This is the way markets move, If you question my charting check my previous posts. Its as simple as pie. We are going down, How long and how far is too soon to say. Here is a chart that we can understand the future price action and where to buy back. Before you guys start blasting my comment section with the time and how it may not be right thats correct. I am not calculating the time I'm just making a technical drawing of the directions that we will see in the next few months.  

Recent price action has clear signs of wash trading / market manipulation fud and lots of nonsense. Its hard to prove almost impossible so as a trader we just need to deal with it. Ideally the situation you are supposed to trade are critical break up and break down points to enter the trade. Dont enter or exit dumb trades and lose money. As an experienced trader you should be looking for shorts, I would not consider a long unless we are over $10-12k

I am never good with words so instead of writing paragraphs of clarification to justify my call for SHORT since my last posting, I have explained everything on my chart with the least words possible using Fibonacci. It does not matter how popular  Bitcoin -1.40%  has become, or how deep it has disrupted the financial sector, or how many institutional investors have come to invest in it -- the psychology behind a market cycle does not change. 

I don't really encourage anyone to short  Bitcoin -1.40% , but in all honesty, don't expect the bulls to fly anytime soon. Like I said before, this correction that we are having right now is the ""MOTHER OF ALL CORRECTIONS"" after a 4-year-long bull cycle since the 2013 correction... and we are just halfway through.

My best idea ever, taking some time off the last 2 days :) The whales just continue to play their little games by squeezing leveraged short and long positions out of the market. Can't play them, it's just too easy. Maybe it's time we retail traders stand together, combine our  volume  and use their own game against them. Yeah, maybe we could even make a blockbuster movie about this :) I love me some science fiction :) LOL  

My last update of the previous analysis i showed 2 important support levels where the price could bounce up from. The first support around 7350 did the trick and the price got pushed back to 7700. From that point on i told my members that i thought i was seeing distribution, but it was still very confusing to figure out what was going on. TA was showing  bullish  signs, that  bull flag  was very strong and was even turning slowly up and was about to squeeze upwards. But of course out of no where the price got dumped, the move we saw a few hours ago. After that 200 point drop the price got pushed up again to 7700 like that dump was a glitch. If your a whale, why not push out leveraged traders and take your money while your accumulating or distributing. It's like a bonus, like the cherry on top :)  

Anyway, in this chart we can see allot of similarities of what is going on. As you know i have been saying i am still  bearish  for the medium term, but i just could not say what was going to happen on the short term. 2 days ago after we finally dropped out of that  wedge , i said we would have 2 options.  
- Break those 2 support levels from the last update of my previous chart (73xx and 71xx) 
- Make a higher low at those same support levels and make another move up above the high.  
 
As we can see in the chart, the  fractal  is not 100% identical so it's no guarantee that the 7700 high we just saw is the high already and that we start to move down. But based on this  fractal , i don't want to see the price get above the 7800/7900. This  fractal  confirms my  bearish  view as well. That's why TA is so great, you can turn any chart to fit your view :). 

Even without this  fractal , i just give it a very small chance that 7K price action is the fundament of a low to start another bull rally, i just highly doubt that. I want to see more  volume  to begin with and at least  double bottom  kind of formation. So the minimum i expect is a test of the 7100/6900in the coming week or 2. But the movement i have in mind for the med term is a drop below the 7K to form a big V shape low. If we get to see that, than i might even become  bullish  for the rest of the year :).  

As long as the price stays above the 73xx, we have to assume the bulls are still in control and we should see another wave up. So for me the 73xx is an important turning point.

					At the moment it looks like bulls are trying to push higher, this bull flag/triangle is still very strong. So no sign of weakness yet! First small sign would be a drop below 7620/7600. Bulls need to break 7700

					This is my bigger picture, think this bearish triangle is still 100% in play. I think if bulls can't break the 7800/7900 the bearish version is probably going to happen. Can't say HOW it will go, this blue line is just a guess. But a big V shape low would be the most bullish for the long term. I still think we are seeing distribution here. The only way this idea can be countered, is through a big increase of buying volume, if that doesn't happen, i think it's only a matter of time.

The price took a small dump but the volume was low so no real read on what the intent was. So we might see another move up, if we start to see a small pump that takes out the 7800, be aware of a fake breakout. The blue line is a possibility of what the move could look like IF we move up and if the breakout fails. If that happens than we will probably get confirmation if the price breaks the 7600ish. If we break the 7800 it should stay above the 7700 to confirm another move up. Not much more to say about what's going on.

451,1528359434.0,Taiwan_Bear,2618 (Double top & 0.618 pull-back) - do not miss it!!,"
In the last couple of TAs I have mentioned the “2618 pattern” and have been asked what 2618 means. Sorry for taking it so long as it took me quite a while to put everything altogether. But, as promised, I have explained below the rules and trade setups for the 2618 pattern.  

What are the rules/setups/steps for 2618?  
1.	Form a  double top  (Note #1)  
2.	Neckline has to be broken  
3.	After price found support at point (b), wait for pull back to 0.618 fib retracement of (a)(b)  
4.	After price retraced to 0.618, look for confluence and sell (eg. Structures,  trendlines  ,  double top  on a lower time frame,  rsi  divergence,  bearish pin bar  ,  inside bar  break down etc.) (Note #2)  
5.	Stop loss to be set above  double top 
6.	Set Take Profit levels (Note #3)  

Note #1 ( Double top ):  
The first step for the formation of 2618 is to form a  double top  at key resistance levels. Why at key resistance levels? Because we want to avoid fake double tops which can occur occasionally.  

There are some variations between various resources (books, websites) regarding the definitions of “double top”. The main differences occur where:  
a)	Some said for a  double top  to be valid, the wick of the 2nd top cannot exceed the wick of the 1st top; whereas, others said:  
b)	The wick of the 2nd top can exceed the wick of the 1st top but the candle close of the 2nd top CANNOT exceed the wick of the 1st top; or  
c)	The wick of the 2nd top can exceed the wick of the 1st top and the candle close of the 2nd top CAN exceed the wick of the 1st top; or  
d)	The wick of the 2nd top meets at least the candle close of the 1st top; or  
e)	The body of the 2nd top cannot exceed the body of the 1st top  

Personally, I would say all the above definitions work just fine although I do prefer definition a) because it means that the selling pressure is strong and the bulls fail to make a higher high. When there is a higher high formed in a downtrend, it can mean the downtrend has reversed and therefore you might not want to sell when the price pulls back to the 0.618 fib retracement.  

Note #2 ( 0.618 retracement ):  
When the price pulls back to 0.618, it does not mean to sell straight away. There must be more than one reason to sell other than the 0.618 retrace. The more reasons the better. In this example, you can see there are certainly structures (key resistance levels) at the 0.618 retrace. As well, there was a  double top  formed on the lower time frame. Consequently, you can sell.  

After  BTC -1.40%  hit the 0.618 retrace the first time, the price dropped from $9735 to $8650. but quickly bounced back to the 0.618 retrace level. That was a second & better opportunity to sell. Not only did  BTC -1.40%  form a  double top  on the larger time frame, but also with a  bearish  divergence on the 4hr time frame. Accordingly, you have more reasons to sell.  

Note #3 (Set take profit)  
Same as the rules of “Double top”, there are some variations as to which price level should you take profits. Personally, I would stick to the below:  
1)	First, take profit when risk/reward ratio hits 1:1 (recommend to take 30% - 50% profits and adjust the SL of the remaining positions to break-even)  
2)	When price hits the same price level as the low after the neckline is broken ((b) point in this example)  
3)	When price hits 1.272 fib extension of (a)(b)  
4)	When price hits point (d) (using  AB=CD  pattern. If you are not sure what the rules of  AB=CD  are, you can refer to my previous TA in which I have attached the link below)  
5)	If in a one-way market (heavily bearish/bullish), you can always keep 10% to 20% of your positions and take profits when risk/reward ratio hits 1:5 or even 1:10

 BTC -1.40%  is on the verge of breaking to a daily higher high on the bounce if the bulls can see a push this morning. 
If we reject from here the daily will form a lower high and we will see a tightening pattern within the highlighted  support and resistance  lines.  
Important for the bulls to show up or we could stay in this range into tomorrow.  
Healthy consolidation after the most recent bull move and the 15 min chart needs to change the trend.  
Also look to  EMA  12 support on the 4 hour and hourly.  
Another morning like yesterday with the bulls comfortable as worst case, we likely stay in the tightening pattern if bulls cannot prove themselves.

The current situation of  Bitcoin -1.40%  is quite difficult. We are on a clear treshold. A lot of traders are saying that we are on a clear downtrend, but the same amount of people are claiming that we will have our reversal soon. 

This article tries to sum up all important information you have to need! 

1: Retracement of a parabolic uptrend: 
There is a rule of thumb for the retracement of a parabolic uptrend. We should retrace to approx. the 0.786  Fibonacci Retracement  +/- 10%! 
Depending where we start the count, we are already in that target. Although both ways (blue and red) have still some space for a further downwave! 







2: The bloody support of Bitcoin: 
The average cost of mining one  bitcoin -1.40%  are at USA/Russia approx. 4700$ and at 3100$ for china! 
A drop below a target of 4700$ would be savage. Nevertheless, i can't image that we will hit that target. 







3: Manipulation of  Bitcoin -1.40%  and the Bart Simpson Pattern: 
A friend of mine found some unusual patterns in the orderbooks of several exchanges: 
https://twitter.com/CryptoSyndrome 
Altcoins are manipulated on a daily basis. It seems that  bitcoin -1.40%  is now affected to this too, which causes all these 3-5% pump and dumps. 
Thus, we are forming all the time the Bartin Simpsons Patterns. 

4: Similarity to 2014: 
Bitcoin -1.40%  now: 






Bitcoin -1.40%  2014: 







5: Deminishing downtrend and a strong support 
If we see the falling  wedges  as the force of the downtrend, then the force is diminishing! 
Furthermore we have strong support which is holding now for the 4th time! 







6: The Indicators 
Having a look at the indicators at 2D, we have a good potential for an upwave now. 
The  volume  is deminishing which should indicate a breakout soon. 
The  MACD  is about to cross, the  RSI  was slightly overbought and is heading up like the  Stoch .  RSI . 
The 200  EMA  is slighty under the current price and act as a support. 

7: The symetrical Triangle 
The theory says, that we should have in a  sym -0.80% . triangle 5 times an  ABC  wave. The waves are not perfect, but we can construct them. 






As you can see, the last four ABC-Waves formed always a 1:1 extention, which indicates that we have finished wave 5. 

8: A possible Head and Shoulders 
Even if this is not the most perfect  Head and Shoulders  Pattern, it's still valid! 
We are currently at the neckline, which is a strong and important resistance. Breaking upwards should indicate a good uptrend. 







9: The magic  6th 0.00%  of the month 






Suprisingly we have on every  6th 0.00%  of the month a reversal. Why is that??? 
One reason could be the  CME Group Futures  with dates for the settlements always nearby the  6th 0.00%  of the month!

11: Shortterm  Bullish  TA 
Leading diagonal  starting wave1 of an  Elliott Wave , since we have now an impulse wave, after the 5x  ABC  pattern inside the triangle is finished. 
Our target should be at the top of the triangle nearby 8600-8800$. 







12: Longterm  Bearish  TA 
We also can argue, that we are currenty in an downtrend and the  sym -0.80% . triangle just continuing the trend. 
Our target should be nearby 6000$ which is also a finished downwards  Elliott Wave .

Nothing is happening in the market:  volatility  has become extinct and coins' trading fallen out of fashion. Range-bound bots and robotic humans absolutely prosper in this environment. The price was unable to break the 7700 threshold. For me this is a  bearish  signal. Indicators provide mixed signals, so let's examine wave structure. The move from May 29 is a  3-wave -0.12%  correction within a larger downtrend. A price drop below 7500 would confirm this scenario.

					Impulse Wave Truncation (Truncated Fifth) - 
Truncated 5th wave is when the market has become so over-extended in Wave 3 that there is not much force left for the impulse wave to come to a proper completion. So when this happens, there is a chance that the last wave of the impulse, Wave 5, will not reach the end of Wave 3 before the market starts correcting in the opposite direction. At this point, the market is just too exhausted. This condition is often called a “failure” or a “Truncation.”

I can see many people still believe that we are going inside a  descending triangle . I also believed this in my idea that i shard on may 1st: 



 

Things can change so quickly and if we didn't adapt to the changes then someone will. That's why i believe that we have to be in fast adapt mode in this market. Doesn't mean that you need to change without checking yourself. I try to find 2-3 confirmations before i change my idea on something. This includes pattern changes, trend changes etc 

There are 21 corrective wave patterns in EW which is categorized into major 3 corrective wave patterns: 

Zigzag  (5-3-5) 
Flat (3-3-5) 
Triangle (3-3-3-3-3) 

And other patterns are combinations of the above which is:  

Double three (A combination of two corrective patterns above) 
Triple three (A combination of three corrective patterns above) 

So what i can see now is that we are in two double three combination corrective wave pattern: 








More info here:  

https://elliottwave-forecast.com/elliott-wave-theory/#corrective-waves 

Confirmations: 

1. Wave ((i)) of C is 1.6k and ((v)) is going to be completed below the triangle 
2. Wave (E) of the triangle can't go beyond the triangle.  
3. This has happened twice before in 2013 & 2015 

Each wave  got 3 subwaves (a,b &c) inside and we are in the subwave c of ((y)) of Y which is an impulsive wave. 

Impulsive waves: 1,3,5,a,c 
Corrective waves: 2,4,b 

Normal Fibo Ratios for these waves are: 

wave 2 = 0.5 - 0.8 of wave 1  
wave 3 = 1.236 - 1.618 of wave 1  
wave 4 = 0.5 - 0.618 of wave 3  
wave 5 = 0.618 - 1 of wave 1  
wave B = 0.5 - 0.8 of wave A  
wave C = 0.618 - 1.236 of wave A  

Now if you check what happened in subwave a of ((y)) of Y you can see that: 

Wave (i) of a: 985$ 
Wave (ii) of a: 434$  
Wave ( iii 0.17% ) of a: 1207$  
Wave (iv) of a: 691$ [~0.618 of Wave ( iii 0.17% )] 
Wave (v) of a: 950$  








I have seen  BTC -1.42%  impulsive waves fibo ratios almost the same as the previous impulsive wave fibo ratios. 
Now if you apply the same for the last wave C of (E) this is what you get: 

Wave ((i)) of c: 1587$ 
Wave ((ii)) of c  = 793$ 
Wave (( iii 0.17% )) of c  = 1961$ 
Wave ((iv)) of c [~0.618 of Wave (( iii 0.17% ))] = 1212$ 
Wave ((v)) of c  = 1587$ 








Also note that Wave ((iv)) might not retrace upto 0.618 of Wave (( iii 0.17% )) as everyone will be in panic mode by that time so minimum retracement would be around 0.386 of Wave (( iii 0.17% )) which is around 756$ and this is why i can see it goes down to 5k level or little bit more towards 4.7k which is the lowest level of the  support zone  (orange dotted lines) 








So 3 Possible Support lines for reversal would be 

1. Blue: 5800 - 6100 (Only possible if Wave ((v)) is truncated) 
2. Orange: 4700 - 5000 (This is most likely where we heading)  
3. Red: 4100 - 4400 (Only possible if Wave (( iii 0.17% )) is extended)

 Bitcoin -1.42%  has recently developed an interesting pattern of completing a  bullish  and  bearish  cycle on the sixth of every month in an alternating order. As we can see in the chart above, a fall is followed by a rise. This has happened twice before and is expected to happen again now on the  6th 0.00%  of June, 2018. This time  Bitcoin -1.42%  will finish a  bearish  cycle and I expected to begin the next  bullish  cycle at least till the end of  6th 0.00%  of July, 2018. 

This pattern of rise and fall is also supported by other patterns on the chart that signal a  bullish  reversal. The support line has also held firmly and if this pattern of alternating rise and fall ensues,  Bitcoin -1.42%  could very well make new highs by the end of the year. The  RSI  is recovering from oversold levels and has now approached a normal.  Bitcoin -1.42%  is currently at a favorable point for  bullish  entries. The price broke a long term resistance as it break past the downtrend line in April, 2018. This was a big accomplishment for the bulls but the lack of confidence pulled the price back to the support line. Currently, the price is just above the support line and appears to be all set for a  bullish  comeback but the reality is, there are not enough bulls in the market. 

The past few months have been devastating for the price of  Bitcoin -1.42%  ( BTC -1.42% ) and a lot of investors are still running scared. Institutional investors are looking for more clarity regarding regulations concerning cryptocurrencies and also safer ways to invest and store their coins. As for retail investors, most of them comprise of first time investors who have never traded any financial asset before. So, when they saw that  Bitcoin -1.42%  ( BTC -1.42% ) is making 20% gains every day, they thought this could go on forever and jumped with both feet, only to find the carpet pulled under from their feet. Big investors have always played small investors as cannon fodder and have gotten away with their schemes even in regulated markets like forex or the stock market. Cryptocurrencies is a new market with no proper regulations which means it is natural to expect that those who can afford to not play by the rules, most likely won’t.

Hello friends,  

It's been a while since my last post; lack of time and an urge to do more research has mainly driven me to take a break from posting ideas on TradingView. I am still in the process of doing more research and study, but I figure posting once in a while couldn't hurt. 

Since I have become recently very convinced about this, I am outlining a very possible situation with  Bitcoin -1.42%  where the  trend line  we have been on since early October breaks, reaching around a temporary low of $5000. This is examined on the  daily chart , since this is one of the best charts to examine trends of this size. I have to first and foremost say that I am not trying to spread fear, I know many people do not like to hear  bearish  ideas, but  technical analysis  is ultimately a rational exercise, and I feel that possibilities with very strong signs should be explored. 

There are a few things to look at, but I first want to talk about the big picture with, long-term  support and resistance  lines. I think most people can agree that there was a very significant downtrending resistance line that began from the peak of the  ATH 0.63%  in late December, to the low of around $6400 (thick red line). After the break from that line, it seems we moved into a sideways trend, bouncing back and forth between an emerging downtrending resistance line (light red) and a support line that we seem to have been respecting since mid-October (light green); at least this appears to be the case with the lows, where the angle's effectiveness appears very strongly. Finally, based on previous bounces, we can establish a support of around $5000-$5300 (I've thus created a small  support zone  around that range, in dark green), as well as lower supports around $3200 and $2000 (though I do not believe these will be reached, in dark green).   

Now, onto the analysis - it's no secret that  Bitcoin -1.42%  has been squeezing in, ready for a significant move either upwards or downwards. Initially I considered the upwards move to be more likely due to the significant media attention cryptocurrency has been receiving, but after viewing previous market cycles of  Bitcoin -1.42%  (check 2013), it seems clear to me that the  bearish  scenario of closing in on the market cycle is very likely, and should at the very least be prepared for with proper risk management. According to Dow Theory, which is said to have laid the foundations of modern  technical analysis , history repeats itself, and this is a situation where we forced to consider this. 

Should we break from the line, we will likely fall straight down to the $5000-$5000 area, where we will shoot back up and bounce towards around $6700 or so (maybe a little less). From there one, we will likely enter a sideways trend, which we will continue until we see higher highs and higher lows and parabolic movement returns, which could lead to us challenging the all-time high, and hitting $35k-$50k. 

NOTE: I seem to have reached the max character limit for this section of the idea, so I will continue my text below.

Comment:
					Onto the short-term: 


Scenario A: 

The reason why I have drawn this movement into a pennant is this way, is simply because we have been moving through this ascending triangle for quite a while now (May 23rd to today). I don't think that the pattern will be sufficient to directly lead into a strong sell-off, but we should consider that the size of ascending triangle suggests a small movement downwards at the very least, which can create a higher low, and thus move into position into a bearish pennant. Why would a bearish pennant occur here and not have a bounce to $8500-$8700? The reason is in positioning - the huge downtrend (May 5th to May 26th) creates a very nice flagpole in which it hits around the $5000 area very perfectly, and thus I would not be surprised if this happens. 

Second reason: on the Stoch RSI indicator on the daily chart, it appears to be dangerously high, which would suggest it being oversold. For the most part, it seems to have called lows and highs, at least to some extent. This overdrawn movement may very well have increased the likelyhood of Bitcoin being oversold. This could suggest that this is the last step into a sharp downturn, but this does not preclude Situation B. Volume has also been steadily decreasing, but this is the case with any sort of consolidation, I believe. 

Finally, the lines I have drawn below the triangle are simply bounces that I think seem fairly reasonable. The length from to support to the lines correlate with the length of the flagpole, of course, though it may seem chopped off due to the huge line from the long-term support downwards. 


Scenario B: 

This is much simpler, Bitcoin hits the upper resistance line, bounces off, challenges the lower support line, and we potentially see a break, and the rest unfolds from there. 


----------------------------------------------------------------------- 


With all this being said, do not fear if you are hoping for more parabolic movement - this likely will not be the end, and will simply be the set up for a long, drawn out sideways movement until the first signs of bullish activity begin and we start all over again. If you are longing around here, please consider using risk management, prepare for every possibility. If you are shorting, the same applies. 

Please trade with care. I wish the best to all traders!

Comment:
					This really is a very minor note, but I just want to emphasize that the rising wedge (which I erroneously refer to as an ascending triangle, a bad habit I have) entering a bearish pennant is more based on intuition than anything. Also, this pennant is mainly based on the conservative assumption that the break will happen at 7900, if it happens at 7700 where we seem to be general resistance, the pennant would look something like this:

Jun 7




I am Mid term-bullish on  BTC -1.42%  going into the end of this week, but looking to get into the market on a pull back to occur before I get in to the market.  The jury is still out as to whether this weekly bear trend is ready to turn around.  

We can see that both the  RSI  and  MFI  are both  Bullish  on the daily having bottomed when reaching oversold on both at c. $7k support where we found our longer term  trend line . 

We are currently in the process of meeting the Tenkan (blue line) as I write this, so in the very short term, I am looking for a pull back to $7550 range for an entry.  One of the main reasons for this is that on the 4hour timeframes we are close to completing an edge to edge trade so the risk reward doesn’t fit my profile, however a break out from the cloud or above the Tenkan around $7777 will make me enter the market. 

The  RSI  and  MFI  have both been excellent indicators in this bear market.  Whenever  RSI  has gone above the 60 and the  MFI  80; its time to exit the market from a  bullish  trade and consider shorting as it progresses higher.   

Based on the  RSI ,  MFI  trends and the fact that we will run into the Kijun at just around $8-8.2k, I will be scalling out at this  bearish  confluence level to start looking for pull backs and reassessment as i believe it to be a key point as  

Best case scenario this trade would yield a 10% return before leverage. 
This is for illustrative purposes only, please DYOR and goodluck with your trading.

So the pullback trade that we were looking at worked out & has made it's way back to the neckline level of structure. We are now at what i like to call a ""decision point"" Essentially IF price is able to violate this current level od structure THEN we're likely to continue to our next price projection.  

Something that a lot of newer traders don't understand is that when it comes to bigger moves, the market will often provide multiple opportunities to get involved. For those who don't rush and for those who don't get discouraged. If you perform consistent analysis you can often find multiple ways to involve yourself in a trade even if you missed the first strike.

Recent price action has clear signs of wash trading / market manipulation fud and lots of nonsense. Its hard to prove almost impossible so as a trader we just need to deal with it. Ideally the situation you are supposed to trade are critical break up and break down points to enter the trade. Dont enter or exit dumb trades and lose money.

My best idea ever, taking some time off the last 2 days :) The whales just continue to play their little games by squeezing leveraged short and long positions out of the market. Can't play them, it's just too easy. Maybe it's time we retail traders stand together, combine our  volume  and use their own game against them. Yeah, maybe we could even make a blockbuster movie about this :) I love me some science fiction :) LOL  

My last update of the previous analysis i showed 2 important support levels where the price could bounce up from. The first support around 7350 did the trick and the price got pushed back to 7700. From that point on i told my members that i thought i was seeing distribution, but it was still very confusing to figure out what was going on. TA was showing  bullish  signs, that  bull flag  was very strong and was even turning slowly up and was about to squeeze upwards. But of course out of no where the price got dumped, the move we saw a few hours ago. After that 200 point drop the price got pushed up again to 7700 like that dump was a glitch. If your a whale, why not push out leveraged traders and take your money while your accumulating or distributing. It's like a bonus, like the cherry on top :)  

Anyway, in this chart we can see allot of similarities of what is going on. As you know i have been saying i am still  bearish  for the medium term, but i just could not say what was going to happen on the short term. 2 days ago after we finally dropped out of that  wedge , i said we would have 2 options.  
- Break those 2 support levels from the last update of my previous chart (73xx and 71xx) 
- Make a higher low at those same support levels and make another move up above the high.  
 
As we can see in the chart, the  fractal  is not 100% identical so it's no guarantee that the 7700 high we just saw is the high already and that we start to move down. But based on this  fractal , i don't want to see the price get above the 7800/7900. This  fractal  confirms my  bearish  view as well. That's why TA is so great, you can turn any chart to fit your view :). 

Even without this  fractal , i just give it a very small chance that 7K price action is the fundament of a low to start another bull rally, i just highly doubt that. I want to see more  volume  to begin with and at least  double bottom  kind of formation. So the minimum i expect is a test of the 7100/6900in the coming week or 2. But the movement i have in mind for the med term is a drop below the 7K to form a big V shape low. If we get to see that, than i might even become  bullish  for the rest of the year :).  

As long as the price stays above the 73xx, we have to assume the bulls are still in control and we should see another wave up. So for me the 73xx is an important turning point.

					At the moment it looks like bulls are trying to push higher, this bull flag/triangle is still very strong. So no sign of weakness yet! First small sign would be a drop below 7620/7600. Bulls need to break 7700

					This is my bigger picture, think this bearish triangle is still 100% in play. I think if bulls can't break the 7800/7900 the bearish version is probably going to happen. Can't say HOW it will go, this blue line is just a guess. But a big V shape low would be the most bullish for the long term. I still think we are seeing distribution here. The only way this idea can be countered, is through a big increase of buying volume, if that doesn't happen, i think it's only a matter of time.

					Lower time frame we can see a new upwards channel and maybe even a rising wedge. From the looks of it, it's slowly going down to test the support line again. Depending on what will happen there we can make a better prediction for the rest of the day.

					What a surprise, nothing has changed :) 

The price took a small dump but the volume was low so no real read on what the intent was. So we might see another move up, if we start to see a small pump that takes out the 7800, be aware of a fake breakout. The blue line is a possibility of what the move could look like IF we move up and if the breakout fails. If that happens than we will probably get confirmation if the price breaks the 7600ish. If we break the 7800 it should stay above the 7700 to confirm another move up. Not much more to say about what's going on.

469,1528359434.0,Taiwan_Bear,2618 (Double top & 0.618 pull-back) - do not miss it!!,"
In the last couple of TAs I have mentioned the “2618 pattern” and have been asked what 2618 means. Sorry for taking it so long as it took me quite a while to put everything altogether. But, as promised, I have explained below the rules and trade setups for the 2618 pattern.  

What are the rules/setups/steps for 2618?  
1.	Form a  double top  (Note #1)  
2.	Neckline has to be broken  
3.	After price found support at point (b), wait for pull back to 0.618 fib retracement of (a)(b)  
4.	After price retraced to 0.618, look for confluence and sell (eg. Structures,  trendlines  ,  double top  on a lower time frame,  rsi  divergence,  bearish pin bar  ,  inside bar  break down etc.) (Note #2)  
5.	Stop loss to be set above  double top 
6.	Set Take Profit levels (Note #3)  

Note #1 ( Double top ):  
The first step for the formation of 2618 is to form a  double top  at key resistance levels. Why at key resistance levels? Because we want to avoid fake double tops which can occur occasionally.  

There are some variations between various resources (books, websites) regarding the definitions of “double top”. The main differences occur where:  
a)	Some said for a  double top  to be valid, the wick of the 2nd top cannot exceed the wick of the 1st top; whereas, others said:  
b)	The wick of the 2nd top can exceed the wick of the 1st top but the candle close of the 2nd top CANNOT exceed the wick of the 1st top; or  
c)	The wick of the 2nd top can exceed the wick of the 1st top and the candle close of the 2nd top CAN exceed the wick of the 1st top; or  
d)	The wick of the 2nd top meets at least the candle close of the 1st top; or  
e)	The body of the 2nd top cannot exceed the body of the 1st top  

Personally, I would say all the above definitions work just fine although I do prefer definition a) because it means that the selling pressure is strong and the bulls fail to make a higher high. When there is a higher high formed in a downtrend, it can mean the downtrend has reversed and therefore you might not want to sell when the price pulls back to the 0.618 fib retracement.  

Note #2 ( 0.618 retracement ):  
When the price pulls back to 0.618, it does not mean to sell straight away. There must be more than one reason to sell other than the 0.618 retrace. The more reasons the better. In this example, you can see there are certainly structures (key resistance levels) at the 0.618 retrace. As well, there was a  double top  formed on the lower time frame. Consequently, you can sell.  

After  BTC -1.45%  hit the 0.618 retrace the first time, the price dropped from $9735 to $8650. but quickly bounced back to the 0.618 retrace level. That was a second & better opportunity to sell. Not only did  BTC -1.45%  form a  double top  on the larger time frame, but also with a  bearish  divergence on the 4hr time frame. Accordingly, you have more reasons to sell.  

Note #3 (Set take profit)  
Same as the rules of “Double top”, there are some variations as to which price level should you take profits. Personally, I would stick to the below:  
1)	First, take profit when risk/reward ratio hits 1:1 (recommend to take 30% - 50% profits and adjust the SL of the remaining positions to break-even)  
2)	When price hits the same price level as the low after the neckline is broken ((b) point in this example)  
3)	When price hits 1.272 fib extension of (a)(b)  
4)	When price hits point (d) (using  AB=CD  pattern. If you are not sure what the rules of  AB=CD  are, you can refer to my previous TA in which I have attached the link below)  
5)	If in a one-way market (heavily bearish/bullish), you can always keep 10% to 20% of your positions and take profits when risk/reward ratio hits 1:5 or even 1:10

 BTC -1.45%  is on the verge of breaking to a daily higher high on the bounce if the bulls can see a push this morning. 
If we reject from here the daily will form a lower high and we will see a tightening pattern within the highlighted  support and resistance  lines.  
Important for the bulls to show up or we could stay in this range into tomorrow.  
Healthy consolidation after the most recent bull move and the 15 min chart needs to change the trend.  
Also look to  EMA  12 support on the 4 hour and hourly.  
Another morning like yesterday with the bulls comfortable as worst case, we likely stay in the tightening pattern if bulls cannot prove themselves.

The current situation of  Bitcoin -1.45%  is quite difficult. We are on a clear treshold. A lot of traders are saying that we are on a clear downtrend, but the same amount of people are claiming that we will have our reversal soon. 

This article tries to sum up all important information you have to need! 

1: Retracement of a parabolic uptrend: 
There is a rule of thumb for the retracement of a parabolic uptrend. We should retrace to approx. the 0.786  Fibonacci Retracement  +/- 10%! 
Depending where we start the count, we are already in that target. Although both ways (blue and red) have still some space for a further downwave! 







2: The bloody support of Bitcoin: 
The average cost of mining one  bitcoin -1.45%  are at USA/Russia approx. 4700$ and at 3100$ for china! 
A drop below a target of 4700$ would be savage. Nevertheless, i can't image that we will hit that target. 







3: Manipulation of  Bitcoin -1.45%  and the Bart Simpson Pattern: 
A friend of mine found some unusual patterns in the orderbooks of several exchanges: 
https://twitter.com/CryptoSyndrome 
Altcoins are manipulated on a daily basis. It seems that  bitcoin -1.45%  is now affected to this too, which causes all these 3-5% pump and dumps. 
Thus, we are forming all the time the Bartin Simpsons Patterns. 

4: Similarity to 2014: 
Bitcoin -1.45%  now: 






Bitcoin -1.45%  2014: 







5: Deminishing downtrend and a strong support 
If we see the falling  wedges  as the force of the downtrend, then the force is diminishing! 
Furthermore we have strong support which is holding now for the 4th time! 







6: The Indicators 
Having a look at the indicators at 2D, we have a good potential for an upwave now. 
The  volume  is deminishing which should indicate a breakout soon. 
The  MACD  is about to cross, the  RSI  was slightly overbought and is heading up like the  Stoch .  RSI . 
The 200  EMA  is slighty under the current price and act as a support. 

7: The symetrical Triangle 
The theory says, that we should have in a  sym -1.72% . triangle 5 times an  ABC  wave. The waves are not perfect, but we can construct them. 






As you can see, the last four ABC-Waves formed always a 1:1 extention, which indicates that we have finished wave 5. 

8: A possible Head and Shoulders 
Even if this is not the most perfect  Head and Shoulders  Pattern, it's still valid! 
We are currently at the neckline, which is a strong and important resistance. Breaking upwards should indicate a good uptrend. 







9: The magic  6th 0.00%  of the month 






Suprisingly we have on every  6th 0.00%  of the month a reversal. Why is that??? 
One reason could be the  CME Group Futures  with dates for the settlements always nearby the  6th 0.00%  of the month! 
http://www.cmegroup.com 

10: Longterm  Bullish  TA 
The whole pattern could be seen as a big  bullish pennant . 







11: Shortterm  Bullish  TA 
Leading diagonal  starting wave1 of an  Elliott Wave , since we have now an impulse wave, after the 5x  ABC  pattern inside the triangle is finished. 
Our target should be at the top of the triangle nearby 8600-8800$. 







12: Longterm  Bearish  TA 
We also can argue, that we are currenty in an downtrend and the  sym -1.72% . triangle just continuing the trend. 
Our target should be nearby 6000$ which is also a finished downwards  Elliott Wave .

Nothing is happening in the market:  volatility  has become extinct and coins' trading fallen out of fashion. Range-bound bots and robotic humans absolutely prosper in this environment. The price was unable to break the 7700 threshold. For me this is a  bearish  signal. Indicators provide mixed signals, so let's examine wave structure. The move from May 29 is a  3-wave -0.12%  correction within a larger downtrend. A price drop below 7500 would confirm this scenario.

					Impulse Wave Truncation (Truncated Fifth) - 
Truncated 5th wave is when the market has become so over-extended in Wave 3 that there is not much force left for the impulse wave to come to a proper completion. So when this happens, there is a chance that the last wave of the impulse, Wave 5, will not reach the end of Wave 3 before the market starts correcting in the opposite direction. At this point, the market is just too exhausted. This condition is often called a “failure” or a “Truncation.”

I can see many people still believe that we are going inside a  descending triangle . I also believed this in my idea that i shard on may 1st: 



 

Things can change so quickly and if we didn't adapt to the changes then someone will. That's why i believe that we have to be in fast adapt mode in this market. Doesn't mean that you need to change without checking yourself. I try to find 2-3 confirmations before i change my idea on something. This includes pattern changes, trend changes etc 

There are 21 corrective wave patterns in EW which is categorized into major 3 corrective wave patterns: 

Zigzag  (5-3-5) 
Flat (3-3-5) 
Triangle (3-3-3-3-3) 

And other patterns are combinations of the above which is:  

Double three (A combination of two corrective patterns above) 
Triple three (A combination of three corrective patterns above) 

So what i can see now is that we are in two double three combination corrective wave pattern: 








More info here:  

https://elliottwave-forecast.com/elliott-wave-theory/#corrective-waves 

Confirmations: 

1. Wave ((i)) of C is 1.6k and ((v)) is going to be completed below the triangle 
2. Wave (E) of the triangle can't go beyond the triangle.  
3. This has happened twice before in 2013 & 2015 

Each wave  got 3 subwaves (a,b &c) inside and we are in the subwave c of ((y)) of Y which is an impulsive wave. 

Impulsive waves: 1,3,5,a,c 
Corrective waves: 2,4,b 

Normal Fibo Ratios for these waves are: 

wave 2 = 0.5 - 0.8 of wave 1  
wave 3 = 1.236 - 1.618 of wave 1  
wave 4 = 0.5 - 0.618 of wave 3  
wave 5 = 0.618 - 1 of wave 1  
wave B = 0.5 - 0.8 of wave A  
wave C = 0.618 - 1.236 of wave A  

Now if you check what happened in subwave a of ((y)) of Y you can see that: 

Wave (i) of a: 985$ 
Wave (ii) of a: 434$  
Wave ( iii -0.45% ) of a: 1207$  
Wave (iv) of a: 691$ [~0.618 of Wave ( iii -0.45% )] 
Wave (v) of a: 950$  








I have seen  BTC -1.48%  impulsive waves fibo ratios almost the same as the previous impulsive wave fibo ratios. 
Now if you apply the same for the last wave C of (E) this is what you get: 

Wave ((i)) of c: 1587$ 
Wave ((ii)) of c  = 793$ 
Wave (( iii -0.45% )) of c  = 1961$ 
Wave ((iv)) of c [~0.618 of Wave (( iii -0.45% ))] = 1212$ 
Wave ((v)) of c  = 1587$ 








Also note that Wave ((iv)) might not retrace upto 0.618 of Wave (( iii -0.45% )) as everyone will be in panic mode by that time so minimum retracement would be around 0.386 of Wave (( iii -0.45% )) which is around 756$ and this is why i can see it goes down to 5k level or little bit more towards 4.7k which is the lowest level of the  support zone  (orange dotted lines) 








So 3 Possible Support lines for reversal would be 

1. Blue: 5800 - 6100 (Only possible if Wave ((v)) is truncated) 
2. Orange: 4700 - 5000 (This is most likely where we heading)  
3. Red: 4100 - 4400 (Only possible if Wave (( iii -0.45% )) is extended)

 Bitcoin -1.54%  has recently developed an interesting pattern of completing a  bullish  and  bearish  cycle on the sixth of every month in an alternating order. As we can see in the chart above, a fall is followed by a rise. This has happened twice before and is expected to happen again now on the  6th 0.00%  of June, 2018. This time  Bitcoin -1.54%  will finish a  bearish  cycle and I expected to begin the next  bullish  cycle at least till the end of  6th 0.00%  of July, 2018. 

This pattern of rise and fall is also supported by other patterns on the chart that signal a  bullish  reversal. The support line has also held firmly and if this pattern of alternating rise and fall ensues,  Bitcoin -1.54%  could very well make new highs by the end of the year. The  RSI  is recovering from oversold levels and has now approached a normal.  Bitcoin -1.54%  is currently at a favorable point for  bullish  entries. The price broke a long term resistance as it break past the downtrend line in April, 2018. This was a big accomplishment for the bulls but the lack of confidence pulled the price back to the support line. Currently, the price is just above the support line and appears to be all set for a  bullish  comeback but the reality is, there are not enough bulls in the market. 

The past few months have been devastating for the price of  Bitcoin -1.54%  ( BTC -1.54% ) and a lot of investors are still running scared. Institutional investors are looking for more clarity regarding regulations concerning cryptocurrencies and also safer ways to invest and store their coins. As for retail investors, most of them comprise of first time investors who have never traded any financial asset before. So, when they saw that  Bitcoin -1.54%  ( BTC -1.54% ) is making 20% gains every day, they thought this could go on forever and jumped with both feet, only to find the carpet pulled under from their feet. Big investors have always played small investors as cannon fodder and have gotten away with their schemes even in regulated markets like forex or the stock market. Cryptocurrencies is a new market with no proper regulations which means it is natural to expect that those who can afford to not play by the rules, most likely won’t.

Hello friends,  

It's been a while since my last post; lack of time and an urge to do more research has mainly driven me to take a break from posting ideas on TradingView. I am still in the process of doing more research and study, but I figure posting once in a while couldn't hurt. 

Since I have become recently very convinced about this, I am outlining a very possible situation with  Bitcoin -1.57%  where the  trend line  we have been on since early October breaks, reaching around a temporary low of $5000. This is examined on the  daily chart , since this is one of the best charts to examine trends of this size. I have to first and foremost say that I am not trying to spread fear, I know many people do not like to hear  bearish  ideas, but  technical analysis  is ultimately a rational exercise, and I feel that possibilities with very strong signs should be explored. 

There are a few things to look at, but I first want to talk about the big picture with, long-term  support and resistance  lines. I think most people can agree that there was a very significant downtrending resistance line that began from the peak of the  ATH 0.63%  in late December, to the low of around $6400 (thick red line). After the break from that line, it seems we moved into a sideways trend, bouncing back and forth between an emerging downtrending resistance line (light red) and a support line that we seem to have been respecting since mid-October (light green); at least this appears to be the case with the lows, where the angle's effectiveness appears very strongly. Finally, based on previous bounces, we can establish a support of around $5000-$5300 (I've thus created a small  support zone  around that range, in dark green), as well as lower supports around $3200 and $2000 (though I do not believe these will be reached, in dark green).   

Now, onto the analysis - it's no secret that  Bitcoin -1.57%  has been squeezing in, ready for a significant move either upwards or downwards. Initially I considered the upwards move to be more likely due to the significant media attention cryptocurrency has been receiving, but after viewing previous market cycles of  Bitcoin -1.57%  (check 2013), it seems clear to me that the  bearish  scenario of closing in on the market cycle is very likely, and should at the very least be prepared for with proper risk management. According to Dow Theory, which is said to have laid the foundations of modern  technical analysis , history repeats itself, and this is a situation where we forced to consider this. 

Should we break from the line, we will likely fall straight down to the $5000-$5000 area, where we will shoot back up and bounce towards around $6700 or so (maybe a little less). From there one, we will likely enter a sideways trend, which we will continue until we see higher highs and higher lows and parabolic movement returns, which could lead to us challenging the all-time high, and hitting $35k-$50k. 

NOTE: I seem to have reached the max character limit for this section of the idea, so I will continue my text below.

Comment:
					Onto the short-term: 


Scenario A: 

The reason why I have drawn this movement into a pennant is this way, is simply because we have been moving through this ascending triangle for quite a while now (May 23rd to today). I don't think that the pattern will be sufficient to directly lead into a strong sell-off, but we should consider that the size of ascending triangle suggests a small movement downwards at the very least, which can create a higher low, and thus move into position into a bearish pennant. Why would a bearish pennant occur here and not have a bounce to $8500-$8700? The reason is in positioning - the huge downtrend (May 5th to May 26th) creates a very nice flagpole in which it hits around the $5000 area very perfectly, and thus I would not be surprised if this happens. 

Second reason: on the Stoch RSI indicator on the daily chart, it appears to be dangerously high, which would suggest it being oversold. For the most part, it seems to have called lows and highs, at least to some extent. This overdrawn movement may very well have increased the likelyhood of Bitcoin being oversold. This could suggest that this is the last step into a sharp downturn, but this does not preclude Situation B. Volume has also been steadily decreasing, but this is the case with any sort of consolidation, I believe. 

Finally, the lines I have drawn below the triangle are simply bounces that I think seem fairly reasonable. The length from to support to the lines correlate with the length of the flagpole, of course, though it may seem chopped off due to the huge line from the long-term support downwards. 


Scenario B: 

This is much simpler, Bitcoin hits the upper resistance line, bounces off, challenges the lower support line, and we potentially see a break, and the rest unfolds from there. 


----------------------------------------------------------------------- 


With all this being said, do not fear if you are hoping for more parabolic movement - this likely will not be the end, and will simply be the set up for a long, drawn out sideways movement until the first signs of bullish activity begin and we start all over again. If you are longing around here, please consider using risk management, prepare for every possibility. If you are shorting, the same applies. 

Please trade with care. I wish the best to all traders!

Comment:
					This really is a very minor note, but I just want to emphasize that the rising wedge (which I erroneously refer to as an ascending triangle, a bad habit I have) entering a bearish pennant is more based on intuition than anything. Also, this pennant is mainly based on the conservative assumption that the break will happen at 7900, if it happens at 7700 where we seem to be general resistance, the pennant would look something like this:

Jun 7




I am Mid term-bullish on  BTC -1.55%  going into the end of this week, but looking to get into the market on a pull back to occur before I get in to the market.  The jury is still out as to whether this weekly bear trend is ready to turn around.  

We can see that both the  RSI  and  MFI  are both  Bullish  on the daily having bottomed when reaching oversold on both at c. $7k support where we found our longer term  trend line . 

We are currently in the process of meeting the Tenkan (blue line) as I write this, so in the very short term, I am looking for a pull back to $7550 range for an entry.  One of the main reasons for this is that on the 4hour timeframes we are close to completing an edge to edge trade so the risk reward doesn’t fit my profile, however a break out from the cloud or above the Tenkan around $7777 will make me enter the market. 

The  RSI  and  MFI  have both been excellent indicators in this bear market.  Whenever  RSI  has gone above the 60 and the  MFI  80; its time to exit the market from a  bullish  trade and consider shorting as it progresses higher.   

Based on the  RSI ,  MFI  trends and the fact that we will run into the Kijun at just around $8-8.2k, I will be scalling out at this  bearish  confluence level to start looking for pull backs and reassessment as i believe it to be a key point as  

Best case scenario this trade would yield a 10% return before leverage. 
This is for illustrative purposes only, please DYOR and goodluck with your trading.

So the pullback trade that we were looking at worked out & has made it's way back to the neckline level of structure. We are now at what i like to call a ""decision point"" Essentially IF price is able to violate this current level od structure THEN we're likely to continue to our next price projection.  

Something that a lot of newer traders don't understand is that when it comes to bigger moves, the market will often provide multiple opportunities to get involved. For those who don't rush and for those who don't get discouraged. If you perform consistent analysis you can often find multiple ways to involve yourself in a trade even if you missed the first strike.

This is the way markets move, If you question my charting check my previous posts. Its as simple as pie. We are going down, How long and how far is too soon to say. Here is a chart that we can understand the future price action and where to buy back. Before you guys start blasting my comment section with the time and how it may not be right thats correct. I am not calculating the time I'm just making a technical drawing of the directions that we will see in the next few months.  

Recent price action has clear signs of wash trading / market manipulation fud and lots of nonsense. Its hard to prove almost impossible so as a trader we just need to deal with it. Ideally the situation you are supposed to trade are critical break up and break down points to enter the trade. Dont enter or exit dumb trades and lose money. As an experienced trader you should be looking for shorts, I would not consider a long unless we are over $10-12k

I am never good with words so instead of writing paragraphs of clarification to justify my call for SHORT since my last posting, I have explained everything on my chart with the least words possible using Fibonacci. It does not matter how popular  Bitcoin -1.55%  has become, or how deep it has disrupted the financial sector, or how many institutional investors have come to invest in it -- the psychology behind a market cycle does not change. 

I don't really encourage anyone to short  Bitcoin -1.55% , but in all honesty, don't expect the bulls to fly anytime soon. Like I said before, this correction that we are having right now is the ""MOTHER OF ALL CORRECTIONS"" after a 4-year-long bull cycle since the 2013 correction... and we are just halfway through.

My best idea ever, taking some time off the last 2 days :) The whales just continue to play their little games by squeezing leveraged short and long positions out of the market. Can't play them, it's just too easy. Maybe it's time we retail traders stand together, combine our  volume  and use their own game against them. Yeah, maybe we could even make a blockbuster movie about this :) I love me some science fiction :) LOL  

My last update of the previous analysis i showed 2 important support levels where the price could bounce up from. The first support around 7350 did the trick and the price got pushed back to 7700. From that point on i told my members that i thought i was seeing distribution, but it was still very confusing to figure out what was going on. TA was showing  bullish  signs, that  bull flag  was very strong and was even turning slowly up and was about to squeeze upwards. But of course out of no where the price got dumped, the move we saw a few hours ago. After that 200 point drop the price got pushed up again to 7700 like that dump was a glitch. If your a whale, why not push out leveraged traders and take your money while your accumulating or distributing. It's like a bonus, like the cherry on top :)  

Anyway, in this chart we can see allot of similarities of what is going on. As you know i have been saying i am still  bearish  for the medium term, but i just could not say what was going to happen on the short term. 2 days ago after we finally dropped out of that  wedge , i said we would have 2 options.  
- Break those 2 support levels from the last update of my previous chart (73xx and 71xx) 
- Make a higher low at those same support levels and make another move up above the high.  
 
As we can see in the chart, the  fractal  is not 100% identical so it's no guarantee that the 7700 high we just saw is the high already and that we start to move down. But based on this  fractal , i don't want to see the price get above the 7800/7900. This  fractal  confirms my  bearish  view as well. That's why TA is so great, you can turn any chart to fit your view :). 

Even without this  fractal , i just give it a very small chance that 7K price action is the fundament of a low to start another bull rally, i just highly doubt that. I want to see more  volume  to begin with and at least  double bottom  kind of formation. So the minimum i expect is a test of the 7100/6900in the coming week or 2. But the movement i have in mind for the med term is a drop below the 7K to form a big V shape low. If we get to see that, than i might even become  bullish  for the rest of the year :).  

As long as the price stays above the 73xx, we have to assume the bulls are still in control and we should see another wave up. So for me the 73xx is an important turning point.

					At the moment it looks like bulls are trying to push higher, this bull flag/triangle is still very strong. So no sign of weakness yet! First small sign would be a drop below 7620/7600. Bulls need to break 7700

Comment:
					This is my bigger picture, think this bearish triangle is still 100% in play. I think if bulls can't break the 7800/7900 the bearish version is probably going to happen. Can't say HOW it will go, this blue line is just a guess. But a big V shape low would be the most bullish for the long term. I still think we are seeing distribution here. The only way this idea can be countered, is through a big increase of buying volume, if that doesn't happen, i think it's only a matter of time.

The price took a small dump but the volume was low so no real read on what the intent was. So we might see another move up, if we start to see a small pump that takes out the 7800, be aware of a fake breakout. The blue line is a possibility of what the move could look like IF we move up and if the breakout fails. If that happens than we will probably get confirmation if the price breaks the 7600ish. If we break the 7800 it should stay above the 7700 to confirm another move up. Not much more to say about what's going on.

487,1528359434.0,Taiwan_Bear,2618 (Double top & 0.618 pull-back) - do not miss it!!,"
In the last couple of TAs I have mentioned the “2618 pattern” and have been asked what 2618 means. Sorry for taking it so long as it took me quite a while to put everything altogether. But, as promised, I have explained below the rules and trade setups for the 2618 pattern.  

What are the rules/setups/steps for 2618?  
1.	Form a  double top  (Note #1)  
2.	Neckline has to be broken  
3.	After price found support at point (b), wait for pull back to 0.618 fib retracement of (a)(b)  
4.	After price retraced to 0.618, look for confluence and sell (eg. Structures,  trendlines  ,  double top  on a lower time frame,  rsi  divergence,  bearish pin bar  ,  inside bar  break down etc.) (Note #2)  
5.	Stop loss to be set above  double top 
6.	Set Take Profit levels (Note #3)  

Note #1 ( Double top ):  
The first step for the formation of 2618 is to form a  double top  at key resistance levels. Why at key resistance levels? Because we want to avoid fake double tops which can occur occasionally.  

There are some variations between various resources (books, websites) regarding the definitions of “double top”. The main differences occur where:  
a)	Some said for a  double top  to be valid, the wick of the 2nd top cannot exceed the wick of the 1st top; whereas, others said:  
b)	The wick of the 2nd top can exceed the wick of the 1st top but the candle close of the 2nd top CANNOT exceed the wick of the 1st top; or  
c)	The wick of the 2nd top can exceed the wick of the 1st top and the candle close of the 2nd top CAN exceed the wick of the 1st top; or  
d)	The wick of the 2nd top meets at least the candle close of the 1st top; or  
e)	The body of the 2nd top cannot exceed the body of the 1st top  

Personally, I would say all the above definitions work just fine although I do prefer definition a) because it means that the selling pressure is strong and the bulls fail to make a higher high. When there is a higher high formed in a downtrend, it can mean the downtrend has reversed and therefore you might not want to sell when the price pulls back to the 0.618 fib retracement.  

Note #2 ( 0.618 retracement ):  
When the price pulls back to 0.618, it does not mean to sell straight away. There must be more than one reason to sell other than the 0.618 retrace. The more reasons the better. In this example, you can see there are certainly structures (key resistance levels) at the 0.618 retrace. As well, there was a  double top  formed on the lower time frame. Consequently, you can sell.  

After  BTC -1.56%  hit the 0.618 retrace the first time, the price dropped from $9735 to $8650. but quickly bounced back to the 0.618 retrace level. That was a second & better opportunity to sell. Not only did  BTC -1.56%  form a  double top  on the larger time frame, but also with a  bearish  divergence on the 4hr time frame. Accordingly, you have more reasons to sell.  

Note #3 (Set take profit)  
Same as the rules of “Double top”, there are some variations as to which price level should you take profits. Personally, I would stick to the below:  
1)	First, take profit when risk/reward ratio hits 1:1 (recommend to take 30% - 50% profits and adjust the SL of the remaining positions to break-even)  
2)	When price hits the same price level as the low after the neckline is broken ((b) point in this example)  
3)	When price hits 1.272 fib extension of (a)(b)  
4)	When price hits point (d) (using  AB=CD  pattern. If you are not sure what the rules of  AB=CD  are, you can refer to my previous TA in which I have attached the link below)  
5)	If in a one-way market (heavily bearish/bullish), you can always keep 10% to 20% of your positions and take profits when risk/reward ratio hits 1:5 or even 1:10

 BTC -1.56%  is on the verge of breaking to a daily higher high on the bounce if the bulls can see a push this morning. 
If we reject from here the daily will form a lower high and we will see a tightening pattern within the highlighted  support and resistance  lines.  
Important for the bulls to show up or we could stay in this range into tomorrow.  
Healthy consolidation after the most recent bull move and the 15 min chart needs to change the trend.  
Also look to  EMA  12 support on the 4 hour and hourly.  
Another morning like yesterday with the bulls comfortable as worst case, we likely stay in the tightening pattern if bulls cannot prove themselves.

The current situation of  Bitcoin -1.58%  is quite difficult. We are on a clear treshold. A lot of traders are saying that we are on a clear downtrend, but the same amount of people are claiming that we will have our reversal soon. 

This article tries to sum up all important information you have to need! 

1: Retracement of a parabolic uptrend: 
There is a rule of thumb for the retracement of a parabolic uptrend. We should retrace to approx. the 0.786  Fibonacci Retracement  +/- 10%! 
Depending where we start the count, we are already in that target. Although both ways (blue and red) have still some space for a further downwave! 







2: The bloody support of Bitcoin: 
The average cost of mining one  bitcoin -1.58%  are at USA/Russia approx. 4700$ and at 3100$ for china! 
A drop below a target of 4700$ would be savage. Nevertheless, i can't image that we will hit that target. 







3: Manipulation of  Bitcoin -1.58%  and the Bart Simpson Pattern: 
A friend of mine found some unusual patterns in the orderbooks of several exchanges: 
https://twitter.com/CryptoSyndrome 
Altcoins are manipulated on a daily basis. It seems that  bitcoin -1.58%  is now affected to this too, which causes all these 3-5% pump and dumps. 
Thus, we are forming all the time the Bartin Simpsons Patterns. 

4: Similarity to 2014: 
Bitcoin -1.58%  now: 






Bitcoin -1.58%  2014: 







5: Deminishing downtrend and a strong support 
If we see the falling  wedges  as the force of the downtrend, then the force is diminishing! 
Furthermore we have strong support which is holding now for the 4th time! 







6: The Indicators 
Having a look at the indicators at 2D, we have a good potential for an upwave now. 
The  volume  is deminishing which should indicate a breakout soon. 
The  MACD  is about to cross, the  RSI  was slightly overbought and is heading up like the  Stoch .  RSI . 
The 200  EMA  is slighty under the current price and act as a support. 

7: The symetrical Triangle 
The theory says, that we should have in a  sym -1.72% . triangle 5 times an  ABC  wave. The waves are not perfect, but we can construct them. 






As you can see, the last four ABC-Waves formed always a 1:1 extention, which indicates that we have finished wave 5. 

8: A possible Head and Shoulders 
Even if this is not the most perfect  Head and Shoulders  Pattern, it's still valid! 
We are currently at the neckline, which is a strong and important resistance. Breaking upwards should indicate a good uptrend. 







9: The magic  6th 0.00%  of the month 






Suprisingly we have on every  6th 0.00%  of the month a reversal. Why is that??? 
One reason could be the  CME Group Futures  with dates for the settlements always nearby the  6th 0.00%  of the month! 
http://www.cmegroup.com 

10: Longterm  Bullish  TA 
The whole pattern could be seen as a big  bullish pennant . 







11: Shortterm  Bullish  TA 
Leading diagonal  starting wave1 of an  Elliott Wave , since we have now an impulse wave, after the 5x  ABC  pattern inside the triangle is finished. 
Our target should be at the top of the triangle nearby 8600-8800$. 







12: Longterm  Bearish  TA 
We also can argue, that we are currenty in an downtrend and the  sym -1.72% . triangle just continuing the trend. 
Our target should be nearby 6000$ which is also a finished downwards  Elliott Wave .

Nothing is happening in the market:  volatility  has become extinct and coins' trading fallen out of fashion. Range-bound bots and robotic humans absolutely prosper in this environment. The price was unable to break the 7700 threshold. For me this is a  bearish  signal. Indicators provide mixed signals, so let's examine wave structure. The move from May 29 is a  3-wave -0.12%  correction within a larger downtrend. A price drop below 7500 would confirm this scenario.

					Impulse Wave Truncation (Truncated Fifth) - 
Truncated 5th wave is when the market has become so over-extended in Wave 3 that there is not much force left for the impulse wave to come to a proper completion. So when this happens, there is a chance that the last wave of the impulse, Wave 5, will not reach the end of Wave 3 before the market starts correcting in the opposite direction. At this point, the market is just too exhausted. This condition is often called a “failure” or a “Truncation.”

I can see many people still believe that we are going inside a  descending triangle . I also believed this in my idea that i shard on may 1st: 



 

Things can change so quickly and if we didn't adapt to the changes then someone will. That's why i believe that we have to be in fast adapt mode in this market. Doesn't mean that you need to change without checking yourself. I try to find 2-3 confirmations before i change my idea on something. This includes pattern changes, trend changes etc 

There are 21 corrective wave patterns in EW which is categorized into major 3 corrective wave patterns: 

Zigzag  (5-3-5) 
Flat (3-3-5) 
Triangle (3-3-3-3-3) 

And other patterns are combinations of the above which is:  

Double three (A combination of two corrective patterns above) 
Triple three (A combination of three corrective patterns above) 

So what i can see now is that we are in two double three combination corrective wave pattern: 








More info here:  

https://elliottwave-forecast.com/elliott-wave-theory/#corrective-waves 

Confirmations: 

1. Wave ((i)) of C is 1.6k and ((v)) is going to be completed below the triangle 
2. Wave (E) of the triangle can't go beyond the triangle.  
3. This has happened twice before in 2013 & 2015 

Each wave  got 3 subwaves (a,b &c) inside and we are in the subwave c of ((y)) of Y which is an impulsive wave. 

Impulsive waves: 1,3,5,a,c 
Corrective waves: 2,4,b 

Normal Fibo Ratios for these waves are: 

wave 2 = 0.5 - 0.8 of wave 1  
wave 3 = 1.236 - 1.618 of wave 1  
wave 4 = 0.5 - 0.618 of wave 3  
wave 5 = 0.618 - 1 of wave 1  
wave B = 0.5 - 0.8 of wave A  
wave C = 0.618 - 1.236 of wave A  

Now if you check what happened in subwave a of ((y)) of Y you can see that: 

Wave (i) of a: 985$ 
Wave (ii) of a: 434$  
Wave ( iii -0.46% ) of a: 1207$  
Wave (iv) of a: 691$ [~0.618 of Wave ( iii -0.46% )] 
Wave (v) of a: 950$  








I have seen  BTC -1.52%  impulsive waves fibo ratios almost the same as the previous impulsive wave fibo ratios. 
Now if you apply the same for the last wave C of (E) this is what you get: 

Wave ((i)) of c: 1587$ 
Wave ((ii)) of c  = 793$ 
Wave (( iii -0.46% )) of c  = 1961$ 
Wave ((iv)) of c [~0.618 of Wave (( iii -0.46% ))] = 1212$ 
Wave ((v)) of c  = 1587$ 








Also note that Wave ((iv)) might not retrace upto 0.618 of Wave (( iii -0.46% )) as everyone will be in panic mode by that time so minimum retracement would be around 0.386 of Wave (( iii -0.46% )) which is around 756$ and this is why i can see it goes down to 5k level or little bit more towards 4.7k which is the lowest level of the  support zone  (orange dotted lines) 








So 3 Possible Support lines for reversal would be 

1. Blue: 5800 - 6100 (Only possible if Wave ((v)) is truncated) 
2. Orange: 4700 - 5000 (This is most likely where we heading)  
3. Red: 4100 - 4400 (Only possible if Wave (( iii -0.46% )) is extended)

As we can see in the chart above, a fall is followed by a rise. This has happened twice before and is expected to happen again now on the  6th 0.00%  of June, 2018. This time  Bitcoin -1.50%  will finish a  bearish  cycle and I expected to begin the next  bullish  cycle at least till the end of  6th 0.00%  of July, 2018. 

This pattern of rise and fall is also supported by other patterns on the chart that signal a  bullish  reversal. The support line has also held firmly and if this pattern of alternating rise and fall ensues,  Bitcoin -1.50%  could very well make new highs by the end of the year. The  RSI  is recovering from oversold levels and has now approached a normal.  Bitcoin -1.50%  is currently at a favorable point for  bullish  entries. The price broke a long term resistance as it break past the downtrend line in April, 2018. This was a big accomplishment for the bulls but the lack of confidence pulled the price back to the support line. Currently, the price is just above the support line and appears to be all set for a  bullish  comeback but the reality is, there are not enough bulls in the market. 

The past few months have been devastating for the price of  Bitcoin -1.50%  ( BTC -1.50% ) and a lot of investors are still running scared. Institutional investors are looking for more clarity regarding regulations concerning cryptocurrencies and also safer ways to invest and store their coins. As for retail investors, most of them comprise of first time investors who have never traded any financial asset before. So, when they saw that  Bitcoin -1.50%  ( BTC -1.50% ) is making 20% gains every day, they thought this could go on forever and jumped with both feet, only to find the carpet pulled under from their feet. Big investors have always played small investors as cannon fodder and have gotten away with their schemes even in regulated markets like forex or the stock market. Cryptocurrencies is a new market with no proper regulations which means it is natural to expect that those who can afford to not play by the rules, most likely won’t.

Hello friends,  

It's been a while since my last post; lack of time and an urge to do more research has mainly driven me to take a break from posting ideas on TradingView. I am still in the process of doing more research and study, but I figure posting once in a while couldn't hurt. 

Since I have become recently very convinced about this, I am outlining a very possible situation with  Bitcoin -1.46%  where the  trend line  we have been on since early October breaks, reaching around a temporary low of $5000. This is examined on the  daily chart , since this is one of the best charts to examine trends of this size. I have to first and foremost say that I am not trying to spread fear, I know many people do not like to hear  bearish  ideas, but  technical analysis  is ultimately a rational exercise, and I feel that possibilities with very strong signs should be explored. 

There are a few things to look at, but I first want to talk about the big picture with, long-term  support and resistance  lines. I think most people can agree that there was a very significant downtrending resistance line that began from the peak of the  ATH 0.63%  in late December, to the low of around $6400 (thick red line). After the break from that line, it seems we moved into a sideways trend, bouncing back and forth between an emerging downtrending resistance line (light red) and a support line that we seem to have been respecting since mid-October (light green); at least this appears to be the case with the lows, where the angle's effectiveness appears very strongly. Finally, based on previous bounces, we can establish a support of around $5000-$5300 (I've thus created a small  support zone  around that range, in dark green), as well as lower supports around $3200 and $2000 (though I do not believe these will be reached, in dark green).   

Now, onto the analysis - it's no secret that  Bitcoin -1.46%  has been squeezing in, ready for a significant move either upwards or downwards. Initially I considered the upwards move to be more likely due to the significant media attention cryptocurrency has been receiving, but after viewing previous market cycles of  Bitcoin -1.46%  (check 2013), it seems clear to me that the  bearish  scenario of closing in on the market cycle is very likely, and should at the very least be prepared for with proper risk management. According to Dow Theory, which is said to have laid the foundations of modern  technical analysis , history repeats itself, and this is a situation where we forced to consider this. 

Should we break from the line, we will likely fall straight down to the $5000-$5000 area, where we will shoot back up and bounce towards around $6700 or so (maybe a little less). From there one, we will likely enter a sideways trend, which we will continue until we see higher highs and higher lows and parabolic movement returns, which could lead to us challenging the all-time high, and hitting $35k-$50k. 

NOTE: I seem to have reached the max character limit for this section of the idea, so I will continue my text below.

Comment:
					Onto the short-term: 


Scenario A: 

The reason why I have drawn this movement into a pennant is this way, is simply because we have been moving through this ascending triangle for quite a while now (May 23rd to today). I don't think that the pattern will be sufficient to directly lead into a strong sell-off, but we should consider that the size of ascending triangle suggests a small movement downwards at the very least, which can create a higher low, and thus move into position into a bearish pennant. Why would a bearish pennant occur here and not have a bounce to $8500-$8700? The reason is in positioning - the huge downtrend (May 5th to May 26th) creates a very nice flagpole in which it hits around the $5000 area very perfectly, and thus I would not be surprised if this happens. 

Second reason: on the Stoch RSI indicator on the daily chart, it appears to be dangerously high, which would suggest it being oversold. For the most part, it seems to have called lows and highs, at least to some extent. This overdrawn movement may very well have increased the likelyhood of Bitcoin being oversold. This could suggest that this is the last step into a sharp downturn, but this does not preclude Situation B. Volume has also been steadily decreasing, but this is the case with any sort of consolidation, I believe. 

Finally, the lines I have drawn below the triangle are simply bounces that I think seem fairly reasonable. The length from to support to the lines correlate with the length of the flagpole, of course, though it may seem chopped off due to the huge line from the long-term support downwards. 


Scenario B: 

This is much simpler, Bitcoin hits the upper resistance line, bounces off, challenges the lower support line, and we potentially see a break, and the rest unfolds from there. 


----------------------------------------------------------------------- 


With all this being said, do not fear if you are hoping for more parabolic movement - this likely will not be the end, and will simply be the set up for a long, drawn out sideways movement until the first signs of bullish activity begin and we start all over again. If you are longing around here, please consider using risk management, prepare for every possibility. If you are shorting, the same applies. 

Please trade with care. I wish the best to all traders!

Comment:
					This really is a very minor note, but I just want to emphasize that the rising wedge (which I erroneously refer to as an ascending triangle, a bad habit I have) entering a bearish pennant is more based on intuition than anything. Also, this pennant is mainly based on the conservative assumption that the break will happen at 7900, if it happens at 7700 where we seem to be general resistance, the pennant would look something like this:

I am Mid term-bullish on  BTC -1.48%  going into the end of this week, but looking to get into the market on a pull back to occur before I get in to the market.  The jury is still out as to whether this weekly bear trend is ready to turn around.  

We can see that both the  RSI  and  MFI  are both  Bullish  on the daily having bottomed when reaching oversold on both at c. $7k support where we found our longer term  trend line . 

We are currently in the process of meeting the Tenkan (blue line) as I write this, so in the very short term, I am looking for a pull back to $7550 range for an entry.  One of the main reasons for this is that on the 4hour timeframes we are close to completing an edge to edge trade so the risk reward doesn’t fit my profile, however a break out from the cloud or above the Tenkan around $7777 will make me enter the market. 

The  RSI  and  MFI  have both been excellent indicators in this bear market.  Whenever  RSI  has gone above the 60 and the  MFI  80; its time to exit the market from a  bullish  trade and consider shorting as it progresses higher.   

Based on the  RSI ,  MFI  trends and the fact that we will run into the Kijun at just around $8-8.2k, I will be scalling out at this  bearish  confluence level to start looking for pull backs and reassessment as i believe it to be a key point as  

Best case scenario this trade would yield a 10% return before leverage. 
This is for illustrative purposes only, please DYOR and goodluck with your trading.

So the pullback trade that we were looking at worked out & has made it's way back to the neckline level of structure. We are now at what i like to call a ""decision point"" Essentially IF price is able to violate this current level od structure THEN we're likely to continue to our next price projection.  

Something that a lot of newer traders don't understand is that when it comes to bigger moves, the market will often provide multiple opportunities to get involved. For those who don't rush and for those who don't get discouraged. If you perform consistent analysis you can often find multiple ways to involve yourself in a trade even if you missed the first strike.

This is the way markets move, If you question my charting check my previous posts. Its as simple as pie. We are going down, How long and how far is too soon to say. Here is a chart that we can understand the future price action and where to buy back. Before you guys start blasting my comment section with the time and how it may not be right thats correct. I am not calculating the time I'm just making a technical drawing of the directions that we will see in the next few months.  

Recent price action has clear signs of wash trading / market manipulation fud and lots of nonsense. Its hard to prove almost impossible so as a trader we just need to deal with it. Ideally the situation you are supposed to trade are critical break up and break down points to enter the trade. Dont enter or exit dumb trades and lose money. As an experienced trader you should be looking for shorts, I would not consider a long unless we are over $10-12k

I am never good with words so instead of writing paragraphs of clarification to justify my call for SHORT since my last posting, I have explained everything on my chart with the least words possible using Fibonacci. It does not matter how popular  Bitcoin -1.51%  has become, or how deep it has disrupted the financial sector, or how many institutional investors have come to invest in it -- the psychology behind a market cycle does not change. 

I don't really encourage anyone to short  Bitcoin -1.51% , but in all honesty, don't expect the bulls to fly anytime soon. Like I said before, this correction that we are having right now is the ""MOTHER OF ALL CORRECTIONS"" after a 4-year-long bull cycle since the 2013 correction... and we are just halfway through.

My best idea ever, taking some time off the last 2 days :) The whales just continue to play their little games by squeezing leveraged short and long positions out of the market. Can't play them, it's just too easy. Maybe it's time we retail traders stand together, combine our  volume  and use their own game against them. Yeah, maybe we could even make a blockbuster movie about this :) I love me some science fiction :) LOL  

My last update of the previous analysis i showed 2 important support levels where the price could bounce up from. The first support around 7350 did the trick and the price got pushed back to 7700. From that point on i told my members that i thought i was seeing distribution, but it was still very confusing to figure out what was going on. TA was showing  bullish  signs, that  bull flag  was very strong and was even turning slowly up and was about to squeeze upwards. But of course out of no where the price got dumped, the move we saw a few hours ago. After that 200 point drop the price got pushed up again to 7700 like that dump was a glitch. If your a whale, why not push out leveraged traders and take your money while your accumulating or distributing. It's like a bonus, like the cherry on top :)  

Anyway, in this chart we can see allot of similarities of what is going on. As you know i have been saying i am still  bearish  for the medium term, but i just could not say what was going to happen on the short term. 2 days ago after we finally dropped out of that  wedge , i said we would have 2 options.  
- Break those 2 support levels from the last update of my previous chart (73xx and 71xx) 
- Make a higher low at those same support levels and make another move up above the high.  
 
As we can see in the chart, the  fractal  is not 100% identical so it's no guarantee that the 7700 high we just saw is the high already and that we start to move down. But based on this  fractal , i don't want to see the price get above the 7800/7900. This  fractal  confirms my  bearish  view as well. That's why TA is so great, you can turn any chart to fit your view :). 

Even without this  fractal , i just give it a very small chance that 7K price action is the fundament of a low to start another bull rally, i just highly doubt that. I want to see more  volume  to begin with and at least  double bottom  kind of formation. So the minimum i expect is a test of the 7100/6900in the coming week or 2. But the movement i have in mind for the med term is a drop below the 7K to form a big V shape low. If we get to see that, than i might even become  bullish  for the rest of the year :).  

As long as the price stays above the 73xx, we have to assume the bulls are still in control and we should see another wave up. So for me the 73xx is an important turning point.

					This is my bigger picture, think this bearish triangle is still 100% in play. I think if bulls can't break the 7800/7900 the bearish version is probably going to happen. Can't say HOW it will go, this blue line is just a guess. But a big V shape low would be the most bullish for the long term. I still think we are seeing distribution here. The only way this idea can be countered, is through a big increase of buying volume, if that doesn't happen, i think it's only a matter of time.

The price took a small dump but the volume was low so no real read on what the intent was. So we might see another move up, if we start to see a small pump that takes out the 7800, be aware of a fake breakout. The blue line is a possibility of what the move could look like IF we move up and if the breakout fails. If that happens than we will probably get confirmation if the price breaks the 7600ish. If we break the 7800 it should stay above the 7700 to confirm another move up. Not much more to say about what's going on.

505,1528359434.0,Taiwan_Bear,2618 (Double top & 0.618 pull-back) - do not miss it!!,"
In the last couple of TAs I have mentioned the “2618 pattern” and have been asked what 2618 means. Sorry for taking it so long as it took me quite a while to put everything altogether. But, as promised, I have explained below the rules and trade setups for the 2618 pattern.  

What are the rules/setups/steps for 2618?  
1.	Form a  double top  (Note #1)  
2.	Neckline has to be broken  
3.	After price found support at point (b), wait for pull back to 0.618 fib retracement of (a)(b)  
4.	After price retraced to 0.618, look for confluence and sell (eg. Structures,  trendlines  ,  double top  on a lower time frame,  rsi  divergence,  bearish pin bar  ,  inside bar  break down etc.) (Note #2)  
5.	Stop loss to be set above  double top 
6.	Set Take Profit levels (Note #3)  

Note #1 ( Double top ):  
The first step for the formation of 2618 is to form a  double top  at key resistance levels. Why at key resistance levels? Because we want to avoid fake double tops which can occur occasionally.  

There are some variations between various resources (books, websites) regarding the definitions of “double top”. The main differences occur where:  
a)	Some said for a  double top  to be valid, the wick of the 2nd top cannot exceed the wick of the 1st top; whereas, others said:  
b)	The wick of the 2nd top can exceed the wick of the 1st top but the candle close of the 2nd top CANNOT exceed the wick of the 1st top; or  
c)	The wick of the 2nd top can exceed the wick of the 1st top and the candle close of the 2nd top CAN exceed the wick of the 1st top; or  
d)	The wick of the 2nd top meets at least the candle close of the 1st top; or  
e)	The body of the 2nd top cannot exceed the body of the 1st top  

Personally, I would say all the above definitions work just fine although I do prefer definition a) because it means that the selling pressure is strong and the bulls fail to make a higher high. When there is a higher high formed in a downtrend, it can mean the downtrend has reversed and therefore you might not want to sell when the price pulls back to the 0.618 fib retracement.  

Note #2 ( 0.618 retracement ):  
When the price pulls back to 0.618, it does not mean to sell straight away. There must be more than one reason to sell other than the 0.618 retrace. The more reasons the better. In this example, you can see there are certainly structures (key resistance levels) at the 0.618 retrace. As well, there was a  double top  formed on the lower time frame. Consequently, you can sell.  

After  BTC -1.51%  hit the 0.618 retrace the first time, the price dropped from $9735 to $8650. but quickly bounced back to the 0.618 retrace level. That was a second & better opportunity to sell. Not only did  BTC -1.51%  form a  double top  on the larger time frame, but also with a  bearish  divergence on the 4hr time frame. Accordingly, you have more reasons to sell.  

Note #3 (Set take profit)  
Same as the rules of “Double top”, there are some variations as to which price level should you take profits. Personally, I would stick to the below:  
1)	First, take profit when risk/reward ratio hits 1:1 (recommend to take 30% - 50% profits and adjust the SL of the remaining positions to break-even)  
2)	When price hits the same price level as the low after the neckline is broken ((b) point in this example)  
3)	When price hits 1.272 fib extension of (a)(b)  
4)	When price hits point (d) (using  AB=CD  pattern. If you are not sure what the rules of  AB=CD  are, you can refer to my previous TA in which I have attached the link below)  
5)	If in a one-way market (heavily bearish/bullish), you can always keep 10% to 20% of your positions and take profits when risk/reward ratio hits 1:5 or even 1:10

 BTC -1.51%  is on the verge of breaking to a daily higher high on the bounce if the bulls can see a push this morning. 
If we reject from here the daily will form a lower high and we will see a tightening pattern within the highlighted  support and resistance  lines.  
Important for the bulls to show up or we could stay in this range into tomorrow.  
Healthy consolidation after the most recent bull move and the 15 min chart needs to change the trend.  
Also look to  EMA  12 support on the 4 hour and hourly.  
Another morning like yesterday with the bulls comfortable as worst case, we likely stay in the tightening pattern if bulls cannot prove themselves.

The current situation of  Bitcoin -1.51%  is quite difficult. We are on a clear treshold. A lot of traders are saying that we are on a clear downtrend, but the same amount of people are claiming that we will have our reversal soon. 

This article tries to sum up all important information you have to need! 

1: Retracement of a parabolic uptrend: 
There is a rule of thumb for the retracement of a parabolic uptrend. We should retrace to approx. the 0.786  Fibonacci Retracement  +/- 10%! 
Depending where we start the count, we are already in that target. Although both ways (blue and red) have still some space for a further downwave! 







2: The bloody support of Bitcoin: 
The average cost of mining one  bitcoin -1.51%  are at USA/Russia approx. 4700$ and at 3100$ for china! 
A drop below a target of 4700$ would be savage. Nevertheless, i can't image that we will hit that target. 







3: Manipulation of  Bitcoin -1.51%  and the Bart Simpson Pattern: 
A friend of mine found some unusual patterns in the orderbooks of several exchanges: 
https://twitter.com/CryptoSyndrome 
Altcoins are manipulated on a daily basis. It seems that  bitcoin -1.51%  is now affected to this too, which causes all these 3-5% pump and dumps. 
Thus, we are forming all the time the Bartin Simpsons Patterns. 

4: Similarity to 2014: 
Bitcoin -1.51%  now: 






Bitcoin -1.51%  2014: 







5: Deminishing downtrend and a strong support 
If we see the falling  wedges  as the force of the downtrend, then the force is diminishing! 
Furthermore we have strong support which is holding now for the 4th time! 







6: The Indicators 
Having a look at the indicators at 2D, we have a good potential for an upwave now. 
The  volume  is deminishing which should indicate a breakout soon. 
The  MACD  is about to cross, the  RSI  was slightly overbought and is heading up like the  Stoch .  RSI . 
The 200  EMA  is slighty under the current price and act as a support. 

7: The symetrical Triangle 
The theory says, that we should have in a  sym -0.80% . triangle 5 times an  ABC  wave. The waves are not perfect, but we can construct them. 






As you can see, the last four ABC-Waves formed always a 1:1 extention, which indicates that we have finished wave 5. 

8: A possible Head and Shoulders 
Even if this is not the most perfect  Head and Shoulders  Pattern, it's still valid! 
We are currently at the neckline, which is a strong and important resistance. Breaking upwards should indicate a good uptrend. 







9: The magic  6th 0.00%  of the month 






Suprisingly we have on every  6th 0.00%  of the month a reversal. Why is that??? 
One reason could be the  CME Group Futures  with dates for the settlements always nearby the  6th 0.00%  of the month!

10: Longterm  Bullish  TA 
The whole pattern could be seen as a big  bullish pennant . 







11: Shortterm  Bullish  TA 
Leading diagonal  starting wave1 of an  Elliott Wave , since we have now an impulse wave, after the 5x  ABC  pattern inside the triangle is finished. 
Our target should be at the top of the triangle nearby 8600-8800$. 







12: Longterm  Bearish  TA 
We also can argue, that we are currenty in an downtrend and the  sym -0.80% . triangle just continuing the trend. 
Our target should be nearby 6000$ which is also a finished downwards  Elliott Wave .

Nothing is happening in the market:  volatility  has become extinct and coins' trading fallen out of fashion. Range-bound bots and robotic humans absolutely prosper in this environment. The price was unable to break the 7700 threshold. For me this is a  bearish  signal. Indicators provide mixed signals, so let's examine wave structure. The move from May 29 is a  3-wave -0.12%  correction within a larger downtrend. A price drop below 7500 would confirm this scenario.

					Impulse Wave Truncation (Truncated Fifth) - 
Truncated 5th wave is when the market has become so over-extended in Wave 3 that there is not much force left for the impulse wave to come to a proper completion. So when this happens, there is a chance that the last wave of the impulse, Wave 5, will not reach the end of Wave 3 before the market starts correcting in the opposite direction. At this point, the market is just too exhausted. This condition is often called a “failure” or a “Truncation.”

I can see many people still believe that we are going inside a  descending triangle . I also believed this in my idea that i shard on may 1st: 



 

Things can change so quickly and if we didn't adapt to the changes then someone will. That's why i believe that we have to be in fast adapt mode in this market. Doesn't mean that you need to change without checking yourself. I try to find 2-3 confirmations before i change my idea on something. This includes pattern changes, trend changes etc 

There are 21 corrective wave patterns in EW which is categorized into major 3 corrective wave patterns: 

Zigzag  (5-3-5) 
Flat (3-3-5) 
Triangle (3-3-3-3-3) 

And other patterns are combinations of the above which is:  

Double three (A combination of two corrective patterns above) 
Triple three (A combination of three corrective patterns above) 

So what i can see now is that we are in two double three combination corrective wave pattern: 








More info here:  

https://elliottwave-forecast.com/elliott-wave-theory/#corrective-waves 

Confirmations: 

1. Wave ((i)) of C is 1.6k and ((v)) is going to be completed below the triangle 
2. Wave (E) of the triangle can't go beyond the triangle.  
3. This has happened twice before in 2013 & 2015 

Each wave  got 3 subwaves (a,b &c) inside and we are in the subwave c of ((y)) of Y which is an impulsive wave. 

Impulsive waves: 1,3,5,a,c 
Corrective waves: 2,4,b 

Normal Fibo Ratios for these waves are: 

wave 2 = 0.5 - 0.8 of wave 1  
wave 3 = 1.236 - 1.618 of wave 1  
wave 4 = 0.5 - 0.618 of wave 3  
wave 5 = 0.618 - 1 of wave 1  
wave B = 0.5 - 0.8 of wave A  
wave C = 0.618 - 1.236 of wave A  

Now if you check what happened in subwave a of ((y)) of Y you can see that: 

Wave (i) of a: 985$ 
Wave (ii) of a: 434$  
Wave ( iii -0.46% ) of a: 1207$  
Wave (iv) of a: 691$ [~0.618 of Wave ( iii -0.46% )] 
Wave (v) of a: 950$  








I have seen  BTC -1.51%  impulsive waves fibo ratios almost the same as the previous impulsive wave fibo ratios. 
Now if you apply the same for the last wave C of (E) this is what you get: 

Wave ((i)) of c: 1587$ 
Wave ((ii)) of c  = 793$ 
Wave (( iii -0.46% )) of c  = 1961$ 
Wave ((iv)) of c [~0.618 of Wave (( iii -0.46% ))] = 1212$ 
Wave ((v)) of c  = 1587$ 








Also note that Wave ((iv)) might not retrace upto 0.618 of Wave (( iii -0.46% )) as everyone will be in panic mode by that time so minimum retracement would be around 0.386 of Wave (( iii -0.46% )) which is around 756$ and this is why i can see it goes down to 5k level or little bit more towards 4.7k which is the lowest level of the  support zone  (orange dotted lines) 








So 3 Possible Support lines for reversal would be 

1. Blue: 5800 - 6100 (Only possible if Wave ((v)) is truncated) 
2. Orange: 4700 - 5000 (This is most likely where we heading)  
3. Red: 4100 - 4400 (Only possible if Wave (( iii -0.46% )) is extended)

 Bitcoin -1.53%  has recently developed an interesting pattern of completing a  bullish  and  bearish  cycle on the sixth of every month in an alternating order. As we can see in the chart above, a fall is followed by a rise. This has happened twice before and is expected to happen again now on the  6th 0.00%  of June, 2018. This time  Bitcoin -1.53%  will finish a  bearish  cycle and I expected to begin the next  bullish  cycle at least till the end of  6th 0.00%  of July, 2018. 

This pattern of rise and fall is also supported by other patterns on the chart that signal a  bullish  reversal. The support line has also held firmly and if this pattern of alternating rise and fall ensues,  Bitcoin -1.53%  could very well make new highs by the end of the year. The  RSI  is recovering from oversold levels and has now approached a normal.  Bitcoin -1.53%  is currently at a favorable point for  bullish  entries. The price broke a long term resistance as it break past the downtrend line in April, 2018. This was a big accomplishment for the bulls but the lack of confidence pulled the price back to the support line. Currently, the price is just above the support line and appears to be all set for a  bullish  comeback but the reality is, there are not enough bulls in the market. 

The past few months have been devastating for the price of  Bitcoin -1.53%  ( BTC -1.53% ) and a lot of investors are still running scared. Institutional investors are looking for more clarity regarding regulations concerning cryptocurrencies and also safer ways to invest and store their coins. As for retail investors, most of them comprise of first time investors who have never traded any financial asset before. So, when they saw that  Bitcoin -1.53%  ( BTC -1.53% ) is making 20% gains every day, they thought this could go on forever and jumped with both feet, only to find the carpet pulled under from their feet. Big investors have always played small investors as cannon fodder and have gotten away with their schemes even in regulated markets like forex or the stock market. Cryptocurrencies is a new market with no proper regulations which means it is natural to expect that those who can afford to not play by the rules, most likely won’t.

Hello friends,  

It's been a while since my last post; lack of time and an urge to do more research has mainly driven me to take a break from posting ideas on TradingView. I am still in the process of doing more research and study, but I figure posting once in a while couldn't hurt. 

Since I have become recently very convinced about this, I am outlining a very possible situation with  Bitcoin -1.53%  where the  trend line  we have been on since early October breaks, reaching around a temporary low of $5000. This is examined on the  daily chart , since this is one of the best charts to examine trends of this size. I have to first and foremost say that I am not trying to spread fear, I know many people do not like to hear  bearish  ideas, but  technical analysis  is ultimately a rational exercise, and I feel that possibilities with very strong signs should be explored. 

There are a few things to look at, but I first want to talk about the big picture with, long-term  support and resistance  lines. I think most people can agree that there was a very significant downtrending resistance line that began from the peak of the  ATH 0.63%  in late December, to the low of around $6400 (thick red line). After the break from that line, it seems we moved into a sideways trend, bouncing back and forth between an emerging downtrending resistance line (light red) and a support line that we seem to have been respecting since mid-October (light green); at least this appears to be the case with the lows, where the angle's effectiveness appears very strongly. Finally, based on previous bounces, we can establish a support of around $5000-$5300 (I've thus created a small  support zone  around that range, in dark green), as well as lower supports around $3200 and $2000 (though I do not believe these will be reached, in dark green).   

Now, onto the analysis - it's no secret that  Bitcoin -1.53%  has been squeezing in, ready for a significant move either upwards or downwards. Initially I considered the upwards move to be more likely due to the significant media attention cryptocurrency has been receiving, but after viewing previous market cycles of  Bitcoin -1.53%  (check 2013), it seems clear to me that the  bearish  scenario of closing in on the market cycle is very likely, and should at the very least be prepared for with proper risk management. According to Dow Theory, which is said to have laid the foundations of modern  technical analysis , history repeats itself, and this is a situation where we forced to consider this. 

Should we break from the line, we will likely fall straight down to the $5000-$5000 area, where we will shoot back up and bounce towards around $6700 or so (maybe a little less). From there one, we will likely enter a sideways trend, which we will continue until we see higher highs and higher lows and parabolic movement returns, which could lead to us challenging the all-time high, and hitting $35k-$50k. 

NOTE: I seem to have reached the max character limit for this section of the idea, so I will continue my text below.

Comment:
					Onto the short-term: 


Scenario A: 

The reason why I have drawn this movement into a pennant is this way, is simply because we have been moving through this ascending triangle for quite a while now (May 23rd to today). I don't think that the pattern will be sufficient to directly lead into a strong sell-off, but we should consider that the size of ascending triangle suggests a small movement downwards at the very least, which can create a higher low, and thus move into position into a bearish pennant. Why would a bearish pennant occur here and not have a bounce to $8500-$8700? The reason is in positioning - the huge downtrend (May 5th to May 26th) creates a very nice flagpole in which it hits around the $5000 area very perfectly, and thus I would not be surprised if this happens. 

Second reason: on the Stoch RSI indicator on the daily chart, it appears to be dangerously high, which would suggest it being oversold. For the most part, it seems to have called lows and highs, at least to some extent. This overdrawn movement may very well have increased the likelyhood of Bitcoin being oversold. This could suggest that this is the last step into a sharp downturn, but this does not preclude Situation B. Volume has also been steadily decreasing, but this is the case with any sort of consolidation, I believe. 

Finally, the lines I have drawn below the triangle are simply bounces that I think seem fairly reasonable. The length from to support to the lines correlate with the length of the flagpole, of course, though it may seem chopped off due to the huge line from the long-term support downwards. 


Scenario B: 

This is much simpler, Bitcoin hits the upper resistance line, bounces off, challenges the lower support line, and we potentially see a break, and the rest unfolds from there. 


----------------------------------------------------------------------- 


With all this being said, do not fear if you are hoping for more parabolic movement - this likely will not be the end, and will simply be the set up for a long, drawn out sideways movement until the first signs of bullish activity begin and we start all over again. If you are longing around here, please consider using risk management, prepare for every possibility. If you are shorting, the same applies. 

Please trade with care. I wish the best to all traders!

Comment:
					This really is a very minor note, but I just want to emphasize that the rising wedge (which I erroneously refer to as an ascending triangle, a bad habit I have) entering a bearish pennant is more based on intuition than anything. Also, this pennant is mainly based on the conservative assumption that the break will happen at 7900, if it happens at 7700 where we seem to be general resistance, the pennant would look something like this:

Jun 7




I am Mid term-bullish on  BTC -1.53%  going into the end of this week, but looking to get into the market on a pull back to occur before I get in to the market.  The jury is still out as to whether this weekly bear trend is ready to turn around.  

We can see that both the  RSI  and  MFI  are both  Bullish  on the daily having bottomed when reaching oversold on both at c. $7k support where we found our longer term  trend line . 

We are currently in the process of meeting the Tenkan (blue line) as I write this, so in the very short term, I am looking for a pull back to $7550 range for an entry.  One of the main reasons for this is that on the 4hour timeframes we are close to completing an edge to edge trade so the risk reward doesn’t fit my profile, however a break out from the cloud or above the Tenkan around $7777 will make me enter the market. 

The  RSI  and  MFI  have both been excellent indicators in this bear market.  Whenever  RSI  has gone above the 60 and the  MFI  80; its time to exit the market from a  bullish  trade and consider shorting as it progresses higher.   

Based on the  RSI ,  MFI  trends and the fact that we will run into the Kijun at just around $8-8.2k, I will be scalling out at this  bearish  confluence level to start looking for pull backs and reassessment as i believe it to be a key point as  

Best case scenario this trade would yield a 10% return before leverage. 
This is for illustrative purposes only, please DYOR and goodluck with your trading.

So the pullback trade that we were looking at worked out & has made it's way back to the neckline level of structure. We are now at what i like to call a ""decision point"" Essentially IF price is able to violate this current level od structure THEN we're likely to continue to our next price projection.  

Something that a lot of newer traders don't understand is that when it comes to bigger moves, the market will often provide multiple opportunities to get involved. For those who don't rush and for those who don't get discouraged. If you perform consistent analysis you can often find multiple ways to involve yourself in a trade even if you missed the first strike.

Recent price action has clear signs of wash trading / market manipulation fud and lots of nonsense. Its hard to prove almost impossible so as a trader we just need to deal with it.

I don't really encourage anyone to short  Bitcoin -1.55% , but in all honesty, don't expect the bulls to fly anytime soon.

My best idea ever, taking some time off the last 2 days :) The whales just continue to play their little games by squeezing leveraged short and long positions out of the market. Can't play them, it's just too easy. Maybe it's time we retail traders stand together, combine our  volume  and use their own game against them. Yeah, maybe we could even make a blockbuster movie about this :) I love me some science fiction :) LOL  

My last update of the previous analysis i showed 2 important support levels where the price could bounce up from. The first support around 7350 did the trick and the price got pushed back to 7700. From that point on i told my members that i thought i was seeing distribution, but it was still very confusing to figure out what was going on. TA was showing  bullish  signs, that  bull flag  was very strong and was even turning slowly up and was about to squeeze upwards. But of course out of no where the price got dumped, the move we saw a few hours ago. After that 200 point drop the price got pushed up again to 7700 like that dump was a glitch. If your a whale, why not push out leveraged traders and take your money while your accumulating or distributing. It's like a bonus, like the cherry on top :)  

Anyway, in this chart we can see allot of similarities of what is going on. As you know i have been saying i am still  bearish  for the medium term, but i just could not say what was going to happen on the short term. 2 days ago after we finally dropped out of that  wedge , i said we would have 2 options.  
- Break those 2 support levels from the last update of my previous chart (73xx and 71xx) 
- Make a higher low at those same support levels and make another move up above the high.  
 
As we can see in the chart, the  fractal  is not 100% identical so it's no guarantee that the 7700 high we just saw is the high already and that we start to move down. But based on this  fractal , i don't want to see the price get above the 7800/7900. This  fractal  confirms my  bearish  view as well. That's why TA is so great, you can turn any chart to fit your view :). 

Even without this  fractal , i just give it a very small chance that 7K price action is the fundament of a low to start another bull rally, i just highly doubt that. I want to see more  volume  to begin with and at least  double bottom  kind of formation. So the minimum i expect is a test of the 7100/6900in the coming week or 2. But the movement i have in mind for the med term is a drop below the 7K to form a big V shape low. If we get to see that, than i might even become  bullish  for the rest of the year :).  

As long as the price stays above the 73xx, we have to assume the bulls are still in control and we should see another wave up. So for me the 73xx is an important turning point.

					At the moment it looks like bulls are trying to push higher, this bull flag/triangle is still very strong. So no sign of weakness yet! First small sign would be a drop below 7620/7600. Bulls need to break 7700

					Another fractal i made a few days ago on IOTA, was almost 100% perfect, but it made one last small rally towards 2.03 before making that identical dump.

Comment:
					This is my bigger picture, think this bearish triangle is still 100% in play. I think if bulls can't break the 7800/7900 the bearish version is probably going to happen. Can't say HOW it will go, this blue line is just a guess. But a big V shape low would be the most bullish for the long term. I still think we are seeing distribution here. The only way this idea can be countered, is through a big increase of buying volume, if that doesn't happen, i think it's only a matter of time.

					Lower time frame we can see a new upwards channel and maybe even a rising wedge. From the looks of it, it's slowly going down to test the support line again. Depending on what will happen there we can make a better prediction for the rest of the day.

					What a surprise, nothing has changed :) 

The price took a small dump but the volume was low so no real read on what the intent was. So we might see another move up, if we start to see a small pump that takes out the 7800, be aware of a fake breakout. The blue line is a possibility of what the move could look like IF we move up and if the breakout fails. If that happens than we will probably get confirmation if the price breaks the 7600ish. If we break the 7800 it should stay above the 7700 to confirm another move up. Not much more to say about what's going on.

523,1528359434.0,Taiwan_Bear,2618 (Double top & 0.618 pull-back) - do not miss it!!,"
In the last couple of TAs I have mentioned the “2618 pattern” and have been asked what 2618 means. Sorry for taking it so long as it took me quite a while to put everything altogether. But, as promised, I have explained below the rules and trade setups for the 2618 pattern.  

What are the rules/setups/steps for 2618?  
1.	Form a  double top  (Note #1)  
2.	Neckline has to be broken  
3.	After price found support at point (b), wait for pull back to 0.618 fib retracement of (a)(b)  
4.	After price retraced to 0.618, look for confluence and sell (eg. Structures,  trendlines  ,  double top  on a lower time frame,  rsi  divergence,  bearish pin bar  ,  inside bar  break down etc.) (Note #2)  
5.	Stop loss to be set above  double top 
6.	Set Take Profit levels (Note #3)  

Note #1 ( Double top ):  
The first step for the formation of 2618 is to form a  double top  at key resistance levels. Why at key resistance levels? Because we want to avoid fake double tops which can occur occasionally.  

There are some variations between various resources (books, websites) regarding the definitions of “double top”. The main differences occur where:  
a)	Some said for a  double top  to be valid, the wick of the 2nd top cannot exceed the wick of the 1st top; whereas, others said:  
b)	The wick of the 2nd top can exceed the wick of the 1st top but the candle close of the 2nd top CANNOT exceed the wick of the 1st top; or  
c)	The wick of the 2nd top can exceed the wick of the 1st top and the candle close of the 2nd top CAN exceed the wick of the 1st top; or  
d)	The wick of the 2nd top meets at least the candle close of the 1st top; or  
e)	The body of the 2nd top cannot exceed the body of the 1st top  

Personally, I would say all the above definitions work just fine although I do prefer definition a) because it means that the selling pressure is strong and the bulls fail to make a higher high. When there is a higher high formed in a downtrend, it can mean the downtrend has reversed and therefore you might not want to sell when the price pulls back to the 0.618 fib retracement.  

Note #2 ( 0.618 retracement ):  
When the price pulls back to 0.618, it does not mean to sell straight away. There must be more than one reason to sell other than the 0.618 retrace. The more reasons the better. In this example, you can see there are certainly structures (key resistance levels) at the 0.618 retrace. As well, there was a  double top  formed on the lower time frame. Consequently, you can sell.  

After  BTC -1.55%  hit the 0.618 retrace the first time, the price dropped from $9735 to $8650. but quickly bounced back to the 0.618 retrace level. That was a second & better opportunity to sell. Not only did  BTC -1.55%  form a  double top  on the larger time frame, but also with a  bearish  divergence on the 4hr time frame. Accordingly, you have more reasons to sell.  

Note #3 (Set take profit)  
Same as the rules of “Double top”, there are some variations as to which price level should you take profits. Personally, I would stick to the below:  
1)	First, take profit when risk/reward ratio hits 1:1 (recommend to take 30% - 50% profits and adjust the SL of the remaining positions to break-even)  
2)	When price hits the same price level as the low after the neckline is broken ((b) point in this example)  
3)	When price hits 1.272 fib extension of (a)(b)  
4)	When price hits point (d) (using  AB=CD  pattern. If you are not sure what the rules of  AB=CD  are, you can refer to my previous TA in which I have attached the link below)  
5)	If in a one-way market (heavily bearish/bullish), you can always keep 10% to 20% of your positions and take profits when risk/reward ratio hits 1:5 or even 1:10

 BTC -1.55%  is on the verge of breaking to a daily higher high on the bounce if the bulls can see a push this morning. 
If we reject from here the daily will form a lower high and we will see a tightening pattern within the highlighted  support and resistance  lines.  
Important for the bulls to show up or we could stay in this range into tomorrow.  
Healthy consolidation after the most recent bull move and the 15 min chart needs to change the trend.  
Also look to  EMA  12 support on the 4 hour and hourly.  
Another morning like yesterday with the bulls comfortable as worst case, we likely stay in the tightening pattern if bulls cannot prove themselves.

The current situation of  Bitcoin -1.55%  is quite difficult. We are on a clear treshold. A lot of traders are saying that we are on a clear downtrend, but the same amount of people are claiming that we will have our reversal soon. 

This article tries to sum up all important information you have to need! 

1: Retracement of a parabolic uptrend: 
There is a rule of thumb for the retracement of a parabolic uptrend. We should retrace to approx. the 0.786  Fibonacci Retracement  +/- 10%! 
Depending where we start the count, we are already in that target. Although both ways (blue and red) have still some space for a further downwave! 







2: The bloody support of Bitcoin: 
The average cost of mining one  bitcoin -1.55%  are at USA/Russia approx. 4700$ and at 3100$ for china! 
A drop below a target of 4700$ would be savage. Nevertheless, i can't image that we will hit that target. 







3: Manipulation of  Bitcoin -1.55%  and the Bart Simpson Pattern: 
A friend of mine found some unusual patterns in the orderbooks of several exchanges: 
https://twitter.com/CryptoSyndrome 
Altcoins are manipulated on a daily basis. It seems that  bitcoin -1.55%  is now affected to this too, which causes all these 3-5% pump and dumps. 
Thus, we are forming all the time the Bartin Simpsons Patterns. 

4: Similarity to 2014: 
Bitcoin -1.55%  now: 






Bitcoin -1.55%  2014: 







5: Deminishing downtrend and a strong support 
If we see the falling  wedges  as the force of the downtrend, then the force is diminishing! 
Furthermore we have strong support which is holding now for the 4th time! 







6: The Indicators 
Having a look at the indicators at 2D, we have a good potential for an upwave now. 
The  volume  is deminishing which should indicate a breakout soon. 
The  MACD  is about to cross, the  RSI  was slightly overbought and is heading up like the  Stoch .  RSI . 
The 200  EMA  is slighty under the current price and act as a support. 

7: The symetrical Triangle 
The theory says, that we should have in a  sym -1.72% . triangle 5 times an  ABC  wave. The waves are not perfect, but we can construct them. 






As you can see, the last four ABC-Waves formed always a 1:1 extention, which indicates that we have finished wave 5. 

8: A possible Head and Shoulders 
Even if this is not the most perfect  Head and Shoulders  Pattern, it's still valid! 
We are currently at the neckline, which is a strong and important resistance. Breaking upwards should indicate a good uptrend. 







9: The magic  6th 0.00%  of the month 






Suprisingly we have on every  6th 0.00%  of the month a reversal. Why is that??? 
One reason could be the  CME Group Futures  with dates for the settlements always nearby the  6th 0.00%  of the month! 
http://www.cmegroup.com 

10: Longterm  Bullish  TA 
The whole pattern could be seen as a big  bullish pennant . 







11: Shortterm  Bullish  TA 
Leading diagonal  starting wave1 of an  Elliott Wave , since we have now an impulse wave, after the 5x  ABC  pattern inside the triangle is finished. 
Our target should be at the top of the triangle nearby 8600-8800$. 







12: Longterm  Bearish  TA 
We also can argue, that we are currenty in an downtrend and the  sym -1.72% . triangle just continuing the trend. 
Our target should be nearby 6000$ which is also a finished downwards  Elliott Wave .

Nothing is happening in the market:  volatility  has become extinct and coins' trading fallen out of fashion. Range-bound bots and robotic humans absolutely prosper in this environment. The price was unable to break the 7700 threshold. For me this is a  bearish  signal. Indicators provide mixed signals, so let's examine wave structure. The move from May 29 is a  3-wave -0.12%  correction within a larger downtrend. A price drop below 7500 would confirm this scenario.

Comment:
					Impulse Wave Truncation (Truncated Fifth) - 
Truncated 5th wave is when the market has become so over-extended in Wave 3 that there is not much force left for the impulse wave to come to a proper completion. So when this happens, there is a chance that the last wave of the impulse, Wave 5, will not reach the end of Wave 3 before the market starts correcting in the opposite direction. At this point, the market is just too exhausted. This condition is often called a “failure” or a “Truncation.”

I can see many people still believe that we are going inside a  descending triangle . I also believed this in my idea that i shard on may 1st: 



 

Things can change so quickly and if we didn't adapt to the changes then someone will. That's why i believe that we have to be in fast adapt mode in this market. Doesn't mean that you need to change without checking yourself. I try to find 2-3 confirmations before i change my idea on something. This includes pattern changes, trend changes etc 

There are 21 corrective wave patterns in EW which is categorized into major 3 corrective wave patterns: 

Zigzag  (5-3-5) 
Flat (3-3-5) 
Triangle (3-3-3-3-3) 

And other patterns are combinations of the above which is:  

Double three (A combination of two corrective patterns above) 
Triple three (A combination of three corrective patterns above) 

So what i can see now is that we are in two double three combination corrective wave pattern: 








More info here:  

https://elliottwave-forecast.com/elliott-wave-theory/#corrective-waves 

Confirmations: 

1. Wave ((i)) of C is 1.6k and ((v)) is going to be completed below the triangle 
2. Wave (E) of the triangle can't go beyond the triangle.  
3. This has happened twice before in 2013 & 2015 

Each wave  got 3 subwaves (a,b &c) inside and we are in the subwave c of ((y)) of Y which is an impulsive wave. 

Impulsive waves: 1,3,5,a,c 
Corrective waves: 2,4,b 

Normal Fibo Ratios for these waves are: 

wave 2 = 0.5 - 0.8 of wave 1  
wave 3 = 1.236 - 1.618 of wave 1  
wave 4 = 0.5 - 0.618 of wave 3  
wave 5 = 0.618 - 1 of wave 1  
wave B = 0.5 - 0.8 of wave A  
wave C = 0.618 - 1.236 of wave A  

Now if you check what happened in subwave a of ((y)) of Y you can see that: 

Wave (i) of a: 985$ 
Wave (ii) of a: 434$  
Wave ( iii -0.46% ) of a: 1207$  
Wave (iv) of a: 691$ [~0.618 of Wave ( iii -0.46% )] 
Wave (v) of a: 950$  








I have seen  BTC -1.55%  impulsive waves fibo ratios almost the same as the previous impulsive wave fibo ratios. 
Now if you apply the same for the last wave C of (E) this is what you get: 

Wave ((i)) of c: 1587$ 
Wave ((ii)) of c  = 793$ 
Wave (( iii -0.46% )) of c  = 1961$ 
Wave ((iv)) of c [~0.618 of Wave (( iii -0.46% ))] = 1212$ 
Wave ((v)) of c  = 1587$ 








Also note that Wave ((iv)) might not retrace upto 0.618 of Wave (( iii -0.46% )) as everyone will be in panic mode by that time so minimum retracement would be around 0.386 of Wave (( iii -0.46% )) which is around 756$ and this is why i can see it goes down to 5k level or little bit more towards 4.7k which is the lowest level of the  support zone  (orange dotted lines) 








So 3 Possible Support lines for reversal would be 

1. Blue: 5800 - 6100 (Only possible if Wave ((v)) is truncated) 
2. Orange: 4700 - 5000 (This is most likely where we heading)  
3. Red: 4100 - 4400 (Only possible if Wave (( iii -0.46% )) is extended)

 Bitcoin -1.55%  has recently developed an interesting pattern of completing a  bullish  and  bearish  cycle on the sixth of every month in an alternating order. As we can see in the chart above, a fall is followed by a rise. This has happened twice before and is expected to happen again now on the  6th 0.00%  of June, 2018. This time  Bitcoin -1.55%  will finish a  bearish  cycle and I expected to begin the next  bullish  cycle at least till the end of  6th 0.00%  of July, 2018. 

This pattern of rise and fall is also supported by other patterns on the chart that signal a  bullish  reversal. The support line has also held firmly and if this pattern of alternating rise and fall ensues,  Bitcoin -1.55%  could very well make new highs by the end of the year. The  RSI  is recovering from oversold levels and has now approached a normal.  Bitcoin -1.55%  is currently at a favorable point for  bullish  entries. The price broke a long term resistance as it break past the downtrend line in April, 2018. This was a big accomplishment for the bulls but the lack of confidence pulled the price back to the support line. Currently, the price is just above the support line and appears to be all set for a  bullish  comeback but the reality is, there are not enough bulls in the market. 

The past few months have been devastating for the price of  Bitcoin -1.55%  ( BTC -1.55% ) and a lot of investors are still running scared. Institutional investors are looking for more clarity regarding regulations concerning cryptocurrencies and also safer ways to invest and store their coins. As for retail investors, most of them comprise of first time investors who have never traded any financial asset before. So, when they saw that  Bitcoin -1.55%  ( BTC -1.55% ) is making 20% gains every day, they thought this could go on forever and jumped with both feet, only to find the carpet pulled under from their feet. Big investors have always played small investors as cannon fodder and have gotten away with their schemes even in regulated markets like forex or the stock market. Cryptocurrencies is a new market with no proper regulations which means it is natural to expect that those who can afford to not play by the rules, most likely won’t.

Hello friends,  

It's been a while since my last post; lack of time and an urge to do more research has mainly driven me to take a break from posting ideas on TradingView. I am still in the process of doing more research and study, but I figure posting once in a while couldn't hurt. 

Since I have become recently very convinced about this, I am outlining a very possible situation with  Bitcoin -1.55%  where the  trend line  we have been on since early October breaks, reaching around a temporary low of $5000. This is examined on the  daily chart , since this is one of the best charts to examine trends of this size. I have to first and foremost say that I am not trying to spread fear, I know many people do not like to hear  bearish  ideas, but  technical analysis  is ultimately a rational exercise, and I feel that possibilities with very strong signs should be explored. 

There are a few things to look at, but I first want to talk about the big picture with, long-term  support and resistance  lines. I think most people can agree that there was a very significant downtrending resistance line that began from the peak of the  ATH 0.63%  in late December, to the low of around $6400 (thick red line). After the break from that line, it seems we moved into a sideways trend, bouncing back and forth between an emerging downtrending resistance line (light red) and a support line that we seem to have been respecting since mid-October (light green); at least this appears to be the case with the lows, where the angle's effectiveness appears very strongly. Finally, based on previous bounces, we can establish a support of around $5000-$5300 (I've thus created a small  support zone  around that range, in dark green), as well as lower supports around $3200 and $2000 (though I do not believe these will be reached, in dark green).   

Now, onto the analysis - it's no secret that  Bitcoin -1.55%  has been squeezing in, ready for a significant move either upwards or downwards. Initially I considered the upwards move to be more likely due to the significant media attention cryptocurrency has been receiving, but after viewing previous market cycles of  Bitcoin -1.55%  (check 2013), it seems clear to me that the  bearish  scenario of closing in on the market cycle is very likely, and should at the very least be prepared for with proper risk management. According to Dow Theory, which is said to have laid the foundations of modern  technical analysis , history repeats itself, and this is a situation where we forced to consider this. 

Should we break from the line, we will likely fall straight down to the $5000-$5000 area, where we will shoot back up and bounce towards around $6700 or so (maybe a little less). From there one, we will likely enter a sideways trend, which we will continue until we see higher highs and higher lows and parabolic movement returns, which could lead to us challenging the all-time high, and hitting $35k-$50k. 

NOTE: I seem to have reached the max character limit for this section of the idea, so I will continue my text below.

Comment:
					Onto the short-term: 


Scenario A: 

The reason why I have drawn this movement into a pennant is this way, is simply because we have been moving through this ascending triangle for quite a while now (May 23rd to today). I don't think that the pattern will be sufficient to directly lead into a strong sell-off, but we should consider that the size of ascending triangle suggests a small movement downwards at the very least, which can create a higher low, and thus move into position into a bearish pennant. Why would a bearish pennant occur here and not have a bounce to $8500-$8700? The reason is in positioning - the huge downtrend (May 5th to May 26th) creates a very nice flagpole in which it hits around the $5000 area very perfectly, and thus I would not be surprised if this happens. 

Second reason: on the Stoch RSI indicator on the daily chart, it appears to be dangerously high, which would suggest it being oversold. For the most part, it seems to have called lows and highs, at least to some extent. This overdrawn movement may very well have increased the likelyhood of Bitcoin being oversold. This could suggest that this is the last step into a sharp downturn, but this does not preclude Situation B. Volume has also been steadily decreasing, but this is the case with any sort of consolidation, I believe. 

Finally, the lines I have drawn below the triangle are simply bounces that I think seem fairly reasonable. The length from to support to the lines correlate with the length of the flagpole, of course, though it may seem chopped off due to the huge line from the long-term support downwards. 


Scenario B: 

This is much simpler, Bitcoin hits the upper resistance line, bounces off, challenges the lower support line, and we potentially see a break, and the rest unfolds from there. 


----------------------------------------------------------------------- 


With all this being said, do not fear if you are hoping for more parabolic movement - this likely will not be the end, and will simply be the set up for a long, drawn out sideways movement until the first signs of bullish activity begin and we start all over again. If you are longing around here, please consider using risk management, prepare for every possibility. If you are shorting, the same applies. 

Please trade with care. I wish the best to all traders!

Comment:
					This really is a very minor note, but I just want to emphasize that the rising wedge (which I erroneously refer to as an ascending triangle, a bad habit I have) entering a bearish pennant is more based on intuition than anything. Also, this pennant is mainly based on the conservative assumption that the break will happen at 7900, if it happens at 7700 where we seem to be general resistance, the pennant would look something like this:

I am Mid term-bullish on  BTC -1.55%  going into the end of this week, but looking to get into the market on a pull back to occur before I get in to the market.  The jury is still out as to whether this weekly bear trend is ready to turn around.  

We can see that both the  RSI  and  MFI  are both  Bullish  on the daily having bottomed when reaching oversold on both at c. $7k support where we found our longer term  trend line . 

We are currently in the process of meeting the Tenkan (blue line) as I write this, so in the very short term, I am looking for a pull back to $7550 range for an entry.  One of the main reasons for this is that on the 4hour timeframes we are close to completing an edge to edge trade so the risk reward doesn’t fit my profile, however a break out from the cloud or above the Tenkan around $7777 will make me enter the market. 

The  RSI  and  MFI  have both been excellent indicators in this bear market.  Whenever  RSI  has gone above the 60 and the  MFI  80; its time to exit the market from a  bullish  trade and consider shorting as it progresses higher.   

Based on the  RSI ,  MFI  trends and the fact that we will run into the Kijun at just around $8-8.2k, I will be scalling out at this  bearish  confluence level to start looking for pull backs and reassessment as i believe it to be a key point as  

Best case scenario this trade would yield a 10% return before leverage. 
This is for illustrative purposes only, please DYOR and goodluck with your trading.

So the pullback trade that we were looking at worked out & has made it's way back to the neckline level of structure. We are now at what i like to call a ""decision point"" Essentially IF price is able to violate this current level od structure THEN we're likely to continue to our next price projection.  

Something that a lot of newer traders don't understand is that when it comes to bigger moves, the market will often provide multiple opportunities to get involved. For those who don't rush and for those who don't get discouraged. If you perform consistent analysis you can often find multiple ways to involve yourself in a trade even if you missed the first strike.

This is the way markets move, If you question my charting check my previous posts. Its as simple as pie. We are going down, How long and how far is too soon to say. Here is a chart that we can understand the future price action and where to buy back. Before you guys start blasting my comment section with the time and how it may not be right thats correct. I am not calculating the time I'm just making a technical drawing of the directions that we will see in the next few months.  

Recent price action has clear signs of wash trading / market manipulation fud and lots of nonsense. Its hard to prove almost impossible so as a trader we just need to deal with it. Ideally the situation you are supposed to trade are critical break up and break down points to enter the trade. Dont enter or exit dumb trades and lose money. As an experienced trader you should be looking for shorts, I would not consider a long unless we are over $10-12k

I am never good with words so instead of writing paragraphs of clarification to justify my call for SHORT since my last posting, I have explained everything on my chart with the least words possible using Fibonacci. It does not matter how popular  Bitcoin -1.55%  has become, or how deep it has disrupted the financial sector, or how many institutional investors have come to invest in it -- the psychology behind a market cycle does not change. 

I don't really encourage anyone to short  Bitcoin -1.55% , but in all honesty, don't expect the bulls to fly anytime soon. Like I said before, this correction that we are having right now is the ""MOTHER OF ALL CORRECTIONS"" after a 4-year-long bull cycle since the 2013 correction... and we are just halfway through.

My best idea ever, taking some time off the last 2 days :) The whales just continue to play their little games by squeezing leveraged short and long positions out of the market. Can't play them, it's just too easy. Maybe it's time we retail traders stand together, combine our  volume  and use their own game against them. Yeah, maybe we could even make a blockbuster movie about this :) I love me some science fiction :) LOL  

My last update of the previous analysis i showed 2 important support levels where the price could bounce up from. The first support around 7350 did the trick and the price got pushed back to 7700. From that point on i told my members that i thought i was seeing distribution, but it was still very confusing to figure out what was going on. TA was showing  bullish  signs, that  bull flag  was very strong and was even turning slowly up and was about to squeeze upwards. But of course out of no where the price got dumped, the move we saw a few hours ago. After that 200 point drop the price got pushed up again to 7700 like that dump was a glitch. If your a whale, why not push out leveraged traders and take your money while your accumulating or distributing. It's like a bonus, like the cherry on top :)  

Anyway, in this chart we can see allot of similarities of what is going on. As you know i have been saying i am still  bearish  for the medium term, but i just could not say what was going to happen on the short term. 2 days ago after we finally dropped out of that  wedge , i said we would have 2 options.  
- Break those 2 support levels from the last update of my previous chart (73xx and 71xx) 
- Make a higher low at those same support levels and make another move up above the high.  
 
As we can see in the chart, the  fractal  is not 100% identical so it's no guarantee that the 7700 high we just saw is the high already and that we start to move down. But based on this  fractal , i don't want to see the price get above the 7800/7900. This  fractal  confirms my  bearish  view as well. That's why TA is so great, you can turn any chart to fit your view :). 

Even without this  fractal , i just give it a very small chance that 7K price action is the fundament of a low to start another bull rally, i just highly doubt that. I want to see more  volume  to begin with and at least  double bottom  kind of formation. So the minimum i expect is a test of the 7100/6900in the coming week or 2. But the movement i have in mind for the med term is a drop below the 7K to form a big V shape low. If we get to see that, than i might even become  bullish  for the rest of the year :).  

As long as the price stays above the 73xx, we have to assume the bulls are still in control and we should see another wave up. So for me the 73xx is an important turning point.

					At the moment it looks like bulls are trying to push higher, this bull flag/triangle is still very strong. So no sign of weakness yet! First small sign would be a drop below 7620/7600. Bulls need to break 7700

Comment:
					This is my bigger picture, think this bearish triangle is still 100% in play. I think if bulls can't break the 7800/7900 the bearish version is probably going to happen. Can't say HOW it will go, this blue line is just a guess. But a big V shape low would be the most bullish for the long term. I still think we are seeing distribution here. The only way this idea can be countered, is through a big increase of buying volume, if that doesn't happen, i think it's only a matter of time.

The price took a small dump but the volume was low so no real read on what the intent was. So we might see another move up, if we start to see a small pump that takes out the 7800, be aware of a fake breakout. The blue line is a possibility of what the move could look like IF we move up and if the breakout fails. If that happens than we will probably get confirmation if the price breaks the 7600ish. If we break the 7800 it should stay above the 7700 to confirm another move up. Not much more to say about what's going on.

541,1528359434.0,Taiwan_Bear,2618 (Double top & 0.618 pull-back) - do not miss it!!,"
In the last couple of TAs I have mentioned the “2618 pattern” and have been asked what 2618 means. Sorry for taking it so long as it took me quite a while to put everything altogether. But, as promised, I have explained below the rules and trade setups for the 2618 pattern.  

What are the rules/setups/steps for 2618?  
1.	Form a  double top  (Note #1)  
2.	Neckline has to be broken  
3.	After price found support at point (b), wait for pull back to 0.618 fib retracement of (a)(b)  
4.	After price retraced to 0.618, look for confluence and sell (eg. Structures,  trendlines  ,  double top  on a lower time frame,  rsi  divergence,  bearish pin bar  ,  inside bar  break down etc.) (Note #2)  
5.	Stop loss to be set above  double top 
6.	Set Take Profit levels (Note #3)  

Note #1 ( Double top ):  
The first step for the formation of 2618 is to form a  double top  at key resistance levels. Why at key resistance levels? Because we want to avoid fake double tops which can occur occasionally.  

There are some variations between various resources (books, websites) regarding the definitions of “double top”. The main differences occur where:  
a)	Some said for a  double top  to be valid, the wick of the 2nd top cannot exceed the wick of the 1st top; whereas, others said:  
b)	The wick of the 2nd top can exceed the wick of the 1st top but the candle close of the 2nd top CANNOT exceed the wick of the 1st top; or  
c)	The wick of the 2nd top can exceed the wick of the 1st top and the candle close of the 2nd top CAN exceed the wick of the 1st top; or  
d)	The wick of the 2nd top meets at least the candle close of the 1st top; or  
e)	The body of the 2nd top cannot exceed the body of the 1st top  

Personally, I would say all the above definitions work just fine although I do prefer definition a) because it means that the selling pressure is strong and the bulls fail to make a higher high. When there is a higher high formed in a downtrend, it can mean the downtrend has reversed and therefore you might not want to sell when the price pulls back to the 0.618 fib retracement.  

Note #2 ( 0.618 retracement ):  
When the price pulls back to 0.618, it does not mean to sell straight away. There must be more than one reason to sell other than the 0.618 retrace. The more reasons the better. In this example, you can see there are certainly structures (key resistance levels) at the 0.618 retrace. As well, there was a  double top  formed on the lower time frame. Consequently, you can sell.  

After  BTC -1.52%  hit the 0.618 retrace the first time, the price dropped from $9735 to $8650. but quickly bounced back to the 0.618 retrace level. That was a second & better opportunity to sell. Not only did  BTC -1.52%  form a  double top  on the larger time frame, but also with a  bearish  divergence on the 4hr time frame. Accordingly, you have more reasons to sell.  

Note #3 (Set take profit)  
Same as the rules of “Double top”, there are some variations as to which price level should you take profits. Personally, I would stick to the below:  
1)	First, take profit when risk/reward ratio hits 1:1 (recommend to take 30% - 50% profits and adjust the SL of the remaining positions to break-even)  
2)	When price hits the same price level as the low after the neckline is broken ((b) point in this example)  
3)	When price hits 1.272 fib extension of (a)(b)  
4)	When price hits point (d) (using  AB=CD  pattern. If you are not sure what the rules of  AB=CD  are, you can refer to my previous TA in which I have attached the link below)  
5)	If in a one-way market (heavily bearish/bullish), you can always keep 10% to 20% of your positions and take profits when risk/reward ratio hits 1:5 or even 1:10

 BTC -1.52%  is on the verge of breaking to a daily higher high on the bounce if the bulls can see a push this morning. 
If we reject from here the daily will form a lower high and we will see a tightening pattern within the highlighted  support and resistance  lines.  
Important for the bulls to show up or we could stay in this range into tomorrow.  
Healthy consolidation after the most recent bull move and the 15 min chart needs to change the trend.  
Also look to  EMA  12 support on the 4 hour and hourly.  
Another morning like yesterday with the bulls comfortable as worst case, we likely stay in the tightening pattern if bulls cannot prove themselves.

The current situation of  Bitcoin -1.51%  is quite difficult. We are on a clear treshold. A lot of traders are saying that we are on a clear downtrend, but the same amount of people are claiming that we will have our reversal soon. 

This article tries to sum up all important information you have to need! 

1: Retracement of a parabolic uptrend: 
There is a rule of thumb for the retracement of a parabolic uptrend. We should retrace to approx. the 0.786  Fibonacci Retracement  +/- 10%! 
Depending where we start the count, we are already in that target. Although both ways (blue and red) have still some space for a further downwave! 







2: The bloody support of Bitcoin: 
The average cost of mining one  bitcoin -1.51%  are at USA/Russia approx. 4700$ and at 3100$ for china! 
A drop below a target of 4700$ would be savage. Nevertheless, i can't image that we will hit that target. 







3: Manipulation of  Bitcoin -1.51%  and the Bart Simpson Pattern: 
A friend of mine found some unusual patterns in the orderbooks of several exchanges: 
https://twitter.com/CryptoSyndrome 
Altcoins are manipulated on a daily basis. It seems that  bitcoin -1.51%  is now affected to this too, which causes all these 3-5% pump and dumps. 
Thus, we are forming all the time the Bartin Simpsons Patterns. 

4: Similarity to 2014: 
Bitcoin -1.51%  now: 






Bitcoin -1.51%  2014: 







5: Deminishing downtrend and a strong support 
If we see the falling  wedges  as the force of the downtrend, then the force is diminishing! 
Furthermore we have strong support which is holding now for the 4th time! 







6: The Indicators 
Having a look at the indicators at 2D, we have a good potential for an upwave now. 
The  volume  is deminishing which should indicate a breakout soon. 
The  MACD  is about to cross, the  RSI  was slightly overbought and is heading up like the  Stoch .  RSI . 
The 200  EMA  is slighty under the current price and act as a support. 

7: The symetrical Triangle 
The theory says, that we should have in a  sym -0.80% . triangle 5 times an  ABC  wave. The waves are not perfect, but we can construct them. 






As you can see, the last four ABC-Waves formed always a 1:1 extention, which indicates that we have finished wave 5. 

8: A possible Head and Shoulders 
Even if this is not the most perfect  Head and Shoulders  Pattern, it's still valid! 
We are currently at the neckline, which is a strong and important resistance. Breaking upwards should indicate a good uptrend. 







9: The magic  6th 0.00%  of the month 






Suprisingly we have on every  6th 0.00%  of the month a reversal. Why is that??? 
One reason could be the  CME Group Futures  with dates for the settlements always nearby the  6th 0.00%  of the month! 
http://www.cmegroup.com 

10: Longterm  Bullish  TA 
The whole pattern could be seen as a big  bullish pennant . 







11: Shortterm  Bullish  TA 
Leading diagonal  starting wave1 of an  Elliott Wave , since we have now an impulse wave, after the 5x  ABC  pattern inside the triangle is finished. 
Our target should be at the top of the triangle nearby 8600-8800$. 







12: Longterm  Bearish  TA 
We also can argue, that we are currenty in an downtrend and the  sym -0.80% . triangle just continuing the trend. 
Our target should be nearby 6000$ which is also a finished downwards  Elliott Wave .

Nothing is happening in the market:  volatility  has become extinct and coins' trading fallen out of fashion. Range-bound bots and robotic humans absolutely prosper in this environment. The price was unable to break the 7700 threshold. For me this is a  bearish  signal. Indicators provide mixed signals, so let's examine wave structure. The move from May 29 is a  3-wave -0.12%  correction within a larger downtrend. A price drop below 7500 would confirm this scenario.

					Impulse Wave Truncation (Truncated Fifth) - 
Truncated 5th wave is when the market has become so over-extended in Wave 3 that there is not much force left for the impulse wave to come to a proper completion. So when this happens, there is a chance that the last wave of the impulse, Wave 5, will not reach the end of Wave 3 before the market starts correcting in the opposite direction. At this point, the market is just too exhausted. This condition is often called a “failure” or a “Truncation.”

I can see many people still believe that we are going inside a  descending triangle . I also believed this in my idea that i shard on may 1st: 



 

Things can change so quickly and if we didn't adapt to the changes then someone will. That's why i believe that we have to be in fast adapt mode in this market. Doesn't mean that you need to change without checking yourself. I try to find 2-3 confirmations before i change my idea on something. This includes pattern changes, trend changes etc 

There are 21 corrective wave patterns in EW which is categorized into major 3 corrective wave patterns: 

Zigzag  (5-3-5) 
Flat (3-3-5) 
Triangle (3-3-3-3-3) 

And other patterns are combinations of the above which is:  

Double three (A combination of two corrective patterns above) 
Triple three (A combination of three corrective patterns above) 

So what i can see now is that we are in two double three combination corrective wave pattern: 








More info here:  

https://elliottwave-forecast.com/elliott-wave-theory/#corrective-waves 

Confirmations: 

1. Wave ((i)) of C is 1.6k and ((v)) is going to be completed below the triangle 
2. Wave (E) of the triangle can't go beyond the triangle.  
3. This has happened twice before in 2013 & 2015 

Each wave  got 3 subwaves (a,b &c) inside and we are in the subwave c of ((y)) of Y which is an impulsive wave. 

Impulsive waves: 1,3,5,a,c 
Corrective waves: 2,4,b 

Normal Fibo Ratios for these waves are: 

wave 2 = 0.5 - 0.8 of wave 1  
wave 3 = 1.236 - 1.618 of wave 1  
wave 4 = 0.5 - 0.618 of wave 3  
wave 5 = 0.618 - 1 of wave 1  
wave B = 0.5 - 0.8 of wave A  
wave C = 0.618 - 1.236 of wave A  

Now if you check what happened in subwave a of ((y)) of Y you can see that: 

Wave (i) of a: 985$ 
Wave (ii) of a: 434$  
Wave ( iii -0.46% ) of a: 1207$  
Wave (iv) of a: 691$ [~0.618 of Wave ( iii -0.46% )] 
Wave (v) of a: 950$  








I have seen  BTC -1.43%  impulsive waves fibo ratios almost the same as the previous impulsive wave fibo ratios. 
Now if you apply the same for the last wave C of (E) this is what you get: 

Wave ((i)) of c: 1587$ 
Wave ((ii)) of c  = 793$ 
Wave (( iii -0.46% )) of c  = 1961$ 
Wave ((iv)) of c [~0.618 of Wave (( iii -0.46% ))] = 1212$ 
Wave ((v)) of c  = 1587$ 








Also note that Wave ((iv)) might not retrace upto 0.618 of Wave (( iii -0.46% )) as everyone will be in panic mode by that time so minimum retracement would be around 0.386 of Wave (( iii -0.46% )) which is around 756$ and this is why i can see it goes down to 5k level or little bit more towards 4.7k which is the lowest level of the  support zone  (orange dotted lines) 








So 3 Possible Support lines for reversal would be

 Bitcoin -1.46%  has recently developed an interesting pattern of completing a  bullish  and  bearish  cycle on the sixth of every month in an alternating order. As we can see in the chart above, a fall is followed by a rise. This has happened twice before and is expected to happen again now on the  6th 0.00%  of June, 2018. This time  Bitcoin -1.46%  will finish a  bearish  cycle and I expected to begin the next  bullish  cycle at least till the end of  6th 0.00%  of July, 2018. 

This pattern of rise and fall is also supported by other patterns on the chart that signal a  bullish  reversal. The support line has also held firmly and if this pattern of alternating rise and fall ensues,  Bitcoin -1.46%  could very well make new highs by the end of the year. The  RSI  is recovering from oversold levels and has now approached a normal.  Bitcoin -1.46%  is currently at a favorable point for  bullish  entries. The price broke a long term resistance as it break past the downtrend line in April, 2018. This was a big accomplishment for the bulls but the lack of confidence pulled the price back to the support line. Currently, the price is just above the support line and appears to be all set for a  bullish  comeback but the reality is, there are not enough bulls in the market. 

The past few months have been devastating for the price of  Bitcoin -1.46%  ( BTC -1.46% ) and a lot of investors are still running scared. Institutional investors are looking for more clarity regarding regulations concerning cryptocurrencies and also safer ways to invest and store their coins. As for retail investors, most of them comprise of first time investors who have never traded any financial asset before. So, when they saw that  Bitcoin -1.46%  ( BTC -1.46% ) is making 20% gains every day, they thought this could go on forever and jumped with both feet, only to find the carpet pulled under from their feet. Big investors have always played small investors as cannon fodder and have gotten away with their schemes even in regulated markets like forex or the stock market. Cryptocurrencies is a new market with no proper regulations which means it is natural to expect that those who can afford to not play by the rules, most likely won’t.

Hello friends,  

It's been a while since my last post; lack of time and an urge to do more research has mainly driven me to take a break from posting ideas on TradingView. I am still in the process of doing more research and study, but I figure posting once in a while couldn't hurt. 

Since I have become recently very convinced about this, I am outlining a very possible situation with  Bitcoin -1.48%  where the  trend line  we have been on since early October breaks, reaching around a temporary low of $5000. This is examined on the  daily chart , since this is one of the best charts to examine trends of this size. I have to first and foremost say that I am not trying to spread fear, I know many people do not like to hear  bearish  ideas, but  technical analysis  is ultimately a rational exercise, and I feel that possibilities with very strong signs should be explored. 

There are a few things to look at, but I first want to talk about the big picture with, long-term  support and resistance  lines. I think most people can agree that there was a very significant downtrending resistance line that began from the peak of the  ATH 0.63%  in late December, to the low of around $6400 (thick red line). After the break from that line, it seems we moved into a sideways trend, bouncing back and forth between an emerging downtrending resistance line (light red) and a support line that we seem to have been respecting since mid-October (light green); at least this appears to be the case with the lows, where the angle's effectiveness appears very strongly. Finally, based on previous bounces, we can establish a support of around $5000-$5300 (I've thus created a small  support zone  around that range, in dark green), as well as lower supports around $3200 and $2000 (though I do not believe these will be reached, in dark green).   

Now, onto the analysis - it's no secret that  Bitcoin -1.48%  has been squeezing in, ready for a significant move either upwards or downwards. Initially I considered the upwards move to be more likely due to the significant media attention cryptocurrency has been receiving, but after viewing previous market cycles of  Bitcoin -1.48%  (check 2013), it seems clear to me that the  bearish  scenario of closing in on the market cycle is very likely, and should at the very least be prepared for with proper risk management. According to Dow Theory, which is said to have laid the foundations of modern  technical analysis , history repeats itself, and this is a situation where we forced to consider this. 

Should we break from the line, we will likely fall straight down to the $5000-$5000 area, where we will shoot back up and bounce towards around $6700 or so (maybe a little less). From there one, we will likely enter a sideways trend, which we will continue until we see higher highs and higher lows and parabolic movement returns, which could lead to us challenging the all-time high, and hitting $35k-$50k. 

NOTE: I seem to have reached the max character limit for this section of the idea, so I will continue my text below.

Comment:
					Onto the short-term: 


Scenario A: 

The reason why I have drawn this movement into a pennant is this way, is simply because we have been moving through this ascending triangle for quite a while now (May 23rd to today). I don't think that the pattern will be sufficient to directly lead into a strong sell-off, but we should consider that the size of ascending triangle suggests a small movement downwards at the very least, which can create a higher low, and thus move into position into a bearish pennant. Why would a bearish pennant occur here and not have a bounce to $8500-$8700? The reason is in positioning - the huge downtrend (May 5th to May 26th) creates a very nice flagpole in which it hits around the $5000 area very perfectly, and thus I would not be surprised if this happens. 

Second reason: on the Stoch RSI indicator on the daily chart, it appears to be dangerously high, which would suggest it being oversold. For the most part, it seems to have called lows and highs, at least to some extent. This overdrawn movement may very well have increased the likelyhood of Bitcoin being oversold. This could suggest that this is the last step into a sharp downturn, but this does not preclude Situation B. Volume has also been steadily decreasing, but this is the case with any sort of consolidation, I believe. 

Finally, the lines I have drawn below the triangle are simply bounces that I think seem fairly reasonable. The length from to support to the lines correlate with the length of the flagpole, of course, though it may seem chopped off due to the huge line from the long-term support downwards. 


Scenario B: 

This is much simpler, Bitcoin hits the upper resistance line, bounces off, challenges the lower support line, and we potentially see a break, and the rest unfolds from there. 


----------------------------------------------------------------------- 


With all this being said, do not fear if you are hoping for more parabolic movement - this likely will not be the end, and will simply be the set up for a long, drawn out sideways movement until the first signs of bullish activity begin and we start all over again. If you are longing around here, please consider using risk management, prepare for every possibility. If you are shorting, the same applies. 

Please trade with care. I wish the best to all traders!

Comment:
					This really is a very minor note, but I just want to emphasize that the rising wedge (which I erroneously refer to as an ascending triangle, a bad habit I have) entering a bearish pennant is more based on intuition than anything. Also, this pennant is mainly based on the conservative assumption that the break will happen at 7900, if it happens at 7700 where we seem to be general resistance, the pennant would look something like this:

Jun 7




I am Mid term-bullish on  BTC -1.48%  going into the end of this week, but looking to get into the market on a pull back to occur before I get in to the market.  The jury is still out as to whether this weekly bear trend is ready to turn around.  

We can see that both the  RSI  and  MFI  are both  Bullish  on the daily having bottomed when reaching oversold on both at c. $7k support where we found our longer term  trend line . 

We are currently in the process of meeting the Tenkan (blue line) as I write this, so in the very short term, I am looking for a pull back to $7550 range for an entry.  One of the main reasons for this is that on the 4hour timeframes we are close to completing an edge to edge trade so the risk reward doesn’t fit my profile, however a break out from the cloud or above the Tenkan around $7777 will make me enter the market. 

The  RSI  and  MFI  have both been excellent indicators in this bear market.  Whenever  RSI  has gone above the 60 and the  MFI  80; its time to exit the market from a  bullish  trade and consider shorting as it progresses higher.   

Based on the  RSI ,  MFI  trends and the fact that we will run into the Kijun at just around $8-8.2k, I will be scalling out at this  bearish  confluence level to start looking for pull backs and reassessment as i believe it to be a key point as  

Best case scenario this trade would yield a 10% return before leverage. 
This is for illustrative purposes only, please DYOR and goodluck with your trading.

So the pullback trade that we were looking at worked out & has made it's way back to the neckline level of structure. We are now at what i like to call a ""decision point"" Essentially IF price is able to violate this current level od structure THEN we're likely to continue to our next price projection.  

Something that a lot of newer traders don't understand is that when it comes to bigger moves, the market will often provide multiple opportunities to get involved. For those who don't rush and for those who don't get discouraged. If you perform consistent analysis you can often find multiple ways to involve yourself in a trade even if you missed the first strike.

I am not calculating the time I'm just making a technical drawing of the directions that we will see in the next few months.  

Recent price action has clear signs of wash trading / market manipulation fud and lots of nonsense. Its hard to prove almost impossible so as a trader we just need to deal with it. Ideally the situation you are supposed to trade are critical break up and break down points to enter the trade. Dont enter or exit dumb trades and lose money.

I am never good with words so instead of writing paragraphs of clarification to justify my call for SHORT since my last posting, I have explained everything on my chart with the least words possible using Fibonacci. It does not matter how popular  Bitcoin -1.46%  has become, or how deep it has disrupted the financial sector, or how many institutional investors have come to invest in it -- the psychology behind a market cycle does not change. 

I don't really encourage anyone to short  Bitcoin -1.46% , but in all honesty, don't expect the bulls to fly anytime soon. Like I said before, this correction that we are having right now is the ""MOTHER OF ALL CORRECTIONS"" after a 4-year-long bull cycle since the 2013 correction... and we are just halfway through.

My best idea ever, taking some time off the last 2 days :) The whales just continue to play their little games by squeezing leveraged short and long positions out of the market. Can't play them, it's just too easy. Maybe it's time we retail traders stand together, combine our  volume  and use their own game against them. Yeah, maybe we could even make a blockbuster movie about this :) I love me some science fiction :) LOL  

My last update of the previous analysis i showed 2 important support levels where the price could bounce up from. The first support around 7350 did the trick and the price got pushed back to 7700. From that point on i told my members that i thought i was seeing distribution, but it was still very confusing to figure out what was going on. TA was showing  bullish  signs, that  bull flag  was very strong and was even turning slowly up and was about to squeeze upwards. But of course out of no where the price got dumped, the move we saw a few hours ago. After that 200 point drop the price got pushed up again to 7700 like that dump was a glitch. If your a whale, why not push out leveraged traders and take your money while your accumulating or distributing. It's like a bonus, like the cherry on top :)  

Anyway, in this chart we can see allot of similarities of what is going on. As you know i have been saying i am still  bearish  for the medium term, but i just could not say what was going to happen on the short term. 2 days ago after we finally dropped out of that  wedge , i said we would have 2 options.  
- Break those 2 support levels from the last update of my previous chart (73xx and 71xx) 
- Make a higher low at those same support levels and make another move up above the high.  
 
As we can see in the chart, the  fractal  is not 100% identical so it's no guarantee that the 7700 high we just saw is the high already and that we start to move down. But based on this  fractal , i don't want to see the price get above the 7800/7900. This  fractal  confirms my  bearish  view as well. That's why TA is so great, you can turn any chart to fit your view :). 

Even without this  fractal , i just give it a very small chance that 7K price action is the fundament of a low to start another bull rally, i just highly doubt that. I want to see more  volume  to begin with and at least  double bottom  kind of formation. So the minimum i expect is a test of the 7100/6900in the coming week or 2. But the movement i have in mind for the med term is a drop below the 7K to form a big V shape low. If we get to see that, than i might even become  bullish  for the rest of the year :).  

As long as the price stays above the 73xx, we have to assume the bulls are still in control and we should see another wave up. So for me the 73xx is an important turning point.

					This is my bigger picture, think this bearish triangle is still 100% in play. I think if bulls can't break the 7800/7900 the bearish version is probably going to happen. Can't say HOW it will go, this blue line is just a guess. But a big V shape low would be the most bullish for the long term. I still think we are seeing distribution here. The only way this idea can be countered, is through a big increase of buying volume, if that doesn't happen, i think it's only a matter of time.

					What a surprise, nothing has changed :) 

The price took a small dump but the volume was low so no real read on what the intent was. So we might see another move up, if we start to see a small pump that takes out the 7800, be aware of a fake breakout. The blue line is a possibility of what the move could look like IF we move up and if the breakout fails. If that happens than we will probably get confirmation if the price breaks the 7600ish. If we break the 7800 it should stay above the 7700 to confirm another move up. Not much more to say about what's going on.

					So we have made a small drop, but there is no volume confirming it, not yet at least. First small support has been broken, but not yet very meaningful because of the low volume. For the ones who shorted it, just be aware of another squeeze up, since this small move downwards looks a bit to controlled.  

Pure TA, it broke the channel and retested the former support as resistance now.

559,1528359434.0,Taiwan_Bear,2618 (Double top & 0.618 pull-back) - do not miss it!!,"
In the last couple of TAs I have mentioned the “2618 pattern” and have been asked what 2618 means. Sorry for taking it so long as it took me quite a while to put everything altogether. But, as promised, I have explained below the rules and trade setups for the 2618 pattern.  

What are the rules/setups/steps for 2618?  
1.	Form a  double top  (Note #1)  
2.	Neckline has to be broken  
3.	After price found support at point (b), wait for pull back to 0.618 fib retracement of (a)(b)  
4.	After price retraced to 0.618, look for confluence and sell (eg. Structures,  trendlines  ,  double top  on a lower time frame,  rsi  divergence,  bearish pin bar  ,  inside bar  break down etc.) (Note #2)  
5.	Stop loss to be set above  double top 
6.	Set Take Profit levels (Note #3)  

Note #1 ( Double top ):  
The first step for the formation of 2618 is to form a  double top  at key resistance levels. Why at key resistance levels? Because we want to avoid fake double tops which can occur occasionally.  

There are some variations between various resources (books, websites) regarding the definitions of “double top”. The main differences occur where:  
a)	Some said for a  double top  to be valid, the wick of the 2nd top cannot exceed the wick of the 1st top; whereas, others said:  
b)	The wick of the 2nd top can exceed the wick of the 1st top but the candle close of the 2nd top CANNOT exceed the wick of the 1st top; or  
c)	The wick of the 2nd top can exceed the wick of the 1st top and the candle close of the 2nd top CAN exceed the wick of the 1st top; or  
d)	The wick of the 2nd top meets at least the candle close of the 1st top; or  
e)	The body of the 2nd top cannot exceed the body of the 1st top  

Personally, I would say all the above definitions work just fine although I do prefer definition a) because it means that the selling pressure is strong and the bulls fail to make a higher high. When there is a higher high formed in a downtrend, it can mean the downtrend has reversed and therefore you might not want to sell when the price pulls back to the 0.618 fib retracement.  

Note #2 ( 0.618 retracement ):  
When the price pulls back to 0.618, it does not mean to sell straight away. There must be more than one reason to sell other than the 0.618 retrace. The more reasons the better. In this example, you can see there are certainly structures (key resistance levels) at the 0.618 retrace. As well, there was a  double top  formed on the lower time frame. Consequently, you can sell.  

After  BTC -1.48%  hit the 0.618 retrace the first time, the price dropped from $9735 to $8650. but quickly bounced back to the 0.618 retrace level. That was a second & better opportunity to sell. Not only did  BTC -1.48%  form a  double top  on the larger time frame, but also with a  bearish  divergence on the 4hr time frame. Accordingly, you have more reasons to sell.  

Note #3 (Set take profit)  
Same as the rules of “Double top”, there are some variations as to which price level should you take profits. Personally, I would stick to the below:  
1)	First, take profit when risk/reward ratio hits 1:1 (recommend to take 30% - 50% profits and adjust the SL of the remaining positions to break-even)  
2)	When price hits the same price level as the low after the neckline is broken ((b) point in this example)  
3)	When price hits 1.272 fib extension of (a)(b)  
4)	When price hits point (d) (using  AB=CD  pattern. If you are not sure what the rules of  AB=CD  are, you can refer to my previous TA in which I have attached the link below)  
5)	If in a one-way market (heavily bearish/bullish), you can always keep 10% to 20% of your positions and take profits when risk/reward ratio hits 1:5 or even 1:10

 BTC -1.48%  is on the verge of breaking to a daily higher high on the bounce if the bulls can see a push this morning. 
If we reject from here the daily will form a lower high and we will see a tightening pattern within the highlighted  support and resistance  lines.  
Important for the bulls to show up or we could stay in this range into tomorrow.  
Healthy consolidation after the most recent bull move and the 15 min chart needs to change the trend.  
Also look to  EMA  12 support on the 4 hour and hourly.  
Another morning like yesterday with the bulls comfortable as worst case, we likely stay in the tightening pattern if bulls cannot prove themselves.

Depending where we start the count, we are already in that target. Although both ways (blue and red) have still some space for a further downwave! 







2: The bloody support of Bitcoin: 
The average cost of mining one  bitcoin -1.48%  are at USA/Russia approx. 4700$ and at 3100$ for china! 
A drop below a target of 4700$ would be savage. Nevertheless, i can't image that we will hit that target. 







3: Manipulation of  Bitcoin -1.48%  and the Bart Simpson Pattern: 
A friend of mine found some unusual patterns in the orderbooks of several exchanges: 
https://twitter.com/CryptoSyndrome 
Altcoins are manipulated on a daily basis. It seems that  bitcoin -1.48%  is now affected to this too, which causes all these 3-5% pump and dumps. 
Thus, we are forming all the time the Bartin Simpsons Patterns.

Bitcoin -1.48%  now:

5: Deminishing downtrend and a strong support 
If we see the falling  wedges  as the force of the downtrend, then the force is diminishing! 
Furthermore we have strong support which is holding now for the 4th time! 







6: The Indicators 
Having a look at the indicators at 2D, we have a good potential for an upwave now. 
The  volume  is deminishing which should indicate a breakout soon. 
The  MACD  is about to cross, the  RSI  was slightly overbought and is heading up like the  Stoch .  RSI . 
The 200  EMA  is slighty under the current price and act as a support. 

7: The symetrical Triangle 
The theory says, that we should have in a  sym -0.80% . triangle 5 times an  ABC  wave. The waves are not perfect, but we can construct them. 






As you can see, the last four ABC-Waves formed always a 1:1 extention, which indicates that we have finished wave 5. 

8: A possible Head and Shoulders 
Even if this is not the most perfect  Head and Shoulders  Pattern, it's still valid! 
We are currently at the neckline, which is a strong and important resistance. Breaking upwards should indicate a good uptrend. 







9: The magic  6th 0.00%  of the month 






Suprisingly we have on every  6th 0.00%  of the month a reversal. Why is that??? 
One reason could be the  CME Group Futures  with dates for the settlements always nearby the  6th 0.00%  of the month! 
http://www.cmegroup.com 

10: Longterm  Bullish  TA 
The whole pattern could be seen as a big  bullish pennant . 







11: Shortterm  Bullish  TA 
Leading diagonal  starting wave1 of an  Elliott Wave , since we have now an impulse wave, after the 5x  ABC  pattern inside the triangle is finished. 
Our target should be at the top of the triangle nearby 8600-8800$. 







12: Longterm  Bearish  TA 
We also can argue, that we are currenty in an downtrend and the  sym -0.80% . triangle just continuing the trend. 
Our target should be nearby 6000$ which is also a finished downwards  Elliott Wave .

Nothing is happening in the market:  volatility  has become extinct and coins' trading fallen out of fashion. Range-bound bots and robotic humans absolutely prosper in this environment. The price was unable to break the 7700 threshold. For me this is a  bearish  signal. Indicators provide mixed signals, so let's examine wave structure. The move from May 29 is a  3-wave -0.12%  correction within a larger downtrend. A price drop below 7500 would confirm this scenario.

					Impulse Wave Truncation (Truncated Fifth) - 
Truncated 5th wave is when the market has become so over-extended in Wave 3 that there is not much force left for the impulse wave to come to a proper completion. So when this happens, there is a chance that the last wave of the impulse, Wave 5, will not reach the end of Wave 3 before the market starts correcting in the opposite direction. At this point, the market is just too exhausted. This condition is often called a “failure” or a “Truncation.”

I can see many people still believe that we are going inside a  descending triangle . I also believed this in my idea that i shard on may 1st: 



 

Things can change so quickly and if we didn't adapt to the changes then someone will. That's why i believe that we have to be in fast adapt mode in this market. Doesn't mean that you need to change without checking yourself. I try to find 2-3 confirmations before i change my idea on something. This includes pattern changes, trend changes etc 

There are 21 corrective wave patterns in EW which is categorized into major 3 corrective wave patterns: 

Zigzag  (5-3-5) 
Flat (3-3-5) 
Triangle (3-3-3-3-3) 

And other patterns are combinations of the above which is:  

Double three (A combination of two corrective patterns above) 
Triple three (A combination of three corrective patterns above) 

So what i can see now is that we are in two double three combination corrective wave pattern: 








More info here:  

https://elliottwave-forecast.com/elliott-wave-theory/#corrective-waves 

Confirmations: 

1. Wave ((i)) of C is 1.6k and ((v)) is going to be completed below the triangle 
2. Wave (E) of the triangle can't go beyond the triangle.  
3. This has happened twice before in 2013 & 2015 

Each wave  got 3 subwaves (a,b &c) inside and we are in the subwave c of ((y)) of Y which is an impulsive wave. 

Impulsive waves: 1,3,5,a,c 
Corrective waves: 2,4,b 

Normal Fibo Ratios for these waves are: 

wave 2 = 0.5 - 0.8 of wave 1  
wave 3 = 1.236 - 1.618 of wave 1  
wave 4 = 0.5 - 0.618 of wave 3  
wave 5 = 0.618 - 1 of wave 1  
wave B = 0.5 - 0.8 of wave A  
wave C = 0.618 - 1.236 of wave A  

Now if you check what happened in subwave a of ((y)) of Y you can see that: 

Wave (i) of a: 985$ 
Wave (ii) of a: 434$  
Wave ( iii -0.46% ) of a: 1207$  
Wave (iv) of a: 691$ [~0.618 of Wave ( iii -0.46% )] 
Wave (v) of a: 950$  








I have seen  BTC -1.48%  impulsive waves fibo ratios almost the same as the previous impulsive wave fibo ratios. 
Now if you apply the same for the last wave C of (E) this is what you get: 

Wave ((i)) of c: 1587$ 
Wave ((ii)) of c  = 793$ 
Wave (( iii -0.46% )) of c  = 1961$ 
Wave ((iv)) of c [~0.618 of Wave (( iii -0.46% ))] = 1212$ 
Wave ((v)) of c  = 1587$ 








Also note that Wave ((iv)) might not retrace upto 0.618 of Wave (( iii -0.46% )) as everyone will be in panic mode by that time so minimum retracement would be around 0.386 of Wave (( iii -0.46% )) which is around 756$ and this is why i can see it goes down to 5k level or little bit more towards 4.7k which is the lowest level of the  support zone  (orange dotted lines) 








So 3 Possible Support lines for reversal would be 

1. Blue: 5800 - 6100 (Only possible if Wave ((v)) is truncated) 
2. Orange: 4700 - 5000 (This is most likely where we heading)  
3. Red: 4100 - 4400 (Only possible if Wave (( iii -0.46% )) is extended)

 Bitcoin -1.50%  has recently developed an interesting pattern of completing a  bullish  and  bearish  cycle on the sixth of every month in an alternating order. As we can see in the chart above, a fall is followed by a rise. This has happened twice before and is expected to happen again now on the  6th 0.00%  of June, 2018. This time  Bitcoin -1.50%  will finish a  bearish  cycle and I expected to begin the next  bullish  cycle at least till the end of  6th 0.00%  of July, 2018. 

This pattern of rise and fall is also supported by other patterns on the chart that signal a  bullish  reversal. The support line has also held firmly and if this pattern of alternating rise and fall ensues,  Bitcoin -1.50%  could very well make new highs by the end of the year. The  RSI  is recovering from oversold levels and has now approached a normal.  Bitcoin -1.50%  is currently at a favorable point for  bullish  entries. The price broke a long term resistance as it break past the downtrend line in April, 2018. This was a big accomplishment for the bulls but the lack of confidence pulled the price back to the support line. Currently, the price is just above the support line and appears to be all set for a  bullish  comeback but the reality is, there are not enough bulls in the market. 

The past few months have been devastating for the price of  Bitcoin -1.50%  ( BTC -1.50% ) and a lot of investors are still running scared. Institutional investors are looking for more clarity regarding regulations concerning cryptocurrencies and also safer ways to invest and store their coins. As for retail investors, most of them comprise of first time investors who have never traded any financial asset before. So, when they saw that  Bitcoin -1.50%  ( BTC -1.50% ) is making 20% gains every day, they thought this could go on forever and jumped with both feet, only to find the carpet pulled under from their feet. Big investors have always played small investors as cannon fodder and have gotten away with their schemes even in regulated markets like forex or the stock market. Cryptocurrencies is a new market with no proper regulations which means it is natural to expect that those who can afford to not play by the rules, most likely won’t.

Hello friends,  

It's been a while since my last post; lack of time and an urge to do more research has mainly driven me to take a break from posting ideas on TradingView. I am still in the process of doing more research and study, but I figure posting once in a while couldn't hurt. 

Since I have become recently very convinced about this, I am outlining a very possible situation with  Bitcoin -1.50%  where the  trend line  we have been on since early October breaks, reaching around a temporary low of $5000. This is examined on the  daily chart , since this is one of the best charts to examine trends of this size. I have to first and foremost say that I am not trying to spread fear, I know many people do not like to hear  bearish  ideas, but  technical analysis  is ultimately a rational exercise, and I feel that possibilities with very strong signs should be explored. 

There are a few things to look at, but I first want to talk about the big picture with, long-term  support and resistance  lines. I think most people can agree that there was a very significant downtrending resistance line that began from the peak of the  ATH 0.63%  in late December, to the low of around $6400 (thick red line). After the break from that line, it seems we moved into a sideways trend, bouncing back and forth between an emerging downtrending resistance line (light red) and a support line that we seem to have been respecting since mid-October (light green); at least this appears to be the case with the lows, where the angle's effectiveness appears very strongly. Finally, based on previous bounces, we can establish a support of around $5000-$5300 (I've thus created a small  support zone  around that range, in dark green), as well as lower supports around $3200 and $2000 (though I do not believe these will be reached, in dark green).   

Now, onto the analysis - it's no secret that  Bitcoin -1.50%  has been squeezing in, ready for a significant move either upwards or downwards. Initially I considered the upwards move to be more likely due to the significant media attention cryptocurrency has been receiving, but after viewing previous market cycles of  Bitcoin -1.50%  (check 2013), it seems clear to me that the  bearish  scenario of closing in on the market cycle is very likely, and should at the very least be prepared for with proper risk management. According to Dow Theory, which is said to have laid the foundations of modern  technical analysis , history repeats itself, and this is a situation where we forced to consider this. 

Should we break from the line, we will likely fall straight down to the $5000-$5000 area, where we will shoot back up and bounce towards around $6700 or so (maybe a little less). From there one, we will likely enter a sideways trend, which we will continue until we see higher highs and higher lows and parabolic movement returns, which could lead to us challenging the all-time high, and hitting $35k-$50k. 

NOTE: I seem to have reached the max character limit for this section of the idea, so I will continue my text below.

Comment:
					Onto the short-term: 


Scenario A: 

The reason why I have drawn this movement into a pennant is this way, is simply because we have been moving through this ascending triangle for quite a while now (May 23rd to today). I don't think that the pattern will be sufficient to directly lead into a strong sell-off, but we should consider that the size of ascending triangle suggests a small movement downwards at the very least, which can create a higher low, and thus move into position into a bearish pennant. Why would a bearish pennant occur here and not have a bounce to $8500-$8700? The reason is in positioning - the huge downtrend (May 5th to May 26th) creates a very nice flagpole in which it hits around the $5000 area very perfectly, and thus I would not be surprised if this happens. 

Second reason: on the Stoch RSI indicator on the daily chart, it appears to be dangerously high, which would suggest it being oversold. For the most part, it seems to have called lows and highs, at least to some extent. This overdrawn movement may very well have increased the likelyhood of Bitcoin being oversold. This could suggest that this is the last step into a sharp downturn, but this does not preclude Situation B. Volume has also been steadily decreasing, but this is the case with any sort of consolidation, I believe. 

Finally, the lines I have drawn below the triangle are simply bounces that I think seem fairly reasonable. The length from to support to the lines correlate with the length of the flagpole, of course, though it may seem chopped off due to the huge line from the long-term support downwards. 


Scenario B: 

This is much simpler, Bitcoin hits the upper resistance line, bounces off, challenges the lower support line, and we potentially see a break, and the rest unfolds from there. 


----------------------------------------------------------------------- 


With all this being said, do not fear if you are hoping for more parabolic movement - this likely will not be the end, and will simply be the set up for a long, drawn out sideways movement until the first signs of bullish activity begin and we start all over again. If you are longing around here, please consider using risk management, prepare for every possibility. If you are shorting, the same applies. 

Please trade with care. I wish the best to all traders!

Comment:
					This really is a very minor note, but I just want to emphasize that the rising wedge (which I erroneously refer to as an ascending triangle, a bad habit I have) entering a bearish pennant is more based on intuition than anything. Also, this pennant is mainly based on the conservative assumption that the break will happen at 7900, if it happens at 7700 where we seem to be general resistance, the pennant would look something like this:

Jun 7




I am Mid term-bullish on  BTC -1.50%  going into the end of this week, but looking to get into the market on a pull back to occur before I get in to the market.  The jury is still out as to whether this weekly bear trend is ready to turn around.  

We can see that both the  RSI  and  MFI  are both  Bullish  on the daily having bottomed when reaching oversold on both at c. $7k support where we found our longer term  trend line . 

We are currently in the process of meeting the Tenkan (blue line) as I write this, so in the very short term, I am looking for a pull back to $7550 range for an entry.  One of the main reasons for this is that on the 4hour timeframes we are close to completing an edge to edge trade so the risk reward doesn’t fit my profile, however a break out from the cloud or above the Tenkan around $7777 will make me enter the market. 

The  RSI  and  MFI  have both been excellent indicators in this bear market.  Whenever  RSI  has gone above the 60 and the  MFI  80; its time to exit the market from a  bullish  trade and consider shorting as it progresses higher.   

Based on the  RSI ,  MFI  trends and the fact that we will run into the Kijun at just around $8-8.2k, I will be scalling out at this  bearish  confluence level to start looking for pull backs and reassessment as i believe it to be a key point as  

Best case scenario this trade would yield a 10% return before leverage. 
This is for illustrative purposes only, please DYOR and goodluck with your trading.

So the pullback trade that we were looking at worked out & has made it's way back to the neckline level of structure. We are now at what i like to call a ""decision point"" Essentially IF price is able to violate this current level od structure THEN we're likely to continue to our next price projection.  

Something that a lot of newer traders don't understand is that when it comes to bigger moves, the market will often provide multiple opportunities to get involved. For those who don't rush and for those who don't get discouraged. If you perform consistent analysis you can often find multiple ways to involve yourself in a trade even if you missed the first strike.

My best idea ever, taking some time off the last 2 days :) The whales just continue to play their little games by squeezing leveraged short and long positions out of the market. Can't play them, it's just too easy. Maybe it's time we retail traders stand together, combine our  volume  and use their own game against them. Yeah, maybe we could even make a blockbuster movie about this :) I love me some science fiction :) LOL  

My last update of the previous analysis i showed 2 important support levels where the price could bounce up from. The first support around 7350 did the trick and the price got pushed back to 7700. From that point on i told my members that i thought i was seeing distribution, but it was still very confusing to figure out what was going on. TA was showing  bullish  signs, that  bull flag  was very strong and was even turning slowly up and was about to squeeze upwards. But of course out of no where the price got dumped, the move we saw a few hours ago. After that 200 point drop the price got pushed up again to 7700 like that dump was a glitch. If your a whale, why not push out leveraged traders and take your money while your accumulating or distributing. It's like a bonus, like the cherry on top :)  

Anyway, in this chart we can see allot of similarities of what is going on. As you know i have been saying i am still  bearish  for the medium term, but i just could not say what was going to happen on the short term. 2 days ago after we finally dropped out of that  wedge , i said we would have 2 options.  
- Break those 2 support levels from the last update of my previous chart (73xx and 71xx) 
- Make a higher low at those same support levels and make another move up above the high.  
 
As we can see in the chart, the  fractal  is not 100% identical so it's no guarantee that the 7700 high we just saw is the high already and that we start to move down. But based on this  fractal , i don't want to see the price get above the 7800/7900. This  fractal  confirms my  bearish  view as well. That's why TA is so great, you can turn any chart to fit your view :). 

Even without this  fractal , i just give it a very small chance that 7K price action is the fundament of a low to start another bull rally, i just highly doubt that. I want to see more  volume  to begin with and at least  double bottom  kind of formation. So the minimum i expect is a test of the 7100/6900in the coming week or 2. But the movement i have in mind for the med term is a drop below the 7K to form a big V shape low. If we get to see that, than i might even become  bullish  for the rest of the year :).  

As long as the price stays above the 73xx, we have to assume the bulls are still in control and we should see another wave up. So for me the 73xx is an important turning point.

Comment:
					At the moment it looks like bulls are trying to push higher, this bull flag/triangle is still very strong. So no sign of weakness yet! First small sign would be a drop below 7620/7600. Bulls need to break 7700

Comment:
					This is my bigger picture, think this bearish triangle is still 100% in play. I think if bulls can't break the 7800/7900 the bearish version is probably going to happen. Can't say HOW it will go, this blue line is just a guess. But a big V shape low would be the most bullish for the long term. I still think we are seeing distribution here. The only way this idea can be countered, is through a big increase of buying volume, if that doesn't happen, i think it's only a matter of time.

					Lower time frame we can see a new upwards channel and maybe even a rising wedge. From the looks of it, it's slowly going down to test the support line again. Depending on what will happen there we can make a better prediction for the rest of the day.

					What a surprise, nothing has changed :) 

The price took a small dump but the volume was low so no real read on what the intent was. So we might see another move up, if we start to see a small pump that takes out the 7800, be aware of a fake breakout. The blue line is a possibility of what the move could look like IF we move up and if the breakout fails. If that happens than we will probably get confirmation if the price breaks the 7600ish. If we break the 7800 it should stay above the 7700 to confirm another move up. Not much more to say about what's going on.

Comment:
					So we have made a small drop, but there is no volume confirming it, not yet at least. First small support has been broken, but not yet very meaningful because of the low volume. For the ones who shorted it, just be aware of another squeeze up, since this small move downwards looks a bit to controlled.  

Pure TA, it broke the channel and retested the former support as resistance now.

577,1528359434.0,Taiwan_Bear,2618 (Double top & 0.618 pull-back) - do not miss it!!,"
In the last couple of TAs I have mentioned the “2618 pattern” and have been asked what 2618 means. Sorry for taking it so long as it took me quite a while to put everything altogether. But, as promised, I have explained below the rules and trade setups for the 2618 pattern.  

What are the rules/setups/steps for 2618?  
1.	Form a  double top  (Note #1)  
2.	Neckline has to be broken  
3.	After price found support at point (b), wait for pull back to 0.618 fib retracement of (a)(b)  
4.	After price retraced to 0.618, look for confluence and sell (eg. Structures,  trendlines  ,  double top  on a lower time frame,  rsi  divergence,  bearish pin bar  ,  inside bar  break down etc.) (Note #2)  
5.	Stop loss to be set above  double top 
6.	Set Take Profit levels (Note #3)  

Note #1 ( Double top ):  
The first step for the formation of 2618 is to form a  double top  at key resistance levels. Why at key resistance levels? Because we want to avoid fake double tops which can occur occasionally.  

There are some variations between various resources (books, websites) regarding the definitions of “double top”. The main differences occur where:  
a)	Some said for a  double top  to be valid, the wick of the 2nd top cannot exceed the wick of the 1st top; whereas, others said:  
b)	The wick of the 2nd top can exceed the wick of the 1st top but the candle close of the 2nd top CANNOT exceed the wick of the 1st top; or  
c)	The wick of the 2nd top can exceed the wick of the 1st top and the candle close of the 2nd top CAN exceed the wick of the 1st top; or  
d)	The wick of the 2nd top meets at least the candle close of the 1st top; or  
e)	The body of the 2nd top cannot exceed the body of the 1st top  

Personally, I would say all the above definitions work just fine although I do prefer definition a) because it means that the selling pressure is strong and the bulls fail to make a higher high. When there is a higher high formed in a downtrend, it can mean the downtrend has reversed and therefore you might not want to sell when the price pulls back to the 0.618 fib retracement.  

Note #2 ( 0.618 retracement ):  
When the price pulls back to 0.618, it does not mean to sell straight away. There must be more than one reason to sell other than the 0.618 retrace. The more reasons the better. In this example, you can see there are certainly structures (key resistance levels) at the 0.618 retrace. As well, there was a  double top  formed on the lower time frame. Consequently, you can sell.  

After  BTC -1.49%  hit the 0.618 retrace the first time, the price dropped from $9735 to $8650. but quickly bounced back to the 0.618 retrace level. That was a second & better opportunity to sell. Not only did  BTC -1.49%  form a  double top  on the larger time frame, but also with a  bearish  divergence on the 4hr time frame. Accordingly, you have more reasons to sell.  

Note #3 (Set take profit)  
Same as the rules of “Double top”, there are some variations as to which price level should you take profits. Personally, I would stick to the below:  
1)	First, take profit when risk/reward ratio hits 1:1 (recommend to take 30% - 50% profits and adjust the SL of the remaining positions to break-even)  
2)	When price hits the same price level as the low after the neckline is broken ((b) point in this example)  
3)	When price hits 1.272 fib extension of (a)(b)  
4)	When price hits point (d) (using  AB=CD  pattern. If you are not sure what the rules of  AB=CD  are, you can refer to my previous TA in which I have attached the link below)  
5)	If in a one-way market (heavily bearish/bullish), you can always keep 10% to 20% of your positions and take profits when risk/reward ratio hits 1:5 or even 1:10

 BTC -1.49%  is on the verge of breaking to a daily higher high on the bounce if the bulls can see a push this morning. 
If we reject from here the daily will form a lower high and we will see a tightening pattern within the highlighted  support and resistance  lines.  
Important for the bulls to show up or we could stay in this range into tomorrow.  
Healthy consolidation after the most recent bull move and the 15 min chart needs to change the trend.  
Also look to  EMA  12 support on the 4 hour and hourly.  
Another morning like yesterday with the bulls comfortable as worst case, we likely stay in the tightening pattern if bulls cannot prove themselves.

The current situation of  Bitcoin -1.49%  is quite difficult. We are on a clear treshold. A lot of traders are saying that we are on a clear downtrend, but the same amount of people are claiming that we will have our reversal soon. 

This article tries to sum up all important information you have to need! 

1: Retracement of a parabolic uptrend: 
There is a rule of thumb for the retracement of a parabolic uptrend. We should retrace to approx. the 0.786  Fibonacci Retracement  +/- 10%! 
Depending where we start the count, we are already in that target. Although both ways (blue and red) have still some space for a further downwave! 







2: The bloody support of Bitcoin: 
The average cost of mining one  bitcoin -1.49%  are at USA/Russia approx. 4700$ and at 3100$ for china! 
A drop below a target of 4700$ would be savage. Nevertheless, i can't image that we will hit that target. 







3: Manipulation of  Bitcoin -1.49%  and the Bart Simpson Pattern: 
A friend of mine found some unusual patterns in the orderbooks of several exchanges: 
https://twitter.com/CryptoSyndrome 
Altcoins are manipulated on a daily basis. It seems that  bitcoin -1.49%  is now affected to this too, which causes all these 3-5% pump and dumps. 
Thus, we are forming all the time the Bartin Simpsons Patterns. 

4: Similarity to 2014: 
Bitcoin -1.49%  now: 






Bitcoin -1.49%  2014: 







5: Deminishing downtrend and a strong support 
If we see the falling  wedges  as the force of the downtrend, then the force is diminishing! 
Furthermore we have strong support which is holding now for the 4th time! 







6: The Indicators 
Having a look at the indicators at 2D, we have a good potential for an upwave now. 
The  volume  is deminishing which should indicate a breakout soon. 
The  MACD  is about to cross, the  RSI  was slightly overbought and is heading up like the  Stoch .  RSI . 
The 200  EMA  is slighty under the current price and act as a support. 

7: The symetrical Triangle 
The theory says, that we should have in a  sym -1.72% . triangle 5 times an  ABC  wave. The waves are not perfect, but we can construct them. 






As you can see, the last four ABC-Waves formed always a 1:1 extention, which indicates that we have finished wave 5. 

8: A possible Head and Shoulders 
Even if this is not the most perfect  Head and Shoulders  Pattern, it's still valid! 
We are currently at the neckline, which is a strong and important resistance. Breaking upwards should indicate a good uptrend. 







9: The magic  6th 0.00%  of the month 






Suprisingly we have on every  6th 0.00%  of the month a reversal. Why is that??? 
One reason could be the  CME Group Futures  with dates for the settlements always nearby the  6th 0.00%  of the month! 
http://www.cmegroup.com 

10: Longterm  Bullish  TA 
The whole pattern could be seen as a big  bullish pennant . 







11: Shortterm  Bullish  TA 
Leading diagonal  starting wave1 of an  Elliott Wave , since we have now an impulse wave, after the 5x  ABC  pattern inside the triangle is finished. 
Our target should be at the top of the triangle nearby 8600-8800$. 







12: Longterm  Bearish  TA 
We also can argue, that we are currenty in an downtrend and the  sym -1.72% . triangle just continuing the trend. 
Our target should be nearby 6000$ which is also a finished downwards  Elliott Wave .

Nothing is happening in the market:  volatility  has become extinct and coins' trading fallen out of fashion. Range-bound bots and robotic humans absolutely prosper in this environment. The price was unable to break the 7700 threshold. For me this is a  bearish  signal. Indicators provide mixed signals, so let's examine wave structure. The move from May 29 is a  3-wave -0.12%  correction within a larger downtrend. A price drop below 7500 would confirm this scenario.

Comment:
					Impulse Wave Truncation (Truncated Fifth) - 
Truncated 5th wave is when the market has become so over-extended in Wave 3 that there is not much force left for the impulse wave to come to a proper completion. So when this happens, there is a chance that the last wave of the impulse, Wave 5, will not reach the end of Wave 3 before the market starts correcting in the opposite direction. At this point, the market is just too exhausted. This condition is often called a “failure” or a “Truncation.”

I can see many people still believe that we are going inside a  descending triangle . I also believed this in my idea that i shard on may 1st: 



 

Things can change so quickly and if we didn't adapt to the changes then someone will. That's why i believe that we have to be in fast adapt mode in this market. Doesn't mean that you need to change without checking yourself. I try to find 2-3 confirmations before i change my idea on something. This includes pattern changes, trend changes etc 

There are 21 corrective wave patterns in EW which is categorized into major 3 corrective wave patterns: 

Zigzag  (5-3-5) 
Flat (3-3-5) 
Triangle (3-3-3-3-3) 

And other patterns are combinations of the above which is:  

Double three (A combination of two corrective patterns above) 
Triple three (A combination of three corrective patterns above) 

So what i can see now is that we are in two double three combination corrective wave pattern: 








More info here:  

https://elliottwave-forecast.com/elliott-wave-theory/#corrective-waves 

Confirmations: 

1. Wave ((i)) of C is 1.6k and ((v)) is going to be completed below the triangle 
2. Wave (E) of the triangle can't go beyond the triangle.  
3. This has happened twice before in 2013 & 2015 

Each wave  got 3 subwaves (a,b &c) inside and we are in the subwave c of ((y)) of Y which is an impulsive wave. 

Impulsive waves: 1,3,5,a,c 
Corrective waves: 2,4,b 

Normal Fibo Ratios for these waves are: 

wave 2 = 0.5 - 0.8 of wave 1  
wave 3 = 1.236 - 1.618 of wave 1  
wave 4 = 0.5 - 0.618 of wave 3  
wave 5 = 0.618 - 1 of wave 1  
wave B = 0.5 - 0.8 of wave A  
wave C = 0.618 - 1.236 of wave A  

Now if you check what happened in subwave a of ((y)) of Y you can see that: 

Wave (i) of a: 985$ 
Wave (ii) of a: 434$  
Wave ( iii -0.44% ) of a: 1207$  
Wave (iv) of a: 691$ [~0.618 of Wave ( iii -0.44% )] 
Wave (v) of a: 950$  








I have seen  BTC -1.49%  impulsive waves fibo ratios almost the same as the previous impulsive wave fibo ratios. 
Now if you apply the same for the last wave C of (E) this is what you get: 

Wave ((i)) of c: 1587$ 
Wave ((ii)) of c  = 793$ 
Wave (( iii -0.44% )) of c  = 1961$ 
Wave ((iv)) of c [~0.618 of Wave (( iii -0.44% ))] = 1212$ 
Wave ((v)) of c  = 1587$ 








Also note that Wave ((iv)) might not retrace upto 0.618 of Wave (( iii -0.44% )) as everyone will be in panic mode by that time so minimum retracement would be around 0.386 of Wave (( iii -0.44% )) which is around 756$ and this is why i can see it goes down to 5k level or little bit more towards 4.7k which is the lowest level of the  support zone  (orange dotted lines) 








So 3 Possible Support lines for reversal would be 

1. Blue: 5800 - 6100 (Only possible if Wave ((v)) is truncated) 
2. Orange: 4700 - 5000 (This is most likely where we heading)  
3. Red: 4100 - 4400 (Only possible if Wave (( iii -0.44% )) is extended)

 Bitcoin -1.49%  has recently developed an interesting pattern of completing a  bullish  and  bearish  cycle on the sixth of every month in an alternating order. As we can see in the chart above, a fall is followed by a rise. This has happened twice before and is expected to happen again now on the  6th 0.00%  of June, 2018. This time  Bitcoin -1.49%  will finish a  bearish  cycle and I expected to begin the next  bullish  cycle at least till the end of  6th 0.00%  of July, 2018. 

This pattern of rise and fall is also supported by other patterns on the chart that signal a  bullish  reversal. The support line has also held firmly and if this pattern of alternating rise and fall ensues,  Bitcoin -1.49%  could very well make new highs by the end of the year. The  RSI  is recovering from oversold levels and has now approached a normal.  Bitcoin -1.49%  is currently at a favorable point for  bullish  entries. The price broke a long term resistance as it break past the downtrend line in April, 2018. This was a big accomplishment for the bulls but the lack of confidence pulled the price back to the support line. Currently, the price is just above the support line and appears to be all set for a  bullish  comeback but the reality is, there are not enough bulls in the market. 

The past few months have been devastating for the price of  Bitcoin -1.49%  ( BTC -1.49% ) and a lot of investors are still running scared. Institutional investors are looking for more clarity regarding regulations concerning cryptocurrencies and also safer ways to invest and store their coins. As for retail investors, most of them comprise of first time investors who have never traded any financial asset before. So, when they saw that  Bitcoin -1.49%  ( BTC -1.49% ) is making 20% gains every day, they thought this could go on forever and jumped with both feet, only to find the carpet pulled under from their feet. Big investors have always played small investors as cannon fodder and have gotten away with their schemes even in regulated markets like forex or the stock market. Cryptocurrencies is a new market with no proper regulations which means it is natural to expect that those who can afford to not play by the rules, most likely won’t.

Hello friends,  

It's been a while since my last post; lack of time and an urge to do more research has mainly driven me to take a break from posting ideas on TradingView. I am still in the process of doing more research and study, but I figure posting once in a while couldn't hurt. 

Since I have become recently very convinced about this, I am outlining a very possible situation with  Bitcoin -1.45%  where the  trend line  we have been on since early October breaks, reaching around a temporary low of $5000. This is examined on the  daily chart , since this is one of the best charts to examine trends of this size. I have to first and foremost say that I am not trying to spread fear, I know many people do not like to hear  bearish  ideas, but  technical analysis  is ultimately a rational exercise, and I feel that possibilities with very strong signs should be explored. 

There are a few things to look at, but I first want to talk about the big picture with, long-term  support and resistance  lines. I think most people can agree that there was a very significant downtrending resistance line that began from the peak of the  ATH 0.63%  in late December, to the low of around $6400 (thick red line). After the break from that line, it seems we moved into a sideways trend, bouncing back and forth between an emerging downtrending resistance line (light red) and a support line that we seem to have been respecting since mid-October (light green); at least this appears to be the case with the lows, where the angle's effectiveness appears very strongly. Finally, based on previous bounces, we can establish a support of around $5000-$5300 (I've thus created a small  support zone  around that range, in dark green), as well as lower supports around $3200 and $2000 (though I do not believe these will be reached, in dark green).   

Now, onto the analysis - it's no secret that  Bitcoin -1.45%  has been squeezing in, ready for a significant move either upwards or downwards. Initially I considered the upwards move to be more likely due to the significant media attention cryptocurrency has been receiving, but after viewing previous market cycles of  Bitcoin -1.45%  (check 2013), it seems clear to me that the  bearish  scenario of closing in on the market cycle is very likely, and should at the very least be prepared for with proper risk management. According to Dow Theory, which is said to have laid the foundations of modern  technical analysis , history repeats itself, and this is a situation where we forced to consider this. 

Should we break from the line, we will likely fall straight down to the $5000-$5000 area, where we will shoot back up and bounce towards around $6700 or so (maybe a little less). From there one, we will likely enter a sideways trend, which we will continue until we see higher highs and higher lows and parabolic movement returns, which could lead to us challenging the all-time high, and hitting $35k-$50k. 

NOTE: I seem to have reached the max character limit for this section of the idea, so I will continue my text below.

Comment:
					Onto the short-term: 


Scenario A: 

The reason why I have drawn this movement into a pennant is this way, is simply because we have been moving through this ascending triangle for quite a while now (May 23rd to today). I don't think that the pattern will be sufficient to directly lead into a strong sell-off, but we should consider that the size of ascending triangle suggests a small movement downwards at the very least, which can create a higher low, and thus move into position into a bearish pennant. Why would a bearish pennant occur here and not have a bounce to $8500-$8700? The reason is in positioning - the huge downtrend (May 5th to May 26th) creates a very nice flagpole in which it hits around the $5000 area very perfectly, and thus I would not be surprised if this happens. 

Second reason: on the Stoch RSI indicator on the daily chart, it appears to be dangerously high, which would suggest it being oversold. For the most part, it seems to have called lows and highs, at least to some extent. This overdrawn movement may very well have increased the likelyhood of Bitcoin being oversold. This could suggest that this is the last step into a sharp downturn, but this does not preclude Situation B. Volume has also been steadily decreasing, but this is the case with any sort of consolidation, I believe. 

Finally, the lines I have drawn below the triangle are simply bounces that I think seem fairly reasonable. The length from to support to the lines correlate with the length of the flagpole, of course, though it may seem chopped off due to the huge line from the long-term support downwards. 


Scenario B: 

This is much simpler, Bitcoin hits the upper resistance line, bounces off, challenges the lower support line, and we potentially see a break, and the rest unfolds from there. 


----------------------------------------------------------------------- 


With all this being said, do not fear if you are hoping for more parabolic movement - this likely will not be the end, and will simply be the set up for a long, drawn out sideways movement until the first signs of bullish activity begin and we start all over again. If you are longing around here, please consider using risk management, prepare for every possibility. If you are shorting, the same applies. 

Please trade with care. I wish the best to all traders!

Comment:
					This really is a very minor note, but I just want to emphasize that the rising wedge (which I erroneously refer to as an ascending triangle, a bad habit I have) entering a bearish pennant is more based on intuition than anything. Also, this pennant is mainly based on the conservative assumption that the break will happen at 7900, if it happens at 7700 where we seem to be general resistance, the pennant would look something like this:

I am Mid term-bullish on  BTC -1.44%  going into the end of this week, but looking to get into the market on a pull back to occur before I get in to the market.  The jury is still out as to whether this weekly bear trend is ready to turn around.  

We can see that both the  RSI  and  MFI  are both  Bullish  on the daily having bottomed when reaching oversold on both at c. $7k support where we found our longer term  trend line . 

We are currently in the process of meeting the Tenkan (blue line) as I write this, so in the very short term, I am looking for a pull back to $7550 range for an entry.  One of the main reasons for this is that on the 4hour timeframes we are close to completing an edge to edge trade so the risk reward doesn’t fit my profile, however a break out from the cloud or above the Tenkan around $7777 will make me enter the market. 

The  RSI  and  MFI  have both been excellent indicators in this bear market.  Whenever  RSI  has gone above the 60 and the  MFI  80; its time to exit the market from a  bullish  trade and consider shorting as it progresses higher.   

Based on the  RSI ,  MFI  trends and the fact that we will run into the Kijun at just around $8-8.2k, I will be scalling out at this  bearish  confluence level to start looking for pull backs and reassessment as i believe it to be a key point as  

Best case scenario this trade would yield a 10% return before leverage. 
This is for illustrative purposes only, please DYOR and goodluck with your trading.

So the pullback trade that we were looking at worked out & has made it's way back to the neckline level of structure. We are now at what i like to call a ""decision point"" Essentially IF price is able to violate this current level od structure THEN we're likely to continue to our next price projection.  

Something that a lot of newer traders don't understand is that when it comes to bigger moves, the market will often provide multiple opportunities to get involved. For those who don't rush and for those who don't get discouraged. If you perform consistent analysis you can often find multiple ways to involve yourself in a trade even if you missed the first strike.

This is the way markets move, If you question my charting check my previous posts. Its as simple as pie. We are going down, How long and how far is too soon to say. Here is a chart that we can understand the future price action and where to buy back. Before you guys start blasting my comment section with the time and how it may not be right thats correct. I am not calculating the time I'm just making a technical drawing of the directions that we will see in the next few months.  

Recent price action has clear signs of wash trading / market manipulation fud and lots of nonsense. Its hard to prove almost impossible so as a trader we just need to deal with it. Ideally the situation you are supposed to trade are critical break up and break down points to enter the trade. Dont enter or exit dumb trades and lose money. As an experienced trader you should be looking for shorts, I would not consider a long unless we are over $10-12k

I am never good with words so instead of writing paragraphs of clarification to justify my call for SHORT since my last posting, I have explained everything on my chart with the least words possible using Fibonacci. It does not matter how popular  Bitcoin -1.47%  has become, or how deep it has disrupted the financial sector, or how many institutional investors have come to invest in it -- the psychology behind a market cycle does not change. 

I don't really encourage anyone to short  Bitcoin -1.47% , but in all honesty, don't expect the bulls to fly anytime soon. Like I said before, this correction that we are having right now is the ""MOTHER OF ALL CORRECTIONS"" after a 4-year-long bull cycle since the 2013 correction... and we are just halfway through.

My best idea ever, taking some time off the last 2 days :) The whales just continue to play their little games by squeezing leveraged short and long positions out of the market. Can't play them, it's just too easy. Maybe it's time we retail traders stand together, combine our  volume  and use their own game against them. Yeah, maybe we could even make a blockbuster movie about this :) I love me some science fiction :) LOL  

My last update of the previous analysis i showed 2 important support levels where the price could bounce up from. The first support around 7350 did the trick and the price got pushed back to 7700. From that point on i told my members that i thought i was seeing distribution, but it was still very confusing to figure out what was going on. TA was showing  bullish  signs, that  bull flag  was very strong and was even turning slowly up and was about to squeeze upwards. But of course out of no where the price got dumped, the move we saw a few hours ago. After that 200 point drop the price got pushed up again to 7700 like that dump was a glitch. If your a whale, why not push out leveraged traders and take your money while your accumulating or distributing. It's like a bonus, like the cherry on top :)  

Anyway, in this chart we can see allot of similarities of what is going on. As you know i have been saying i am still  bearish  for the medium term, but i just could not say what was going to happen on the short term. 2 days ago after we finally dropped out of that  wedge , i said we would have 2 options.  
- Break those 2 support levels from the last update of my previous chart (73xx and 71xx) 
- Make a higher low at those same support levels and make another move up above the high.  
 
As we can see in the chart, the  fractal  is not 100% identical so it's no guarantee that the 7700 high we just saw is the high already and that we start to move down. But based on this  fractal , i don't want to see the price get above the 7800/7900. This  fractal  confirms my  bearish  view as well. That's why TA is so great, you can turn any chart to fit your view :). 

Even without this  fractal , i just give it a very small chance that 7K price action is the fundament of a low to start another bull rally, i just highly doubt that. I want to see more  volume  to begin with and at least  double bottom  kind of formation. So the minimum i expect is a test of the 7100/6900in the coming week or 2. But the movement i have in mind for the med term is a drop below the 7K to form a big V shape low. If we get to see that, than i might even become  bullish  for the rest of the year :).  

As long as the price stays above the 73xx, we have to assume the bulls are still in control and we should see another wave up. So for me the 73xx is an important turning point.

					At the moment it looks like bulls are trying to push higher, this bull flag/triangle is still very strong. So no sign of weakness yet! First small sign would be a drop below 7620/7600. Bulls need to break 7700

Comment:
					This is my bigger picture, think this bearish triangle is still 100% in play. I think if bulls can't break the 7800/7900 the bearish version is probably going to happen. Can't say HOW it will go, this blue line is just a guess. But a big V shape low would be the most bullish for the long term. I still think we are seeing distribution here. The only way this idea can be countered, is through a big increase of buying volume, if that doesn't happen, i think it's only a matter of time.

Comment:
					What a surprise, nothing has changed :) 

The price took a small dump but the volume was low so no real read on what the intent was. So we might see another move up, if we start to see a small pump that takes out the 7800, be aware of a fake breakout. The blue line is a possibility of what the move could look like IF we move up and if the breakout fails. If that happens than we will probably get confirmation if the price breaks the 7600ish. If we break the 7800 it should stay above the 7700 to confirm another move up. Not much more to say about what's going on.

Comment:
					So we have made a small drop, but there is no volume confirming it, not yet at least. First small support has been broken, but not yet very meaningful because of the low volume. For the ones who shorted it, just be aware of another squeeze up, since this small move downwards looks a bit to controlled.  

Pure TA, it broke the channel and retested the former support as resistance now.

595,1528359434.0,Taiwan_Bear,2618 (Double top & 0.618 pull-back) - do not miss it!!,"
In the last couple of TAs I have mentioned the “2618 pattern” and have been asked what 2618 means. Sorry for taking it so long as it took me quite a while to put everything altogether. But, as promised, I have explained below the rules and trade setups for the 2618 pattern.  

What are the rules/setups/steps for 2618?  
1.	Form a  double top  (Note #1)  
2.	Neckline has to be broken  
3.	After price found support at point (b), wait for pull back to 0.618 fib retracement of (a)(b)  
4.	After price retraced to 0.618, look for confluence and sell (eg. Structures,  trendlines  ,  double top  on a lower time frame,  rsi  divergence,  bearish pin bar  ,  inside bar  break down etc.) (Note #2)  
5.	Stop loss to be set above  double top 
6.	Set Take Profit levels (Note #3)  

Note #1 ( Double top ):  
The first step for the formation of 2618 is to form a  double top  at key resistance levels. Why at key resistance levels? Because we want to avoid fake double tops which can occur occasionally.  

There are some variations between various resources (books, websites) regarding the definitions of “double top”. The main differences occur where:  
a)	Some said for a  double top  to be valid, the wick of the 2nd top cannot exceed the wick of the 1st top; whereas, others said:  
b)	The wick of the 2nd top can exceed the wick of the 1st top but the candle close of the 2nd top CANNOT exceed the wick of the 1st top; or  
c)	The wick of the 2nd top can exceed the wick of the 1st top and the candle close of the 2nd top CAN exceed the wick of the 1st top; or  
d)	The wick of the 2nd top meets at least the candle close of the 1st top; or  
e)	The body of the 2nd top cannot exceed the body of the 1st top  

Personally, I would say all the above definitions work just fine although I do prefer definition a) because it means that the selling pressure is strong and the bulls fail to make a higher high. When there is a higher high formed in a downtrend, it can mean the downtrend has reversed and therefore you might not want to sell when the price pulls back to the 0.618 fib retracement.  

Note #2 ( 0.618 retracement ):  
When the price pulls back to 0.618, it does not mean to sell straight away. There must be more than one reason to sell other than the 0.618 retrace. The more reasons the better. In this example, you can see there are certainly structures (key resistance levels) at the 0.618 retrace. As well, there was a  double top  formed on the lower time frame. Consequently, you can sell.  

After  BTC -1.45%  hit the 0.618 retrace the first time, the price dropped from $9735 to $8650. but quickly bounced back to the 0.618 retrace level. That was a second & better opportunity to sell. Not only did  BTC -1.45%  form a  double top  on the larger time frame, but also with a  bearish  divergence on the 4hr time frame. Accordingly, you have more reasons to sell.  

Note #3 (Set take profit)  
Same as the rules of “Double top”, there are some variations as to which price level should you take profits. Personally, I would stick to the below:  
1)	First, take profit when risk/reward ratio hits 1:1 (recommend to take 30% - 50% profits and adjust the SL of the remaining positions to break-even)  
2)	When price hits the same price level as the low after the neckline is broken ((b) point in this example)  
3)	When price hits 1.272 fib extension of (a)(b)  
4)	When price hits point (d) (using  AB=CD  pattern. If you are not sure what the rules of  AB=CD  are, you can refer to my previous TA in which I have attached the link below)  
5)	If in a one-way market (heavily bearish/bullish), you can always keep 10% to 20% of your positions and take profits when risk/reward ratio hits 1:5 or even 1:10

 BTC -1.47%  is on the verge of breaking to a daily higher high on the bounce if the bulls can see a push this morning. 
If we reject from here the daily will form a lower high and we will see a tightening pattern within the highlighted  support and resistance  lines.  
Important for the bulls to show up or we could stay in this range into tomorrow.  
Healthy consolidation after the most recent bull move and the 15 min chart needs to change the trend.  
Also look to  EMA  12 support on the 4 hour and hourly.  
Another morning like yesterday with the bulls comfortable as worst case, we likely stay in the tightening pattern if bulls cannot prove themselves.

The current situation of  Bitcoin -1.47%  is quite difficult. We are on a clear treshold. A lot of traders are saying that we are on a clear downtrend, but the same amount of people are claiming that we will have our reversal soon. 

This article tries to sum up all important information you have to need! 

1: Retracement of a parabolic uptrend: 
There is a rule of thumb for the retracement of a parabolic uptrend. We should retrace to approx. the 0.786  Fibonacci Retracement  +/- 10%! 
Depending where we start the count, we are already in that target. Although both ways (blue and red) have still some space for a further downwave! 







2: The bloody support of Bitcoin: 
The average cost of mining one  bitcoin -1.47%  are at USA/Russia approx. 4700$ and at 3100$ for china! 
A drop below a target of 4700$ would be savage. Nevertheless, i can't image that we will hit that target. 







3: Manipulation of  Bitcoin -1.47%  and the Bart Simpson Pattern: 
A friend of mine found some unusual patterns in the orderbooks of several exchanges: 
https://twitter.com/CryptoSyndrome 
Altcoins are manipulated on a daily basis. It seems that  bitcoin -1.47%  is now affected to this too, which causes all these 3-5% pump and dumps. 
Thus, we are forming all the time the Bartin Simpsons Patterns. 

4: Similarity to 2014: 
Bitcoin -1.47%  now: 






Bitcoin -1.47%  2014: 







5: Deminishing downtrend and a strong support 
If we see the falling  wedges  as the force of the downtrend, then the force is diminishing! 
Furthermore we have strong support which is holding now for the 4th time! 







6: The Indicators 
Having a look at the indicators at 2D, we have a good potential for an upwave now. 
The  volume  is deminishing which should indicate a breakout soon. 
The  MACD  is about to cross, the  RSI  was slightly overbought and is heading up like the  Stoch .  RSI . 
The 200  EMA  is slighty under the current price and act as a support. 

7: The symetrical Triangle 
The theory says, that we should have in a  sym -1.72% . triangle 5 times an  ABC  wave. The waves are not perfect, but we can construct them. 






As you can see, the last four ABC-Waves formed always a 1:1 extention, which indicates that we have finished wave 5. 

8: A possible Head and Shoulders 
Even if this is not the most perfect  Head and Shoulders  Pattern, it's still valid! 
We are currently at the neckline, which is a strong and important resistance. Breaking upwards should indicate a good uptrend. 







9: The magic  6th 0.00%  of the month 






Suprisingly we have on every  6th 0.00%  of the month a reversal. Why is that??? 
One reason could be the  CME Group Futures  with dates for the settlements always nearby the  6th 0.00%  of the month! 
http://www.cmegroup.com 

10: Longterm  Bullish  TA 
The whole pattern could be seen as a big  bullish pennant . 







11: Shortterm  Bullish  TA 
Leading diagonal  starting wave1 of an  Elliott Wave , since we have now an impulse wave, after the 5x  ABC  pattern inside the triangle is finished. 
Our target should be at the top of the triangle nearby 8600-8800$. 







12: Longterm  Bearish  TA 
We also can argue, that we are currenty in an downtrend and the  sym -1.72% . triangle just continuing the trend. 
Our target should be nearby 6000$ which is also a finished downwards  Elliott Wave .

Nothing is happening in the market:  volatility  has become extinct and coins' trading fallen out of fashion. Range-bound bots and robotic humans absolutely prosper in this environment. The price was unable to break the 7700 threshold. For me this is a  bearish  signal. Indicators provide mixed signals, so let's examine wave structure. The move from May 29 is a  3-wave -0.12%  correction within a larger downtrend. A price drop below 7500 would confirm this scenario.

					Impulse Wave Truncation (Truncated Fifth) - 
Truncated 5th wave is when the market has become so over-extended in Wave 3 that there is not much force left for the impulse wave to come to a proper completion. So when this happens, there is a chance that the last wave of the impulse, Wave 5, will not reach the end of Wave 3 before the market starts correcting in the opposite direction. At this point, the market is just too exhausted. This condition is often called a “failure” or a “Truncation.”

I can see many people still believe that we are going inside a  descending triangle . I also believed this in my idea that i shard on may 1st: 



 

Things can change so quickly and if we didn't adapt to the changes then someone will. That's why i believe that we have to be in fast adapt mode in this market. Doesn't mean that you need to change without checking yourself. I try to find 2-3 confirmations before i change my idea on something. This includes pattern changes, trend changes etc 

There are 21 corrective wave patterns in EW which is categorized into major 3 corrective wave patterns: 

Zigzag  (5-3-5) 
Flat (3-3-5) 
Triangle (3-3-3-3-3) 

And other patterns are combinations of the above which is:  

Double three (A combination of two corrective patterns above) 
Triple three (A combination of three corrective patterns above) 

So what i can see now is that we are in two double three combination corrective wave pattern:

Confirmations: 

1. Wave ((i)) of C is 1.6k and ((v)) is going to be completed below the triangle 
2. Wave (E) of the triangle can't go beyond the triangle.  
3. This has happened twice before in 2013 & 2015 

Each wave  got 3 subwaves (a,b &c) inside and we are in the subwave c of ((y)) of Y which is an impulsive wave. 

Impulsive waves: 1,3,5,a,c 
Corrective waves: 2,4,b 

Normal Fibo Ratios for these waves are: 

wave 2 = 0.5 - 0.8 of wave 1  
wave 3 = 1.236 - 1.618 of wave 1  
wave 4 = 0.5 - 0.618 of wave 3  
wave 5 = 0.618 - 1 of wave 1  
wave B = 0.5 - 0.8 of wave A  
wave C = 0.618 - 1.236 of wave A  

Now if you check what happened in subwave a of ((y)) of Y you can see that: 

Wave (i) of a: 985$ 
Wave (ii) of a: 434$  
Wave ( iii -0.45% ) of a: 1207$  
Wave (iv) of a: 691$ [~0.618 of Wave ( iii -0.45% )] 
Wave (v) of a: 950$  








I have seen  BTC -1.51%  impulsive waves fibo ratios almost the same as the previous impulsive wave fibo ratios. 
Now if you apply the same for the last wave C of (E) this is what you get: 

Wave ((i)) of c: 1587$ 
Wave ((ii)) of c  = 793$ 
Wave (( iii -0.45% )) of c  = 1961$ 
Wave ((iv)) of c [~0.618 of Wave (( iii -0.45% ))] = 1212$ 
Wave ((v)) of c  = 1587$ 








Also note that Wave ((iv)) might not retrace upto 0.618 of Wave (( iii -0.45% )) as everyone will be in panic mode by that time so minimum retracement would be around 0.386 of Wave (( iii -0.45% )) which is around 756$ and this is why i can see it goes down to 5k level or little bit more towards 4.7k which is the lowest level of the  support zone  (orange dotted lines) 








So 3 Possible Support lines for reversal would be 

1. Blue: 5800 - 6100 (Only possible if Wave ((v)) is truncated) 
2. Orange: 4700 - 5000 (This is most likely where we heading)  
3. Red: 4100 - 4400 (Only possible if Wave (( iii -0.45% )) is extended)

 Bitcoin -1.50%  has recently developed an interesting pattern of completing a  bullish  and  bearish  cycle on the sixth of every month in an alternating order. As we can see in the chart above, a fall is followed by a rise. This has happened twice before and is expected to happen again now on the  6th 0.00%  of June, 2018. This time  Bitcoin -1.50%  will finish a  bearish  cycle and I expected to begin the next  bullish  cycle at least till the end of  6th 0.00%  of July, 2018. 

This pattern of rise and fall is also supported by other patterns on the chart that signal a  bullish  reversal. The support line has also held firmly and if this pattern of alternating rise and fall ensues,  Bitcoin -1.50%  could very well make new highs by the end of the year. The  RSI  is recovering from oversold levels and has now approached a normal.  Bitcoin -1.50%  is currently at a favorable point for  bullish  entries. The price broke a long term resistance as it break past the downtrend line in April, 2018. This was a big accomplishment for the bulls but the lack of confidence pulled the price back to the support line. Currently, the price is just above the support line and appears to be all set for a  bullish  comeback but the reality is, there are not enough bulls in the market. 

The past few months have been devastating for the price of  Bitcoin -1.50%  ( BTC -1.50% ) and a lot of investors are still running scared. Institutional investors are looking for more clarity regarding regulations concerning cryptocurrencies and also safer ways to invest and store their coins. As for retail investors, most of them comprise of first time investors who have never traded any financial asset before. So, when they saw that  Bitcoin -1.50%  ( BTC -1.50% ) is making 20% gains every day, they thought this could go on forever and jumped with both feet, only to find the carpet pulled under from their feet. Big investors have always played small investors as cannon fodder and have gotten away with their schemes even in regulated markets like forex or the stock market. Cryptocurrencies is a new market with no proper regulations which means it is natural to expect that those who can afford to not play by the rules, most likely won’t.

Hello friends,  

It's been a while since my last post; lack of time and an urge to do more research has mainly driven me to take a break from posting ideas on TradingView. I am still in the process of doing more research and study, but I figure posting once in a while couldn't hurt. 

Since I have become recently very convinced about this, I am outlining a very possible situation with  Bitcoin -1.51%  where the  trend line  we have been on since early October breaks, reaching around a temporary low of $5000. This is examined on the  daily chart , since this is one of the best charts to examine trends of this size. I have to first and foremost say that I am not trying to spread fear, I know many people do not like to hear  bearish  ideas, but  technical analysis  is ultimately a rational exercise, and I feel that possibilities with very strong signs should be explored. 

There are a few things to look at, but I first want to talk about the big picture with, long-term  support and resistance  lines. I think most people can agree that there was a very significant downtrending resistance line that began from the peak of the  ATH 0.63%  in late December, to the low of around $6400 (thick red line). After the break from that line, it seems we moved into a sideways trend, bouncing back and forth between an emerging downtrending resistance line (light red) and a support line that we seem to have been respecting since mid-October (light green); at least this appears to be the case with the lows, where the angle's effectiveness appears very strongly. Finally, based on previous bounces, we can establish a support of around $5000-$5300 (I've thus created a small  support zone  around that range, in dark green), as well as lower supports around $3200 and $2000 (though I do not believe these will be reached, in dark green).   

Now, onto the analysis - it's no secret that  Bitcoin -1.51%  has been squeezing in, ready for a significant move either upwards or downwards. Initially I considered the upwards move to be more likely due to the significant media attention cryptocurrency has been receiving, but after viewing previous market cycles of  Bitcoin -1.51%  (check 2013), it seems clear to me that the  bearish  scenario of closing in on the market cycle is very likely, and should at the very least be prepared for with proper risk management. According to Dow Theory, which is said to have laid the foundations of modern  technical analysis , history repeats itself, and this is a situation where we forced to consider this. 

Should we break from the line, we will likely fall straight down to the $5000-$5000 area, where we will shoot back up and bounce towards around $6700 or so (maybe a little less). From there one, we will likely enter a sideways trend, which we will continue until we see higher highs and higher lows and parabolic movement returns, which could lead to us challenging the all-time high, and hitting $35k-$50k. 

NOTE: I seem to have reached the max character limit for this section of the idea, so I will continue my text below.

Comment:
					Onto the short-term: 


Scenario A: 

The reason why I have drawn this movement into a pennant is this way, is simply because we have been moving through this ascending triangle for quite a while now (May 23rd to today). I don't think that the pattern will be sufficient to directly lead into a strong sell-off, but we should consider that the size of ascending triangle suggests a small movement downwards at the very least, which can create a higher low, and thus move into position into a bearish pennant. Why would a bearish pennant occur here and not have a bounce to $8500-$8700? The reason is in positioning - the huge downtrend (May 5th to May 26th) creates a very nice flagpole in which it hits around the $5000 area very perfectly, and thus I would not be surprised if this happens. 

Second reason: on the Stoch RSI indicator on the daily chart, it appears to be dangerously high, which would suggest it being oversold. For the most part, it seems to have called lows and highs, at least to some extent. This overdrawn movement may very well have increased the likelyhood of Bitcoin being oversold. This could suggest that this is the last step into a sharp downturn, but this does not preclude Situation B. Volume has also been steadily decreasing, but this is the case with any sort of consolidation, I believe. 

Finally, the lines I have drawn below the triangle are simply bounces that I think seem fairly reasonable. The length from to support to the lines correlate with the length of the flagpole, of course, though it may seem chopped off due to the huge line from the long-term support downwards. 


Scenario B: 

This is much simpler, Bitcoin hits the upper resistance line, bounces off, challenges the lower support line, and we potentially see a break, and the rest unfolds from there. 


----------------------------------------------------------------------- 


With all this being said, do not fear if you are hoping for more parabolic movement - this likely will not be the end, and will simply be the set up for a long, drawn out sideways movement until the first signs of bullish activity begin and we start all over again. If you are longing around here, please consider using risk management, prepare for every possibility. If you are shorting, the same applies. 

Please trade with care. I wish the best to all traders!

Comment:
					This really is a very minor note, but I just want to emphasize that the rising wedge (which I erroneously refer to as an ascending triangle, a bad habit I have) entering a bearish pennant is more based on intuition than anything. Also, this pennant is mainly based on the conservative assumption that the break will happen at 7900, if it happens at 7700 where we seem to be general resistance, the pennant would look something like this:

Jun 7




I am Mid term-bullish on  BTC -1.51%  going into the end of this week, but looking to get into the market on a pull back to occur before I get in to the market.  The jury is still out as to whether this weekly bear trend is ready to turn around.  

We can see that both the  RSI  and  MFI  are both  Bullish  on the daily having bottomed when reaching oversold on both at c. $7k support where we found our longer term  trend line . 

We are currently in the process of meeting the Tenkan (blue line) as I write this, so in the very short term, I am looking for a pull back to $7550 range for an entry.  One of the main reasons for this is that on the 4hour timeframes we are close to completing an edge to edge trade so the risk reward doesn’t fit my profile, however a break out from the cloud or above the Tenkan around $7777 will make me enter the market. 

The  RSI  and  MFI  have both been excellent indicators in this bear market.  Whenever  RSI  has gone above the 60 and the  MFI  80; its time to exit the market from a  bullish  trade and consider shorting as it progresses higher.   

Based on the  RSI ,  MFI  trends and the fact that we will run into the Kijun at just around $8-8.2k, I will be scalling out at this  bearish  confluence level to start looking for pull backs and reassessment as i believe it to be a key point as  

Best case scenario this trade would yield a 10% return before leverage. 
This is for illustrative purposes only, please DYOR and goodluck with your trading.

So the pullback trade that we were looking at worked out & has made it's way back to the neckline level of structure. We are now at what i like to call a ""decision point"" Essentially IF price is able to violate this current level od structure THEN we're likely to continue to our next price projection.  

Something that a lot of newer traders don't understand is that when it comes to bigger moves, the market will often provide multiple opportunities to get involved. For those who don't rush and for those who don't get discouraged. If you perform consistent analysis you can often find multiple ways to involve yourself in a trade even if you missed the first strike.

Recent price action has clear signs of wash trading / market manipulation fud and lots of nonsense. Its hard to prove almost impossible so as a trader we just need to deal with it. Ideally the situation you are supposed to trade are critical break up and break down points to enter the trade. Dont enter or exit dumb trades and lose money.

I am never good with words so instead of writing paragraphs of clarification to justify my call for SHORT since my last posting, I have explained everything on my chart with the least words possible using Fibonacci. It does not matter how popular  Bitcoin -1.51%  has become, or how deep it has disrupted the financial sector, or how many institutional investors have come to invest in it -- the psychology behind a market cycle does not change. 

I don't really encourage anyone to short  Bitcoin -1.51% , but in all honesty, don't expect the bulls to fly anytime soon.

My best idea ever, taking some time off the last 2 days :) The whales just continue to play their little games by squeezing leveraged short and long positions out of the market. Can't play them, it's just too easy. Maybe it's time we retail traders stand together, combine our  volume  and use their own game against them. Yeah, maybe we could even make a blockbuster movie about this :) I love me some science fiction :) LOL  

My last update of the previous analysis i showed 2 important support levels where the price could bounce up from. The first support around 7350 did the trick and the price got pushed back to 7700. From that point on i told my members that i thought i was seeing distribution, but it was still very confusing to figure out what was going on. TA was showing  bullish  signs, that  bull flag  was very strong and was even turning slowly up and was about to squeeze upwards. But of course out of no where the price got dumped, the move we saw a few hours ago. After that 200 point drop the price got pushed up again to 7700 like that dump was a glitch. If your a whale, why not push out leveraged traders and take your money while your accumulating or distributing. It's like a bonus, like the cherry on top :)  

Anyway, in this chart we can see allot of similarities of what is going on. As you know i have been saying i am still  bearish  for the medium term, but i just could not say what was going to happen on the short term. 2 days ago after we finally dropped out of that  wedge , i said we would have 2 options.  
- Break those 2 support levels from the last update of my previous chart (73xx and 71xx) 
- Make a higher low at those same support levels and make another move up above the high.  
 
As we can see in the chart, the  fractal  is not 100% identical so it's no guarantee that the 7700 high we just saw is the high already and that we start to move down. But based on this  fractal , i don't want to see the price get above the 7800/7900. This  fractal  confirms my  bearish  view as well. That's why TA is so great, you can turn any chart to fit your view :). 

Even without this  fractal , i just give it a very small chance that 7K price action is the fundament of a low to start another bull rally, i just highly doubt that. I want to see more  volume  to begin with and at least  double bottom  kind of formation. So the minimum i expect is a test of the 7100/6900in the coming week or 2. But the movement i have in mind for the med term is a drop below the 7K to form a big V shape low. If we get to see that, than i might even become  bullish  for the rest of the year :).  

As long as the price stays above the 73xx, we have to assume the bulls are still in control and we should see another wave up. So for me the 73xx is an important turning point.

					This is my bigger picture, think this bearish triangle is still 100% in play. I think if bulls can't break the 7800/7900 the bearish version is probably going to happen. Can't say HOW it will go, this blue line is just a guess. But a big V shape low would be the most bullish for the long term. I still think we are seeing distribution here. The only way this idea can be countered, is through a big increase of buying volume, if that doesn't happen, i think it's only a matter of time.

					What a surprise, nothing has changed :) 

The price took a small dump but the volume was low so no real read on what the intent was. So we might see another move up, if we start to see a small pump that takes out the 7800, be aware of a fake breakout. The blue line is a possibility of what the move could look like IF we move up and if the breakout fails. If that happens than we will probably get confirmation if the price breaks the 7600ish. If we break the 7800 it should stay above the 7700 to confirm another move up. Not much more to say about what's going on.

					So we have made a small drop, but there is no volume confirming it, not yet at least. First small support has been broken, but not yet very meaningful because of the low volume. For the ones who shorted it, just be aware of another squeeze up, since this small move downwards looks a bit to controlled.  

Pure TA, it broke the channel and retested the former support as resistance now.

613,1528359434.0,Taiwan_Bear,2618 (Double top & 0.618 pull-back) - do not miss it!!,"
In the last couple of TAs I have mentioned the “2618 pattern” and have been asked what 2618 means. Sorry for taking it so long as it took me quite a while to put everything altogether. But, as promised, I have explained below the rules and trade setups for the 2618 pattern.  

What are the rules/setups/steps for 2618?  
1.	Form a  double top  (Note #1)  
2.	Neckline has to be broken  
3.	After price found support at point (b), wait for pull back to 0.618 fib retracement of (a)(b)  
4.	After price retraced to 0.618, look for confluence and sell (eg. Structures,  trendlines  ,  double top  on a lower time frame,  rsi  divergence,  bearish pin bar  ,  inside bar  break down etc.) (Note #2)  
5.	Stop loss to be set above  double top 
6.	Set Take Profit levels (Note #3)  

Note #1 ( Double top ):  
The first step for the formation of 2618 is to form a  double top  at key resistance levels. Why at key resistance levels? Because we want to avoid fake double tops which can occur occasionally.  

There are some variations between various resources (books, websites) regarding the definitions of “double top”. The main differences occur where:  
a)	Some said for a  double top  to be valid, the wick of the 2nd top cannot exceed the wick of the 1st top; whereas, others said:  
b)	The wick of the 2nd top can exceed the wick of the 1st top but the candle close of the 2nd top CANNOT exceed the wick of the 1st top; or  
c)	The wick of the 2nd top can exceed the wick of the 1st top and the candle close of the 2nd top CAN exceed the wick of the 1st top; or  
d)	The wick of the 2nd top meets at least the candle close of the 1st top; or  
e)	The body of the 2nd top cannot exceed the body of the 1st top  

Personally, I would say all the above definitions work just fine although I do prefer definition a) because it means that the selling pressure is strong and the bulls fail to make a higher high. When there is a higher high formed in a downtrend, it can mean the downtrend has reversed and therefore you might not want to sell when the price pulls back to the 0.618 fib retracement.  

Note #2 ( 0.618 retracement ):  
When the price pulls back to 0.618, it does not mean to sell straight away. There must be more than one reason to sell other than the 0.618 retrace. The more reasons the better. In this example, you can see there are certainly structures (key resistance levels) at the 0.618 retrace. As well, there was a  double top  formed on the lower time frame. Consequently, you can sell.  

After  BTC -1.51%  hit the 0.618 retrace the first time, the price dropped from $9735 to $8650. but quickly bounced back to the 0.618 retrace level. That was a second & better opportunity to sell. Not only did  BTC -1.51%  form a  double top  on the larger time frame, but also with a  bearish  divergence on the 4hr time frame. Accordingly, you have more reasons to sell.  

Note #3 (Set take profit)  
Same as the rules of “Double top”, there are some variations as to which price level should you take profits. Personally, I would stick to the below:  
1)	First, take profit when risk/reward ratio hits 1:1 (recommend to take 30% - 50% profits and adjust the SL of the remaining positions to break-even)  
2)	When price hits the same price level as the low after the neckline is broken ((b) point in this example)  
3)	When price hits 1.272 fib extension of (a)(b)  
4)	When price hits point (d) (using  AB=CD  pattern. If you are not sure what the rules of  AB=CD  are, you can refer to my previous TA in which I have attached the link below)  
5)	If in a one-way market (heavily bearish/bullish), you can always keep 10% to 20% of your positions and take profits when risk/reward ratio hits 1:5 or even 1:10

 BTC -1.51%  is on the verge of breaking to a daily higher high on the bounce if the bulls can see a push this morning. 
If we reject from here the daily will form a lower high and we will see a tightening pattern within the highlighted  support and resistance  lines.  
Important for the bulls to show up or we could stay in this range into tomorrow.  
Healthy consolidation after the most recent bull move and the 15 min chart needs to change the trend.  
Also look to  EMA  12 support on the 4 hour and hourly.  
Another morning like yesterday with the bulls comfortable as worst case, we likely stay in the tightening pattern if bulls cannot prove themselves.

The current situation of  Bitcoin -1.51%  is quite difficult. We are on a clear treshold. A lot of traders are saying that we are on a clear downtrend, but the same amount of people are claiming that we will have our reversal soon. 

This article tries to sum up all important information you have to need! 

1: Retracement of a parabolic uptrend: 
There is a rule of thumb for the retracement of a parabolic uptrend. We should retrace to approx. the 0.786  Fibonacci Retracement  +/- 10%! 
Depending where we start the count, we are already in that target. Although both ways (blue and red) have still some space for a further downwave! 







2: The bloody support of Bitcoin: 
The average cost of mining one  bitcoin -1.51%  are at USA/Russia approx. 4700$ and at 3100$ for china! 
A drop below a target of 4700$ would be savage. Nevertheless, i can't image that we will hit that target. 







3: Manipulation of  Bitcoin -1.51%  and the Bart Simpson Pattern: 
A friend of mine found some unusual patterns in the orderbooks of several exchanges: 
https://twitter.com/CryptoSyndrome 
Altcoins are manipulated on a daily basis. It seems that  bitcoin -1.51%  is now affected to this too, which causes all these 3-5% pump and dumps. 
Thus, we are forming all the time the Bartin Simpsons Patterns. 

4: Similarity to 2014: 
Bitcoin -1.51%  now: 






Bitcoin -1.51%  2014: 







5: Deminishing downtrend and a strong support 
If we see the falling  wedges  as the force of the downtrend, then the force is diminishing! 
Furthermore we have strong support which is holding now for the 4th time! 







6: The Indicators 
Having a look at the indicators at 2D, we have a good potential for an upwave now. 
The  volume  is deminishing which should indicate a breakout soon. 
The  MACD  is about to cross, the  RSI  was slightly overbought and is heading up like the  Stoch .  RSI . 
The 200  EMA  is slighty under the current price and act as a support. 

7: The symetrical Triangle 
The theory says, that we should have in a  sym -1.72% . triangle 5 times an  ABC  wave. The waves are not perfect, but we can construct them. 






As you can see, the last four ABC-Waves formed always a 1:1 extention, which indicates that we have finished wave 5. 

8: A possible Head and Shoulders 
Even if this is not the most perfect  Head and Shoulders  Pattern, it's still valid! 
We are currently at the neckline, which is a strong and important resistance. Breaking upwards should indicate a good uptrend. 







9: The magic  6th 0.00%  of the month 






Suprisingly we have on every  6th 0.00%  of the month a reversal. Why is that??? 
One reason could be the  CME Group Futures  with dates for the settlements always nearby the  6th 0.00%  of the month! 
http://www.cmegroup.com 

10: Longterm  Bullish  TA 
The whole pattern could be seen as a big  bullish pennant . 







11: Shortterm  Bullish  TA 
Leading diagonal  starting wave1 of an  Elliott Wave , since we have now an impulse wave, after the 5x  ABC  pattern inside the triangle is finished. 
Our target should be at the top of the triangle nearby 8600-8800$. 







12: Longterm  Bearish  TA 
We also can argue, that we are currenty in an downtrend and the  sym -1.72% . triangle just continuing the trend. 
Our target should be nearby 6000$ which is also a finished downwards  Elliott Wave .

Nothing is happening in the market:  volatility  has become extinct and coins' trading fallen out of fashion. Range-bound bots and robotic humans absolutely prosper in this environment. The price was unable to break the 7700 threshold. For me this is a  bearish  signal. Indicators provide mixed signals, so let's examine wave structure. The move from May 29 is a  3-wave -0.12%  correction within a larger downtrend. A price drop below 7500 would confirm this scenario.

					Impulse Wave Truncation (Truncated Fifth) - 
Truncated 5th wave is when the market has become so over-extended in Wave 3 that there is not much force left for the impulse wave to come to a proper completion. So when this happens, there is a chance that the last wave of the impulse, Wave 5, will not reach the end of Wave 3 before the market starts correcting in the opposite direction. At this point, the market is just too exhausted. This condition is often called a “failure” or a “Truncation.”

I can see many people still believe that we are going inside a  descending triangle . I also believed this in my idea that i shard on may 1st: 



 

Things can change so quickly and if we didn't adapt to the changes then someone will. That's why i believe that we have to be in fast adapt mode in this market. Doesn't mean that you need to change without checking yourself. I try to find 2-3 confirmations before i change my idea on something. This includes pattern changes, trend changes etc 

There are 21 corrective wave patterns in EW which is categorized into major 3 corrective wave patterns: 

Zigzag  (5-3-5) 
Flat (3-3-5) 
Triangle (3-3-3-3-3) 

And other patterns are combinations of the above which is:  

Double three (A combination of two corrective patterns above) 
Triple three (A combination of three corrective patterns above) 

So what i can see now is that we are in two double three combination corrective wave pattern: 








More info here:  

https://elliottwave-forecast.com/elliott-wave-theory/#corrective-waves 

Confirmations: 

1. Wave ((i)) of C is 1.6k and ((v)) is going to be completed below the triangle 
2. Wave (E) of the triangle can't go beyond the triangle.  
3. This has happened twice before in 2013 & 2015 

Each wave  got 3 subwaves (a,b &c) inside and we are in the subwave c of ((y)) of Y which is an impulsive wave. 

Impulsive waves: 1,3,5,a,c 
Corrective waves: 2,4,b 

Normal Fibo Ratios for these waves are: 

wave 2 = 0.5 - 0.8 of wave 1  
wave 3 = 1.236 - 1.618 of wave 1  
wave 4 = 0.5 - 0.618 of wave 3  
wave 5 = 0.618 - 1 of wave 1  
wave B = 0.5 - 0.8 of wave A  
wave C = 0.618 - 1.236 of wave A  

Now if you check what happened in subwave a of ((y)) of Y you can see that: 

Wave (i) of a: 985$ 
Wave (ii) of a: 434$  
Wave ( iii -0.45% ) of a: 1207$  
Wave (iv) of a: 691$ [~0.618 of Wave ( iii -0.45% )] 
Wave (v) of a: 950$  








I have seen  BTC -1.49%  impulsive waves fibo ratios almost the same as the previous impulsive wave fibo ratios. 
Now if you apply the same for the last wave C of (E) this is what you get: 

Wave ((i)) of c: 1587$ 
Wave ((ii)) of c  = 793$ 
Wave (( iii -0.45% )) of c  = 1961$ 
Wave ((iv)) of c [~0.618 of Wave (( iii -0.45% ))] = 1212$ 
Wave ((v)) of c  = 1587$ 








Also note that Wave ((iv)) might not retrace upto 0.618 of Wave (( iii -0.45% )) as everyone will be in panic mode by that time so minimum retracement would be around 0.386 of Wave (( iii -0.45% )) which is around 756$ and this is why i can see it goes down to 5k level or little bit more towards 4.7k which is the lowest level of the  support zone  (orange dotted lines) 








So 3 Possible Support lines for reversal would be 

1. Blue: 5800 - 6100 (Only possible if Wave ((v)) is truncated) 
2. Orange: 4700 - 5000 (This is most likely where we heading)  
3. Red: 4100 - 4400 (Only possible if Wave (( iii -0.45% )) is extended)

 Bitcoin -1.45%  has recently developed an interesting pattern of completing a  bullish  and  bearish  cycle on the sixth of every month in an alternating order. As we can see in the chart above, a fall is followed by a rise. This has happened twice before and is expected to happen again now on the  6th 0.00%  of June, 2018. This time  Bitcoin -1.45%  will finish a  bearish  cycle and I expected to begin the next  bullish  cycle at least till the end of  6th 0.00%  of July, 2018. 

This pattern of rise and fall is also supported by other patterns on the chart that signal a  bullish  reversal. The support line has also held firmly and if this pattern of alternating rise and fall ensues,  Bitcoin -1.45%  could very well make new highs by the end of the year. The  RSI  is recovering from oversold levels and has now approached a normal.  Bitcoin -1.45%  is currently at a favorable point for  bullish  entries. The price broke a long term resistance as it break past the downtrend line in April, 2018. This was a big accomplishment for the bulls but the lack of confidence pulled the price back to the support line. Currently, the price is just above the support line and appears to be all set for a  bullish  comeback but the reality is, there are not enough bulls in the market. 

The past few months have been devastating for the price of  Bitcoin -1.45%  ( BTC -1.45% ) and a lot of investors are still running scared. Institutional investors are looking for more clarity regarding regulations concerning cryptocurrencies and also safer ways to invest and store their coins. As for retail investors, most of them comprise of first time investors who have never traded any financial asset before. So, when they saw that  Bitcoin -1.45%  ( BTC -1.45% ) is making 20% gains every day, they thought this could go on forever and jumped with both feet, only to find the carpet pulled under from their feet. Big investors have always played small investors as cannon fodder and have gotten away with their schemes even in regulated markets like forex or the stock market. Cryptocurrencies is a new market with no proper regulations which means it is natural to expect that those who can afford to not play by the rules, most likely won’t.

Hello friends,  

It's been a while since my last post; lack of time and an urge to do more research has mainly driven me to take a break from posting ideas on TradingView. I am still in the process of doing more research and study, but I figure posting once in a while couldn't hurt. 

Since I have become recently very convinced about this, I am outlining a very possible situation with  Bitcoin -1.45%  where the  trend line  we have been on since early October breaks, reaching around a temporary low of $5000. This is examined on the  daily chart , since this is one of the best charts to examine trends of this size. I have to first and foremost say that I am not trying to spread fear, I know many people do not like to hear  bearish  ideas, but  technical analysis  is ultimately a rational exercise, and I feel that possibilities with very strong signs should be explored. 

There are a few things to look at, but I first want to talk about the big picture with, long-term  support and resistance  lines. I think most people can agree that there was a very significant downtrending resistance line that began from the peak of the  ATH 0.63%  in late December, to the low of around $6400 (thick red line). After the break from that line, it seems we moved into a sideways trend, bouncing back and forth between an emerging downtrending resistance line (light red) and a support line that we seem to have been respecting since mid-October (light green); at least this appears to be the case with the lows, where the angle's effectiveness appears very strongly. Finally, based on previous bounces, we can establish a support of around $5000-$5300 (I've thus created a small  support zone  around that range, in dark green), as well as lower supports around $3200 and $2000 (though I do not believe these will be reached, in dark green).   

Now, onto the analysis - it's no secret that  Bitcoin -1.45%  has been squeezing in, ready for a significant move either upwards or downwards. Initially I considered the upwards move to be more likely due to the significant media attention cryptocurrency has been receiving, but after viewing previous market cycles of  Bitcoin -1.45%  (check 2013), it seems clear to me that the  bearish  scenario of closing in on the market cycle is very likely, and should at the very least be prepared for with proper risk management. According to Dow Theory, which is said to have laid the foundations of modern  technical analysis , history repeats itself, and this is a situation where we forced to consider this. 

Should we break from the line, we will likely fall straight down to the $5000-$5000 area, where we will shoot back up and bounce towards around $6700 or so (maybe a little less). From there one, we will likely enter a sideways trend, which we will continue until we see higher highs and higher lows and parabolic movement returns, which could lead to us challenging the all-time high, and hitting $35k-$50k. 

NOTE: I seem to have reached the max character limit for this section of the idea, so I will continue my text below.

Comment:
					Onto the short-term: 


Scenario A: 

The reason why I have drawn this movement into a pennant is this way, is simply because we have been moving through this ascending triangle for quite a while now (May 23rd to today). I don't think that the pattern will be sufficient to directly lead into a strong sell-off, but we should consider that the size of ascending triangle suggests a small movement downwards at the very least, which can create a higher low, and thus move into position into a bearish pennant. Why would a bearish pennant occur here and not have a bounce to $8500-$8700? The reason is in positioning - the huge downtrend (May 5th to May 26th) creates a very nice flagpole in which it hits around the $5000 area very perfectly, and thus I would not be surprised if this happens. 

Second reason: on the Stoch RSI indicator on the daily chart, it appears to be dangerously high, which would suggest it being oversold. For the most part, it seems to have called lows and highs, at least to some extent. This overdrawn movement may very well have increased the likelyhood of Bitcoin being oversold. This could suggest that this is the last step into a sharp downturn, but this does not preclude Situation B. Volume has also been steadily decreasing, but this is the case with any sort of consolidation, I believe. 

Finally, the lines I have drawn below the triangle are simply bounces that I think seem fairly reasonable. The length from to support to the lines correlate with the length of the flagpole, of course, though it may seem chopped off due to the huge line from the long-term support downwards. 


Scenario B: 

This is much simpler, Bitcoin hits the upper resistance line, bounces off, challenges the lower support line, and we potentially see a break, and the rest unfolds from there. 


----------------------------------------------------------------------- 


With all this being said, do not fear if you are hoping for more parabolic movement - this likely will not be the end, and will simply be the set up for a long, drawn out sideways movement until the first signs of bullish activity begin and we start all over again. If you are longing around here, please consider using risk management, prepare for every possibility. If you are shorting, the same applies. 

Please trade with care. I wish the best to all traders!

Comment:
					This really is a very minor note, but I just want to emphasize that the rising wedge (which I erroneously refer to as an ascending triangle, a bad habit I have) entering a bearish pennant is more based on intuition than anything. Also, this pennant is mainly based on the conservative assumption that the break will happen at 7900, if it happens at 7700 where we seem to be general resistance, the pennant would look something like this:

Jun 7




I am Mid term-bullish on  BTC -1.45%  going into the end of this week, but looking to get into the market on a pull back to occur before I get in to the market.  The jury is still out as to whether this weekly bear trend is ready to turn around.  

We can see that both the  RSI  and  MFI  are both  Bullish  on the daily having bottomed when reaching oversold on both at c. $7k support where we found our longer term  trend line . 

We are currently in the process of meeting the Tenkan (blue line) as I write this, so in the very short term, I am looking for a pull back to $7550 range for an entry.  One of the main reasons for this is that on the 4hour timeframes we are close to completing an edge to edge trade so the risk reward doesn’t fit my profile, however a break out from the cloud or above the Tenkan around $7777 will make me enter the market. 

The  RSI  and  MFI  have both been excellent indicators in this bear market.  Whenever  RSI  has gone above the 60 and the  MFI  80; its time to exit the market from a  bullish  trade and consider shorting as it progresses higher.   

Based on the  RSI ,  MFI  trends and the fact that we will run into the Kijun at just around $8-8.2k, I will be scalling out at this  bearish  confluence level to start looking for pull backs and reassessment as i believe it to be a key point as  

Best case scenario this trade would yield a 10% return before leverage. 
This is for illustrative purposes only, please DYOR and goodluck with your trading.

So the pullback trade that we were looking at worked out & has made it's way back to the neckline level of structure. We are now at what i like to call a ""decision point"" Essentially IF price is able to violate this current level od structure THEN we're likely to continue to our next price projection.  

Something that a lot of newer traders don't understand is that when it comes to bigger moves, the market will often provide multiple opportunities to get involved. For those who don't rush and for those who don't get discouraged. If you perform consistent analysis you can often find multiple ways to involve yourself in a trade even if you missed the first strike.

Recent price action has clear signs of wash trading / market manipulation fud and lots of nonsense. Its hard to prove almost impossible so as a trader we just need to deal with it.

My best idea ever, taking some time off the last 2 days :) The whales just continue to play their little games by squeezing leveraged short and long positions out of the market. Can't play them, it's just too easy. Maybe it's time we retail traders stand together, combine our  volume  and use their own game against them. Yeah, maybe we could even make a blockbuster movie about this :) I love me some science fiction :) LOL  

My last update of the previous analysis i showed 2 important support levels where the price could bounce up from. The first support around 7350 did the trick and the price got pushed back to 7700. From that point on i told my members that i thought i was seeing distribution, but it was still very confusing to figure out what was going on. TA was showing  bullish  signs, that  bull flag  was very strong and was even turning slowly up and was about to squeeze upwards. But of course out of no where the price got dumped, the move we saw a few hours ago. After that 200 point drop the price got pushed up again to 7700 like that dump was a glitch. If your a whale, why not push out leveraged traders and take your money while your accumulating or distributing. It's like a bonus, like the cherry on top :)  

Anyway, in this chart we can see allot of similarities of what is going on. As you know i have been saying i am still  bearish  for the medium term, but i just could not say what was going to happen on the short term. 2 days ago after we finally dropped out of that  wedge , i said we would have 2 options.  
- Break those 2 support levels from the last update of my previous chart (73xx and 71xx) 
- Make a higher low at those same support levels and make another move up above the high.  
 
As we can see in the chart, the  fractal  is not 100% identical so it's no guarantee that the 7700 high we just saw is the high already and that we start to move down. But based on this  fractal , i don't want to see the price get above the 7800/7900. This  fractal  confirms my  bearish  view as well. That's why TA is so great, you can turn any chart to fit your view :). 

Even without this  fractal , i just give it a very small chance that 7K price action is the fundament of a low to start another bull rally, i just highly doubt that. I want to see more  volume  to begin with and at least  double bottom  kind of formation. So the minimum i expect is a test of the 7100/6900in the coming week or 2. But the movement i have in mind for the med term is a drop below the 7K to form a big V shape low. If we get to see that, than i might even become  bullish  for the rest of the year :).  

As long as the price stays above the 73xx, we have to assume the bulls are still in control and we should see another wave up. So for me the 73xx is an important turning point.

Comment:
					At the moment it looks like bulls are trying to push higher, this bull flag/triangle is still very strong. So no sign of weakness yet! First small sign would be a drop below 7620/7600. Bulls need to break 7700

Comment:
					This is my bigger picture, think this bearish triangle is still 100% in play. I think if bulls can't break the 7800/7900 the bearish version is probably going to happen. Can't say HOW it will go, this blue line is just a guess. But a big V shape low would be the most bullish for the long term. I still think we are seeing distribution here. The only way this idea can be countered, is through a big increase of buying volume, if that doesn't happen, i think it's only a matter of time.

Comment:
					Lower time frame we can see a new upwards channel and maybe even a rising wedge. From the looks of it, it's slowly going down to test the support line again. Depending on what will happen there we can make a better prediction for the rest of the day.

Comment:
					What a surprise, nothing has changed :) 

The price took a small dump but the volume was low so no real read on what the intent was. So we might see another move up, if we start to see a small pump that takes out the 7800, be aware of a fake breakout. The blue line is a possibility of what the move could look like IF we move up and if the breakout fails. If that happens than we will probably get confirmation if the price breaks the 7600ish. If we break the 7800 it should stay above the 7700 to confirm another move up. Not much more to say about what's going on.

Comment:
					So we have made a small drop, but there is no volume confirming it, not yet at least. First small support has been broken, but not yet very meaningful because of the low volume. For the ones who shorted it, just be aware of another squeeze up, since this small move downwards looks a bit to controlled.  

Pure TA, it broke the channel and retested the former support as resistance now.

631,1528359434.0,Taiwan_Bear,2618 (Double top & 0.618 pull-back) - do not miss it!!,"
In the last couple of TAs I have mentioned the “2618 pattern” and have been asked what 2618 means. Sorry for taking it so long as it took me quite a while to put everything altogether. But, as promised, I have explained below the rules and trade setups for the 2618 pattern.  

What are the rules/setups/steps for 2618?  
1.	Form a  double top  (Note #1)  
2.	Neckline has to be broken  
3.	After price found support at point (b), wait for pull back to 0.618 fib retracement of (a)(b)  
4.	After price retraced to 0.618, look for confluence and sell (eg. Structures,  trendlines  ,  double top  on a lower time frame,  rsi  divergence,  bearish pin bar  ,  inside bar  break down etc.) (Note #2)  
5.	Stop loss to be set above  double top 
6.	Set Take Profit levels (Note #3)  

Note #1 ( Double top ):  
The first step for the formation of 2618 is to form a  double top  at key resistance levels. Why at key resistance levels? Because we want to avoid fake double tops which can occur occasionally.  

There are some variations between various resources (books, websites) regarding the definitions of “double top”. The main differences occur where:  
a)	Some said for a  double top  to be valid, the wick of the 2nd top cannot exceed the wick of the 1st top; whereas, others said:  
b)	The wick of the 2nd top can exceed the wick of the 1st top but the candle close of the 2nd top CANNOT exceed the wick of the 1st top; or  
c)	The wick of the 2nd top can exceed the wick of the 1st top and the candle close of the 2nd top CAN exceed the wick of the 1st top; or  
d)	The wick of the 2nd top meets at least the candle close of the 1st top; or  
e)	The body of the 2nd top cannot exceed the body of the 1st top  

Personally, I would say all the above definitions work just fine although I do prefer definition a) because it means that the selling pressure is strong and the bulls fail to make a higher high. When there is a higher high formed in a downtrend, it can mean the downtrend has reversed and therefore you might not want to sell when the price pulls back to the 0.618 fib retracement.  

Note #2 ( 0.618 retracement ):  
When the price pulls back to 0.618, it does not mean to sell straight away. There must be more than one reason to sell other than the 0.618 retrace. The more reasons the better. In this example, you can see there are certainly structures (key resistance levels) at the 0.618 retrace. As well, there was a  double top  formed on the lower time frame. Consequently, you can sell.  

After  BTC -1.48%  hit the 0.618 retrace the first time, the price dropped from $9735 to $8650. but quickly bounced back to the 0.618 retrace level. That was a second & better opportunity to sell. Not only did  BTC -1.48%  form a  double top  on the larger time frame, but also with a  bearish  divergence on the 4hr time frame. Accordingly, you have more reasons to sell.  

Note #3 (Set take profit)  
Same as the rules of “Double top”, there are some variations as to which price level should you take profits. Personally, I would stick to the below:  
1)	First, take profit when risk/reward ratio hits 1:1 (recommend to take 30% - 50% profits and adjust the SL of the remaining positions to break-even)  
2)	When price hits the same price level as the low after the neckline is broken ((b) point in this example)  
3)	When price hits 1.272 fib extension of (a)(b)  
4)	When price hits point (d) (using  AB=CD  pattern. If you are not sure what the rules of  AB=CD  are, you can refer to my previous TA in which I have attached the link below)  
5)	If in a one-way market (heavily bearish/bullish), you can always keep 10% to 20% of your positions and take profits when risk/reward ratio hits 1:5 or even 1:10

 BTC -1.48%  is on the verge of breaking to a daily higher high on the bounce if the bulls can see a push this morning. 
If we reject from here the daily will form a lower high and we will see a tightening pattern within the highlighted  support and resistance  lines.  
Important for the bulls to show up or we could stay in this range into tomorrow.  
Healthy consolidation after the most recent bull move and the 15 min chart needs to change the trend.  
Also look to  EMA  12 support on the 4 hour and hourly.  
Another morning like yesterday with the bulls comfortable as worst case, we likely stay in the tightening pattern if bulls cannot prove themselves.

The current situation of  Bitcoin -1.45%  is quite difficult. We are on a clear treshold. A lot of traders are saying that we are on a clear downtrend, but the same amount of people are claiming that we will have our reversal soon. 

This article tries to sum up all important information you have to need! 

1: Retracement of a parabolic uptrend: 
There is a rule of thumb for the retracement of a parabolic uptrend. We should retrace to approx. the 0.786  Fibonacci Retracement  +/- 10%! 
Depending where we start the count, we are already in that target. Although both ways (blue and red) have still some space for a further downwave! 







2: The bloody support of Bitcoin: 
The average cost of mining one  bitcoin -1.45%  are at USA/Russia approx. 4700$ and at 3100$ for china! 
A drop below a target of 4700$ would be savage. Nevertheless, i can't image that we will hit that target. 







3: Manipulation of  Bitcoin -1.45%  and the Bart Simpson Pattern: 
A friend of mine found some unusual patterns in the orderbooks of several exchanges: 
https://twitter.com/CryptoSyndrome 
Altcoins are manipulated on a daily basis. It seems that  bitcoin -1.45%  is now affected to this too, which causes all these 3-5% pump and dumps. 
Thus, we are forming all the time the Bartin Simpsons Patterns. 

4: Similarity to 2014: 
Bitcoin -1.45%  now: 






Bitcoin -1.45%  2014: 







5: Deminishing downtrend and a strong support 
If we see the falling  wedges  as the force of the downtrend, then the force is diminishing! 
Furthermore we have strong support which is holding now for the 4th time! 







6: The Indicators 
Having a look at the indicators at 2D, we have a good potential for an upwave now. 
The  volume  is deminishing which should indicate a breakout soon. 
The  MACD  is about to cross, the  RSI  was slightly overbought and is heading up like the  Stoch .  RSI . 
The 200  EMA  is slighty under the current price and act as a support. 

7: The symetrical Triangle 
The theory says, that we should have in a  sym -1.72% . triangle 5 times an  ABC  wave. The waves are not perfect, but we can construct them. 






As you can see, the last four ABC-Waves formed always a 1:1 extention, which indicates that we have finished wave 5. 

8: A possible Head and Shoulders 
Even if this is not the most perfect  Head and Shoulders  Pattern, it's still valid! 
We are currently at the neckline, which is a strong and important resistance. Breaking upwards should indicate a good uptrend. 







9: The magic  6th 0.00%  of the month 






Suprisingly we have on every  6th 0.00%  of the month a reversal. Why is that??? 
One reason could be the  CME Group Futures  with dates for the settlements always nearby the  6th 0.00%  of the month! 
http://www.cmegroup.com 

10: Longterm  Bullish  TA 
The whole pattern could be seen as a big  bullish pennant . 







11: Shortterm  Bullish  TA 
Leading diagonal  starting wave1 of an  Elliott Wave , since we have now an impulse wave, after the 5x  ABC  pattern inside the triangle is finished. 
Our target should be at the top of the triangle nearby 8600-8800$. 







12: Longterm  Bearish  TA 
We also can argue, that we are currenty in an downtrend and the  sym -1.72% . triangle just continuing the trend. 
Our target should be nearby 6000$ which is also a finished downwards  Elliott Wave .

Nothing is happening in the market:  volatility  has become extinct and coins' trading fallen out of fashion. Range-bound bots and robotic humans absolutely prosper in this environment. The price was unable to break the 7700 threshold. For me this is a  bearish  signal. Indicators provide mixed signals, so let's examine wave structure. The move from May 29 is a  3-wave -0.12%  correction within a larger downtrend. A price drop below 7500 would confirm this scenario.

Comment:
					Impulse Wave Truncation (Truncated Fifth) - 
Truncated 5th wave is when the market has become so over-extended in Wave 3 that there is not much force left for the impulse wave to come to a proper completion. So when this happens, there is a chance that the last wave of the impulse, Wave 5, will not reach the end of Wave 3 before the market starts correcting in the opposite direction. At this point, the market is just too exhausted. This condition is often called a “failure” or a “Truncation.”

I can see many people still believe that we are going inside a  descending triangle . I also believed this in my idea that i shard on may 1st: 



 

Things can change so quickly and if we didn't adapt to the changes then someone will. That's why i believe that we have to be in fast adapt mode in this market. Doesn't mean that you need to change without checking yourself. I try to find 2-3 confirmations before i change my idea on something. This includes pattern changes, trend changes etc 

There are 21 corrective wave patterns in EW which is categorized into major 3 corrective wave patterns: 

Zigzag  (5-3-5) 
Flat (3-3-5) 
Triangle (3-3-3-3-3) 

And other patterns are combinations of the above which is:  

Double three (A combination of two corrective patterns above) 
Triple three (A combination of three corrective patterns above) 

So what i can see now is that we are in two double three combination corrective wave pattern: 








More info here:  

https://elliottwave-forecast.com/elliott-wave-theory/#corrective-waves 

Confirmations: 

1. Wave ((i)) of C is 1.6k and ((v)) is going to be completed below the triangle 
2. Wave (E) of the triangle can't go beyond the triangle.  
3. This has happened twice before in 2013 & 2015 

Each wave  got 3 subwaves (a,b &c) inside and we are in the subwave c of ((y)) of Y which is an impulsive wave. 

Impulsive waves: 1,3,5,a,c 
Corrective waves: 2,4,b 

Normal Fibo Ratios for these waves are: 

wave 2 = 0.5 - 0.8 of wave 1  
wave 3 = 1.236 - 1.618 of wave 1  
wave 4 = 0.5 - 0.618 of wave 3  
wave 5 = 0.618 - 1 of wave 1  
wave B = 0.5 - 0.8 of wave A  
wave C = 0.618 - 1.236 of wave A  

Now if you check what happened in subwave a of ((y)) of Y you can see that: 

Wave (i) of a: 985$ 
Wave (ii) of a: 434$  
Wave ( iii -0.44% ) of a: 1207$  
Wave (iv) of a: 691$ [~0.618 of Wave ( iii -0.44% )] 
Wave (v) of a: 950$  








I have seen  BTC -1.45%  impulsive waves fibo ratios almost the same as the previous impulsive wave fibo ratios. 
Now if you apply the same for the last wave C of (E) this is what you get: 

Wave ((i)) of c: 1587$ 
Wave ((ii)) of c  = 793$ 
Wave (( iii -0.44% )) of c  = 1961$ 
Wave ((iv)) of c [~0.618 of Wave (( iii -0.44% ))] = 1212$ 
Wave ((v)) of c  = 1587$ 








Also note that Wave ((iv)) might not retrace upto 0.618 of Wave (( iii -0.44% )) as everyone will be in panic mode by that time so minimum retracement would be around 0.386 of Wave (( iii -0.44% )) which is around 756$ and this is why i can see it goes down to 5k level or little bit more towards 4.7k which is the lowest level of the  support zone  (orange dotted lines) 








So 3 Possible Support lines for reversal would be 

1. Blue: 5800 - 6100 (Only possible if Wave ((v)) is truncated) 
2. Orange: 4700 - 5000 (This is most likely where we heading)  
3. Red: 4100 - 4400 (Only possible if Wave (( iii -0.44% )) is extended)

 Bitcoin -1.45%  has recently developed an interesting pattern of completing a  bullish  and  bearish  cycle on the sixth of every month in an alternating order. As we can see in the chart above, a fall is followed by a rise. This has happened twice before and is expected to happen again now on the  6th 0.00%  of June, 2018. This time  Bitcoin -1.45%  will finish a  bearish  cycle and I expected to begin the next  bullish  cycle at least till the end of  6th 0.00%  of July, 2018. 

This pattern of rise and fall is also supported by other patterns on the chart that signal a  bullish  reversal. The support line has also held firmly and if this pattern of alternating rise and fall ensues,  Bitcoin -1.45%  could very well make new highs by the end of the year. The  RSI  is recovering from oversold levels and has now approached a normal.  Bitcoin -1.45%  is currently at a favorable point for  bullish  entries. The price broke a long term resistance as it break past the downtrend line in April, 2018. This was a big accomplishment for the bulls but the lack of confidence pulled the price back to the support line. Currently, the price is just above the support line and appears to be all set for a  bullish  comeback but the reality is, there are not enough bulls in the market. 

The past few months have been devastating for the price of  Bitcoin -1.45%  ( BTC -1.45% ) and a lot of investors are still running scared. Institutional investors are looking for more clarity regarding regulations concerning cryptocurrencies and also safer ways to invest and store their coins. As for retail investors, most of them comprise of first time investors who have never traded any financial asset before. So, when they saw that  Bitcoin -1.45%  ( BTC -1.45% ) is making 20% gains every day, they thought this could go on forever and jumped with both feet, only to find the carpet pulled under from their feet. Big investors have always played small investors as cannon fodder and have gotten away with their schemes even in regulated markets like forex or the stock market. Cryptocurrencies is a new market with no proper regulations which means it is natural to expect that those who can afford to not play by the rules, most likely won’t.

Hello friends,  

It's been a while since my last post; lack of time and an urge to do more research has mainly driven me to take a break from posting ideas on TradingView. I am still in the process of doing more research and study, but I figure posting once in a while couldn't hurt. 

Since I have become recently very convinced about this, I am outlining a very possible situation with  Bitcoin -1.45%  where the  trend line  we have been on since early October breaks, reaching around a temporary low of $5000. This is examined on the  daily chart , since this is one of the best charts to examine trends of this size. I have to first and foremost say that I am not trying to spread fear, I know many people do not like to hear  bearish  ideas, but  technical analysis  is ultimately a rational exercise, and I feel that possibilities with very strong signs should be explored. 

There are a few things to look at, but I first want to talk about the big picture with, long-term  support and resistance  lines. I think most people can agree that there was a very significant downtrending resistance line that began from the peak of the  ATH 0.63%  in late December, to the low of around $6400 (thick red line). After the break from that line, it seems we moved into a sideways trend, bouncing back and forth between an emerging downtrending resistance line (light red) and a support line that we seem to have been respecting since mid-October (light green); at least this appears to be the case with the lows, where the angle's effectiveness appears very strongly. Finally, based on previous bounces, we can establish a support of around $5000-$5300 (I've thus created a small  support zone  around that range, in dark green), as well as lower supports around $3200 and $2000 (though I do not believe these will be reached, in dark green).   

Now, onto the analysis - it's no secret that  Bitcoin -1.45%  has been squeezing in, ready for a significant move either upwards or downwards. Initially I considered the upwards move to be more likely due to the significant media attention cryptocurrency has been receiving, but after viewing previous market cycles of  Bitcoin -1.45%  (check 2013), it seems clear to me that the  bearish  scenario of closing in on the market cycle is very likely, and should at the very least be prepared for with proper risk management. According to Dow Theory, which is said to have laid the foundations of modern  technical analysis , history repeats itself, and this is a situation where we forced to consider this. 

Should we break from the line, we will likely fall straight down to the $5000-$5000 area, where we will shoot back up and bounce towards around $6700 or so (maybe a little less). From there one, we will likely enter a sideways trend, which we will continue until we see higher highs and higher lows and parabolic movement returns, which could lead to us challenging the all-time high, and hitting $35k-$50k. 

NOTE: I seem to have reached the max character limit for this section of the idea, so I will continue my text below.

Comment:
					Onto the short-term: 


Scenario A: 

The reason why I have drawn this movement into a pennant is this way, is simply because we have been moving through this ascending triangle for quite a while now (May 23rd to today). I don't think that the pattern will be sufficient to directly lead into a strong sell-off, but we should consider that the size of ascending triangle suggests a small movement downwards at the very least, which can create a higher low, and thus move into position into a bearish pennant. Why would a bearish pennant occur here and not have a bounce to $8500-$8700? The reason is in positioning - the huge downtrend (May 5th to May 26th) creates a very nice flagpole in which it hits around the $5000 area very perfectly, and thus I would not be surprised if this happens. 

Second reason: on the Stoch RSI indicator on the daily chart, it appears to be dangerously high, which would suggest it being oversold. For the most part, it seems to have called lows and highs, at least to some extent. This overdrawn movement may very well have increased the likelyhood of Bitcoin being oversold. This could suggest that this is the last step into a sharp downturn, but this does not preclude Situation B. Volume has also been steadily decreasing, but this is the case with any sort of consolidation, I believe. 

Finally, the lines I have drawn below the triangle are simply bounces that I think seem fairly reasonable. The length from to support to the lines correlate with the length of the flagpole, of course, though it may seem chopped off due to the huge line from the long-term support downwards. 


Scenario B: 

This is much simpler, Bitcoin hits the upper resistance line, bounces off, challenges the lower support line, and we potentially see a break, and the rest unfolds from there. 


----------------------------------------------------------------------- 


With all this being said, do not fear if you are hoping for more parabolic movement - this likely will not be the end, and will simply be the set up for a long, drawn out sideways movement until the first signs of bullish activity begin and we start all over again. If you are longing around here, please consider using risk management, prepare for every possibility. If you are shorting, the same applies. 

Please trade with care. I wish the best to all traders!

Comment:
					This really is a very minor note, but I just want to emphasize that the rising wedge (which I erroneously refer to as an ascending triangle, a bad habit I have) entering a bearish pennant is more based on intuition than anything. Also, this pennant is mainly based on the conservative assumption that the break will happen at 7900, if it happens at 7700 where we seem to be general resistance, the pennant would look something like this:

I am Mid term-bullish on  BTC -1.45%  going into the end of this week, but looking to get into the market on a pull back to occur before I get in to the market.  The jury is still out as to whether this weekly bear trend is ready to turn around.  

We can see that both the  RSI  and  MFI  are both  Bullish  on the daily having bottomed when reaching oversold on both at c. $7k support where we found our longer term  trend line . 

We are currently in the process of meeting the Tenkan (blue line) as I write this, so in the very short term, I am looking for a pull back to $7550 range for an entry.  One of the main reasons for this is that on the 4hour timeframes we are close to completing an edge to edge trade so the risk reward doesn’t fit my profile, however a break out from the cloud or above the Tenkan around $7777 will make me enter the market. 

The  RSI  and  MFI  have both been excellent indicators in this bear market.  Whenever  RSI  has gone above the 60 and the  MFI  80; its time to exit the market from a  bullish  trade and consider shorting as it progresses higher.   

Based on the  RSI ,  MFI  trends and the fact that we will run into the Kijun at just around $8-8.2k, I will be scalling out at this  bearish  confluence level to start looking for pull backs and reassessment as i believe it to be a key point as  

Best case scenario this trade would yield a 10% return before leverage. 
This is for illustrative purposes only, please DYOR and goodluck with your trading.

So the pullback trade that we were looking at worked out & has made it's way back to the neckline level of structure. We are now at what i like to call a ""decision point"" Essentially IF price is able to violate this current level od structure THEN we're likely to continue to our next price projection.  

Something that a lot of newer traders don't understand is that when it comes to bigger moves, the market will often provide multiple opportunities to get involved. For those who don't rush and for those who don't get discouraged. If you perform consistent analysis you can often find multiple ways to involve yourself in a trade even if you missed the first strike.

I am not calculating the time I'm just making a technical drawing of the directions that we will see in the next few months.  

Recent price action has clear signs of wash trading / market manipulation fud and lots of nonsense. Its hard to prove almost impossible so as a trader we just need to deal with it. Ideally the situation you are supposed to trade are critical break up and break down points to enter the trade. Dont enter or exit dumb trades and lose money. As an experienced trader you should be looking for shorts, I would not consider a long unless we are over $10-12k

I am never good with words so instead of writing paragraphs of clarification to justify my call for SHORT since my last posting, I have explained everything on my chart with the least words possible using Fibonacci. It does not matter how popular  Bitcoin -1.45%  has become, or how deep it has disrupted the financial sector, or how many institutional investors have come to invest in it -- the psychology behind a market cycle does not change. 

I don't really encourage anyone to short  Bitcoin -1.45% , but in all honesty, don't expect the bulls to fly anytime soon. Like I said before, this correction that we are having right now is the ""MOTHER OF ALL CORRECTIONS"" after a 4-year-long bull cycle since the 2013 correction... and we are just halfway through.

My best idea ever, taking some time off the last 2 days :) The whales just continue to play their little games by squeezing leveraged short and long positions out of the market. Can't play them, it's just too easy. Maybe it's time we retail traders stand together, combine our  volume  and use their own game against them. Yeah, maybe we could even make a blockbuster movie about this :) I love me some science fiction :) LOL  

My last update of the previous analysis i showed 2 important support levels where the price could bounce up from. The first support around 7350 did the trick and the price got pushed back to 7700. From that point on i told my members that i thought i was seeing distribution, but it was still very confusing to figure out what was going on. TA was showing  bullish  signs, that  bull flag  was very strong and was even turning slowly up and was about to squeeze upwards. But of course out of no where the price got dumped, the move we saw a few hours ago. After that 200 point drop the price got pushed up again to 7700 like that dump was a glitch. If your a whale, why not push out leveraged traders and take your money while your accumulating or distributing. It's like a bonus, like the cherry on top :)  

Anyway, in this chart we can see allot of similarities of what is going on. As you know i have been saying i am still  bearish  for the medium term, but i just could not say what was going to happen on the short term. 2 days ago after we finally dropped out of that  wedge , i said we would have 2 options.  
- Break those 2 support levels from the last update of my previous chart (73xx and 71xx) 
- Make a higher low at those same support levels and make another move up above the high.  
 
As we can see in the chart, the  fractal  is not 100% identical so it's no guarantee that the 7700 high we just saw is the high already and that we start to move down. But based on this  fractal , i don't want to see the price get above the 7800/7900. This  fractal  confirms my  bearish  view as well. That's why TA is so great, you can turn any chart to fit your view :). 

Even without this  fractal , i just give it a very small chance that 7K price action is the fundament of a low to start another bull rally, i just highly doubt that. I want to see more  volume  to begin with and at least  double bottom  kind of formation. So the minimum i expect is a test of the 7100/6900in the coming week or 2. But the movement i have in mind for the med term is a drop below the 7K to form a big V shape low. If we get to see that, than i might even become  bullish  for the rest of the year :).  

As long as the price stays above the 73xx, we have to assume the bulls are still in control and we should see another wave up. So for me the 73xx is an important turning point.

					At the moment it looks like bulls are trying to push higher, this bull flag/triangle is still very strong. So no sign of weakness yet! First small sign would be a drop below 7620/7600. Bulls need to break 7700

Comment:
					This is my bigger picture, think this bearish triangle is still 100% in play. I think if bulls can't break the 7800/7900 the bearish version is probably going to happen. Can't say HOW it will go, this blue line is just a guess. But a big V shape low would be the most bullish for the long term. I still think we are seeing distribution here. The only way this idea can be countered, is through a big increase of buying volume, if that doesn't happen, i think it's only a matter of time.

					What a surprise, nothing has changed :) 

The price took a small dump but the volume was low so no real read on what the intent was. So we might see another move up, if we start to see a small pump that takes out the 7800, be aware of a fake breakout. The blue line is a possibility of what the move could look like IF we move up and if the breakout fails. If that happens than we will probably get confirmation if the price breaks the 7600ish. If we break the 7800 it should stay above the 7700 to confirm another move up. Not much more to say about what's going on.

Comment:
					So we have made a small drop, but there is no volume confirming it, not yet at least. First small support has been broken, but not yet very meaningful because of the low volume. For the ones who shorted it, just be aware of another squeeze up, since this small move downwards looks a bit to controlled.  

Pure TA, it broke the channel and retested the former support as resistance now.

649,1528359434.0,Taiwan_Bear,2618 (Double top & 0.618 pull-back) - do not miss it!!,"
In the last couple of TAs I have mentioned the “2618 pattern” and have been asked what 2618 means. Sorry for taking it so long as it took me quite a while to put everything altogether. But, as promised, I have explained below the rules and trade setups for the 2618 pattern.  

What are the rules/setups/steps for 2618?  
1.	Form a  double top  (Note #1)  
2.	Neckline has to be broken  
3.	After price found support at point (b), wait for pull back to 0.618 fib retracement of (a)(b)  
4.	After price retraced to 0.618, look for confluence and sell (eg. Structures,  trendlines  ,  double top  on a lower time frame,  rsi  divergence,  bearish pin bar  ,  inside bar  break down etc.) (Note #2)  
5.	Stop loss to be set above  double top 
6.	Set Take Profit levels (Note #3)  

Note #1 ( Double top ):  
The first step for the formation of 2618 is to form a  double top  at key resistance levels. Why at key resistance levels? Because we want to avoid fake double tops which can occur occasionally.  

There are some variations between various resources (books, websites) regarding the definitions of “double top”. The main differences occur where:  
a)	Some said for a  double top  to be valid, the wick of the 2nd top cannot exceed the wick of the 1st top; whereas, others said:  
b)	The wick of the 2nd top can exceed the wick of the 1st top but the candle close of the 2nd top CANNOT exceed the wick of the 1st top; or  
c)	The wick of the 2nd top can exceed the wick of the 1st top and the candle close of the 2nd top CAN exceed the wick of the 1st top; or  
d)	The wick of the 2nd top meets at least the candle close of the 1st top; or  
e)	The body of the 2nd top cannot exceed the body of the 1st top  

Personally, I would say all the above definitions work just fine although I do prefer definition a) because it means that the selling pressure is strong and the bulls fail to make a higher high. When there is a higher high formed in a downtrend, it can mean the downtrend has reversed and therefore you might not want to sell when the price pulls back to the 0.618 fib retracement.  

Note #2 ( 0.618 retracement ):  
When the price pulls back to 0.618, it does not mean to sell straight away. There must be more than one reason to sell other than the 0.618 retrace. The more reasons the better. In this example, you can see there are certainly structures (key resistance levels) at the 0.618 retrace. As well, there was a  double top  formed on the lower time frame. Consequently, you can sell.  

After  BTC -1.45%  hit the 0.618 retrace the first time, the price dropped from $9735 to $8650. but quickly bounced back to the 0.618 retrace level. That was a second & better opportunity to sell. Not only did  BTC -1.45%  form a  double top  on the larger time frame, but also with a  bearish  divergence on the 4hr time frame. Accordingly, you have more reasons to sell.  

Note #3 (Set take profit)  
Same as the rules of “Double top”, there are some variations as to which price level should you take profits. Personally, I would stick to the below:  
1)	First, take profit when risk/reward ratio hits 1:1 (recommend to take 30% - 50% profits and adjust the SL of the remaining positions to break-even)  
2)	When price hits the same price level as the low after the neckline is broken ((b) point in this example)  
3)	When price hits 1.272 fib extension of (a)(b)  
4)	When price hits point (d) (using  AB=CD  pattern. If you are not sure what the rules of  AB=CD  are, you can refer to my previous TA in which I have attached the link below)  
5)	If in a one-way market (heavily bearish/bullish), you can always keep 10% to 20% of your positions and take profits when risk/reward ratio hits 1:5 or even 1:10

 BTC -1.45%  is on the verge of breaking to a daily higher high on the bounce if the bulls can see a push this morning. 
If we reject from here the daily will form a lower high and we will see a tightening pattern within the highlighted  support and resistance  lines.  
Important for the bulls to show up or we could stay in this range into tomorrow.  
Healthy consolidation after the most recent bull move and the 15 min chart needs to change the trend.  
Also look to  EMA  12 support on the 4 hour and hourly.  
Another morning like yesterday with the bulls comfortable as worst case, we likely stay in the tightening pattern if bulls cannot prove themselves.

The current situation of  Bitcoin -1.45%  is quite difficult. We are on a clear treshold. A lot of traders are saying that we are on a clear downtrend, but the same amount of people are claiming that we will have our reversal soon. 

This article tries to sum up all important information you have to need! 

1: Retracement of a parabolic uptrend: 
There is a rule of thumb for the retracement of a parabolic uptrend. We should retrace to approx. the 0.786  Fibonacci Retracement  +/- 10%! 
Depending where we start the count, we are already in that target. Although both ways (blue and red) have still some space for a further downwave! 







2: The bloody support of Bitcoin: 
The average cost of mining one  bitcoin -1.45%  are at USA/Russia approx. 4700$ and at 3100$ for china! 
A drop below a target of 4700$ would be savage. Nevertheless, i can't image that we will hit that target. 







3: Manipulation of  Bitcoin -1.45%  and the Bart Simpson Pattern: 
A friend of mine found some unusual patterns in the orderbooks of several exchanges: 
https://twitter.com/CryptoSyndrome 
Altcoins are manipulated on a daily basis. It seems that  bitcoin -1.45%  is now affected to this too, which causes all these 3-5% pump and dumps. 
Thus, we are forming all the time the Bartin Simpsons Patterns. 

4: Similarity to 2014: 
Bitcoin -1.45%  now: 






Bitcoin -1.45%  2014: 







5: Deminishing downtrend and a strong support 
If we see the falling  wedges  as the force of the downtrend, then the force is diminishing! 
Furthermore we have strong support which is holding now for the 4th time! 







6: The Indicators 
Having a look at the indicators at 2D, we have a good potential for an upwave now. 
The  volume  is deminishing which should indicate a breakout soon. 
The  MACD  is about to cross, the  RSI  was slightly overbought and is heading up like the  Stoch .  RSI . 
The 200  EMA  is slighty under the current price and act as a support. 

7: The symetrical Triangle 
The theory says, that we should have in a  sym -1.72% . triangle 5 times an  ABC  wave. The waves are not perfect, but we can construct them. 






As you can see, the last four ABC-Waves formed always a 1:1 extention, which indicates that we have finished wave 5. 

8: A possible Head and Shoulders 
Even if this is not the most perfect  Head and Shoulders  Pattern, it's still valid! 
We are currently at the neckline, which is a strong and important resistance. Breaking upwards should indicate a good uptrend. 







9: The magic  6th 0.00%  of the month 






Suprisingly we have on every  6th 0.00%  of the month a reversal. Why is that??? 
One reason could be the  CME Group Futures  with dates for the settlements always nearby the  6th 0.00%  of the month! 
http://www.cmegroup.com 

10: Longterm  Bullish  TA 
The whole pattern could be seen as a big  bullish pennant . 







11: Shortterm  Bullish  TA 
Leading diagonal  starting wave1 of an  Elliott Wave , since we have now an impulse wave, after the 5x  ABC  pattern inside the triangle is finished. 
Our target should be at the top of the triangle nearby 8600-8800$. 







12: Longterm  Bearish  TA 
We also can argue, that we are currenty in an downtrend and the  sym -1.72% . triangle just continuing the trend. 
Our target should be nearby 6000$ which is also a finished downwards  Elliott Wave .

Nothing is happening in the market:  volatility  has become extinct and coins' trading fallen out of fashion. Range-bound bots and robotic humans absolutely prosper in this environment. The price was unable to break the 7700 threshold. For me this is a  bearish  signal. Indicators provide mixed signals, so let's examine wave structure. The move from May 29 is a  3-wave -0.12%  correction within a larger downtrend. A price drop below 7500 would confirm this scenario.

					Impulse Wave Truncation (Truncated Fifth) - 
Truncated 5th wave is when the market has become so over-extended in Wave 3 that there is not much force left for the impulse wave to come to a proper completion. So when this happens, there is a chance that the last wave of the impulse, Wave 5, will not reach the end of Wave 3 before the market starts correcting in the opposite direction. At this point, the market is just too exhausted. This condition is often called a “failure” or a “Truncation.”

I can see many people still believe that we are going inside a  descending triangle . I also believed this in my idea that i shard on may 1st: 



 

Things can change so quickly and if we didn't adapt to the changes then someone will. That's why i believe that we have to be in fast adapt mode in this market. Doesn't mean that you need to change without checking yourself. I try to find 2-3 confirmations before i change my idea on something. This includes pattern changes, trend changes etc 

There are 21 corrective wave patterns in EW which is categorized into major 3 corrective wave patterns: 

Zigzag  (5-3-5) 
Flat (3-3-5) 
Triangle (3-3-3-3-3) 

And other patterns are combinations of the above which is:  

Double three (A combination of two corrective patterns above) 
Triple three (A combination of three corrective patterns above) 

So what i can see now is that we are in two double three combination corrective wave pattern: 








More info here:  

https://elliottwave-forecast.com/elliott-wave-theory/#corrective-waves 

Confirmations: 

1. Wave ((i)) of C is 1.6k and ((v)) is going to be completed below the triangle 
2. Wave (E) of the triangle can't go beyond the triangle.  
3. This has happened twice before in 2013 & 2015 

Each wave  got 3 subwaves (a,b &c) inside and we are in the subwave c of ((y)) of Y which is an impulsive wave. 

Impulsive waves: 1,3,5,a,c 
Corrective waves: 2,4,b 

Normal Fibo Ratios for these waves are: 

wave 2 = 0.5 - 0.8 of wave 1  
wave 3 = 1.236 - 1.618 of wave 1  
wave 4 = 0.5 - 0.618 of wave 3  
wave 5 = 0.618 - 1 of wave 1  
wave B = 0.5 - 0.8 of wave A  
wave C = 0.618 - 1.236 of wave A  

Now if you check what happened in subwave a of ((y)) of Y you can see that: 

Wave (i) of a: 985$ 
Wave (ii) of a: 434$  
Wave ( iii -0.44% ) of a: 1207$  
Wave (iv) of a: 691$ [~0.618 of Wave ( iii -0.44% )] 
Wave (v) of a: 950$  








I have seen  BTC -1.45%  impulsive waves fibo ratios almost the same as the previous impulsive wave fibo ratios. 
Now if you apply the same for the last wave C of (E) this is what you get: 

Wave ((i)) of c: 1587$ 
Wave ((ii)) of c  = 793$ 
Wave (( iii -0.44% )) of c  = 1961$ 
Wave ((iv)) of c [~0.618 of Wave (( iii -0.44% ))] = 1212$ 
Wave ((v)) of c  = 1587$ 








Also note that Wave ((iv)) might not retrace upto 0.618 of Wave (( iii -0.44% )) as everyone will be in panic mode by that time so minimum retracement would be around 0.386 of Wave (( iii -0.44% )) which is around 756$ and this is why i can see it goes down to 5k level or little bit more towards 4.7k which is the lowest level of the  support zone  (orange dotted lines) 








So 3 Possible Support lines for reversal would be 

1. Blue: 5800 - 6100 (Only possible if Wave ((v)) is truncated) 
2. Orange: 4700 - 5000 (This is most likely where we heading)  
3. Red: 4100 - 4400 (Only possible if Wave (( iii -0.44% )) is extended)

 Bitcoin -1.43%  has recently developed an interesting pattern of completing a  bullish  and  bearish  cycle on the sixth of every month in an alternating order. As we can see in the chart above, a fall is followed by a rise. This has happened twice before and is expected to happen again now on the  6th 0.00%  of June, 2018. This time  Bitcoin -1.43%  will finish a  bearish  cycle and I expected to begin the next  bullish  cycle at least till the end of  6th 0.00%  of July, 2018. 

This pattern of rise and fall is also supported by other patterns on the chart that signal a  bullish  reversal. The support line has also held firmly and if this pattern of alternating rise and fall ensues,  Bitcoin -1.43%  could very well make new highs by the end of the year. The  RSI  is recovering from oversold levels and has now approached a normal.  Bitcoin -1.43%  is currently at a favorable point for  bullish  entries. The price broke a long term resistance as it break past the downtrend line in April, 2018. This was a big accomplishment for the bulls but the lack of confidence pulled the price back to the support line. Currently, the price is just above the support line and appears to be all set for a  bullish  comeback but the reality is, there are not enough bulls in the market. 

The past few months have been devastating for the price of  Bitcoin -1.43%  ( BTC -1.43% ) and a lot of investors are still running scared. Institutional investors are looking for more clarity regarding regulations concerning cryptocurrencies and also safer ways to invest and store their coins. As for retail investors, most of them comprise of first time investors who have never traded any financial asset before. So, when they saw that  Bitcoin -1.43%  ( BTC -1.43% ) is making 20% gains every day, they thought this could go on forever and jumped with both feet, only to find the carpet pulled under from their feet. Big investors have always played small investors as cannon fodder and have gotten away with their schemes even in regulated markets like forex or the stock market. Cryptocurrencies is a new market with no proper regulations which means it is natural to expect that those who can afford to not play by the rules, most likely won’t.

Hello friends,  

It's been a while since my last post; lack of time and an urge to do more research has mainly driven me to take a break from posting ideas on TradingView. I am still in the process of doing more research and study, but I figure posting once in a while couldn't hurt. 

Since I have become recently very convinced about this, I am outlining a very possible situation with  Bitcoin -1.45%  where the  trend line  we have been on since early October breaks, reaching around a temporary low of $5000. This is examined on the  daily chart , since this is one of the best charts to examine trends of this size. I have to first and foremost say that I am not trying to spread fear, I know many people do not like to hear  bearish  ideas, but  technical analysis  is ultimately a rational exercise, and I feel that possibilities with very strong signs should be explored. 

There are a few things to look at, but I first want to talk about the big picture with, long-term  support and resistance  lines. I think most people can agree that there was a very significant downtrending resistance line that began from the peak of the  ATH 0.63%  in late December, to the low of around $6400 (thick red line). After the break from that line, it seems we moved into a sideways trend, bouncing back and forth between an emerging downtrending resistance line (light red) and a support line that we seem to have been respecting since mid-October (light green); at least this appears to be the case with the lows, where the angle's effectiveness appears very strongly. Finally, based on previous bounces, we can establish a support of around $5000-$5300 (I've thus created a small  support zone  around that range, in dark green), as well as lower supports around $3200 and $2000 (though I do not believe these will be reached, in dark green).   

Now, onto the analysis - it's no secret that  Bitcoin -1.45%  has been squeezing in, ready for a significant move either upwards or downwards. Initially I considered the upwards move to be more likely due to the significant media attention cryptocurrency has been receiving, but after viewing previous market cycles of  Bitcoin -1.45%  (check 2013), it seems clear to me that the  bearish  scenario of closing in on the market cycle is very likely, and should at the very least be prepared for with proper risk management. According to Dow Theory, which is said to have laid the foundations of modern  technical analysis , history repeats itself, and this is a situation where we forced to consider this. 

Should we break from the line, we will likely fall straight down to the $5000-$5000 area, where we will shoot back up and bounce towards around $6700 or so (maybe a little less). From there one, we will likely enter a sideways trend, which we will continue until we see higher highs and higher lows and parabolic movement returns, which could lead to us challenging the all-time high, and hitting $35k-$50k. 

NOTE: I seem to have reached the max character limit for this section of the idea, so I will continue my text below.

Comment:
					Onto the short-term: 


Scenario A: 

The reason why I have drawn this movement into a pennant is this way, is simply because we have been moving through this ascending triangle for quite a while now (May 23rd to today). I don't think that the pattern will be sufficient to directly lead into a strong sell-off, but we should consider that the size of ascending triangle suggests a small movement downwards at the very least, which can create a higher low, and thus move into position into a bearish pennant. Why would a bearish pennant occur here and not have a bounce to $8500-$8700? The reason is in positioning - the huge downtrend (May 5th to May 26th) creates a very nice flagpole in which it hits around the $5000 area very perfectly, and thus I would not be surprised if this happens. 

Second reason: on the Stoch RSI indicator on the daily chart, it appears to be dangerously high, which would suggest it being oversold. For the most part, it seems to have called lows and highs, at least to some extent. This overdrawn movement may very well have increased the likelyhood of Bitcoin being oversold. This could suggest that this is the last step into a sharp downturn, but this does not preclude Situation B. Volume has also been steadily decreasing, but this is the case with any sort of consolidation, I believe. 

Finally, the lines I have drawn below the triangle are simply bounces that I think seem fairly reasonable. The length from to support to the lines correlate with the length of the flagpole, of course, though it may seem chopped off due to the huge line from the long-term support downwards. 


Scenario B: 

This is much simpler, Bitcoin hits the upper resistance line, bounces off, challenges the lower support line, and we potentially see a break, and the rest unfolds from there. 


----------------------------------------------------------------------- 


With all this being said, do not fear if you are hoping for more parabolic movement - this likely will not be the end, and will simply be the set up for a long, drawn out sideways movement until the first signs of bullish activity begin and we start all over again. If you are longing around here, please consider using risk management, prepare for every possibility. If you are shorting, the same applies. 

Please trade with care. I wish the best to all traders!

Comment:
					This really is a very minor note, but I just want to emphasize that the rising wedge (which I erroneously refer to as an ascending triangle, a bad habit I have) entering a bearish pennant is more based on intuition than anything. Also, this pennant is mainly based on the conservative assumption that the break will happen at 7900, if it happens at 7700 where we seem to be general resistance, the pennant would look something like this:

Jun 7




I am Mid term-bullish on  BTC -1.45%  going into the end of this week, but looking to get into the market on a pull back to occur before I get in to the market.  The jury is still out as to whether this weekly bear trend is ready to turn around.  

We can see that both the  RSI  and  MFI  are both  Bullish  on the daily having bottomed when reaching oversold on both at c. $7k support where we found our longer term  trend line . 

We are currently in the process of meeting the Tenkan (blue line) as I write this, so in the very short term, I am looking for a pull back to $7550 range for an entry.  One of the main reasons for this is that on the 4hour timeframes we are close to completing an edge to edge trade so the risk reward doesn’t fit my profile, however a break out from the cloud or above the Tenkan around $7777 will make me enter the market. 

The  RSI  and  MFI  have both been excellent indicators in this bear market.  Whenever  RSI  has gone above the 60 and the  MFI  80; its time to exit the market from a  bullish  trade and consider shorting as it progresses higher.   

Based on the  RSI ,  MFI  trends and the fact that we will run into the Kijun at just around $8-8.2k, I will be scalling out at this  bearish  confluence level to start looking for pull backs and reassessment as i believe it to be a key point as  

Best case scenario this trade would yield a 10% return before leverage. 
This is for illustrative purposes only, please DYOR and goodluck with your trading.

So the pullback trade that we were looking at worked out & has made it's way back to the neckline level of structure. We are now at what i like to call a ""decision point"" Essentially IF price is able to violate this current level od structure THEN we're likely to continue to our next price projection.  

Something that a lot of newer traders don't understand is that when it comes to bigger moves, the market will often provide multiple opportunities to get involved. For those who don't rush and for those who don't get discouraged. If you perform consistent analysis you can often find multiple ways to involve yourself in a trade even if you missed the first strike.

I am not calculating the time I'm just making a technical drawing of the directions that we will see in the next few months.  

Recent price action has clear signs of wash trading / market manipulation fud and lots of nonsense. Its hard to prove almost impossible so as a trader we just need to deal with it. Ideally the situation you are supposed to trade are critical break up and break down points to enter the trade. Dont enter or exit dumb trades and lose money.

I am never good with words so instead of writing paragraphs of clarification to justify my call for SHORT since my last posting, I have explained everything on my chart with the least words possible using Fibonacci. It does not matter how popular  Bitcoin -1.44%  has become, or how deep it has disrupted the financial sector, or how many institutional investors have come to invest in it -- the psychology behind a market cycle does not change. 

I don't really encourage anyone to short  Bitcoin -1.44% , but in all honesty, don't expect the bulls to fly anytime soon.

My best idea ever, taking some time off the last 2 days :) The whales just continue to play their little games by squeezing leveraged short and long positions out of the market. Can't play them, it's just too easy. Maybe it's time we retail traders stand together, combine our  volume  and use their own game against them. Yeah, maybe we could even make a blockbuster movie about this :) I love me some science fiction :) LOL  

My last update of the previous analysis i showed 2 important support levels where the price could bounce up from. The first support around 7350 did the trick and the price got pushed back to 7700. From that point on i told my members that i thought i was seeing distribution, but it was still very confusing to figure out what was going on. TA was showing  bullish  signs, that  bull flag  was very strong and was even turning slowly up and was about to squeeze upwards. But of course out of no where the price got dumped, the move we saw a few hours ago. After that 200 point drop the price got pushed up again to 7700 like that dump was a glitch. If your a whale, why not push out leveraged traders and take your money while your accumulating or distributing. It's like a bonus, like the cherry on top :)  

Anyway, in this chart we can see allot of similarities of what is going on. As you know i have been saying i am still  bearish  for the medium term, but i just could not say what was going to happen on the short term. 2 days ago after we finally dropped out of that  wedge , i said we would have 2 options.  
- Break those 2 support levels from the last update of my previous chart (73xx and 71xx) 
- Make a higher low at those same support levels and make another move up above the high.  
 
As we can see in the chart, the  fractal  is not 100% identical so it's no guarantee that the 7700 high we just saw is the high already and that we start to move down. But based on this  fractal , i don't want to see the price get above the 7800/7900. This  fractal  confirms my  bearish  view as well. That's why TA is so great, you can turn any chart to fit your view :). 

Even without this  fractal , i just give it a very small chance that 7K price action is the fundament of a low to start another bull rally, i just highly doubt that. I want to see more  volume  to begin with and at least  double bottom  kind of formation. So the minimum i expect is a test of the 7100/6900in the coming week or 2. But the movement i have in mind for the med term is a drop below the 7K to form a big V shape low. If we get to see that, than i might even become  bullish  for the rest of the year :).  

As long as the price stays above the 73xx, we have to assume the bulls are still in control and we should see another wave up. So for me the 73xx is an important turning point.

					At the moment it looks like bulls are trying to push higher, this bull flag/triangle is still very strong. So no sign of weakness yet! First small sign would be a drop below 7620/7600. Bulls need to break 7700

					This is my bigger picture, think this bearish triangle is still 100% in play. I think if bulls can't break the 7800/7900 the bearish version is probably going to happen. Can't say HOW it will go, this blue line is just a guess. But a big V shape low would be the most bullish for the long term. I still think we are seeing distribution here. The only way this idea can be countered, is through a big increase of buying volume, if that doesn't happen, i think it's only a matter of time.

					Lower time frame we can see a new upwards channel and maybe even a rising wedge. From the looks of it, it's slowly going down to test the support line again. Depending on what will happen there we can make a better prediction for the rest of the day.

					What a surprise, nothing has changed :) 

The price took a small dump but the volume was low so no real read on what the intent was. So we might see another move up, if we start to see a small pump that takes out the 7800, be aware of a fake breakout. The blue line is a possibility of what the move could look like IF we move up and if the breakout fails. If that happens than we will probably get confirmation if the price breaks the 7600ish. If we break the 7800 it should stay above the 7700 to confirm another move up. Not much more to say about what's going on.

					So we have made a small drop, but there is no volume confirming it, not yet at least. First small support has been broken, but not yet very meaningful because of the low volume. For the ones who shorted it, just be aware of another squeeze up, since this small move downwards looks a bit to controlled.  

Pure TA, it broke the channel and retested the former support as resistance now.

4.	After price retraced to 0.618, look for confluence and sell (eg. Structures,  trendlines  ,  double top  on a lower time frame,  rsi  divergence,  bearish pin bar  ,  inside bar  break down etc.) (Note #2)  
5.	Stop loss to be set above  double top 
6.	Set Take Profit levels (Note #3)  

Note #1 ( Double top ):  
The first step for the formation of 2618 is to form a  double top  at key resistance levels. Why at key resistance levels? Because we want to avoid fake double tops which can occur occasionally.  

There are some variations between various resources (books, websites) regarding the definitions of “double top”. The main differences occur where:  
a)	Some said for a  double top  to be valid, the wick of the 2nd top cannot exceed the wick of the 1st top; whereas, others said:  
b)	The wick of the 2nd top can exceed the wick of the 1st top but the candle close of the 2nd top CANNOT exceed the wick of the 1st top; or  
c)	The wick of the 2nd top can exceed the wick of the 1st top and the candle close of the 2nd top CAN exceed the wick of the 1st top; or  
d)	The wick of the 2nd top meets at least the candle close of the 1st top; or  
e)	The body of the 2nd top cannot exceed the body of the 1st top  

Personally, I would say all the above definitions work just fine although I do prefer definition a) because it means that the selling pressure is strong and the bulls fail to make a higher high. When there is a higher high formed in a downtrend, it can mean the downtrend has reversed and therefore you might not want to sell when the price pulls back to the 0.618 fib retracement.  

Note #2 ( 0.618 retracement ):  
When the price pulls back to 0.618, it does not mean to sell straight away. There must be more than one reason to sell other than the 0.618 retrace. The more reasons the better. In this example, you can see there are certainly structures (key resistance levels) at the 0.618 retrace. As well, there was a  double top  formed on the lower time frame. Consequently, you can sell.  

After  BTC -1.46%  hit the 0.618 retrace the first time, the price dropped from $9735 to $8650. but quickly bounced back to the 0.618 retrace level. That was a second & better opportunity to sell. Not only did  BTC -1.46%  form a  double top  on the larger time frame, but also with a  bearish  divergence on the 4hr time frame. Accordingly, you have more reasons to sell.  

Note #3 (Set take profit)  
Same as the rules of “Double top”, there are some variations as to which price level should you take profits. Personally, I would stick to the below:  
1)	First, take profit when risk/reward ratio hits 1:1 (recommend to take 30% - 50% profits and adjust the SL of the remaining positions to break-even)  
2)	When price hits the same price level as the low after the neckline is broken ((b) point in this example)  
3)	When price hits 1.272 fib extension of (a)(b)  
4)	When price hits point (d) (using  AB=CD  pattern. If you are not sure what the rules of  AB=CD  are, you can refer to my previous TA in which I have attached the link below)  
5)	If in a one-way market (heavily bearish/bullish), you can always keep 10% to 20% of your positions and take profits when risk/reward ratio hits 1:5 or even 1:10

 BTC -1.46%  is on the verge of breaking to a daily higher high on the bounce if the bulls can see a push this morning. 
If we reject from here the daily will form a lower high and we will see a tightening pattern within the highlighted  support and resistance  lines.  
Important for the bulls to show up or we could stay in this range into tomorrow.  
Healthy consolidation after the most recent bull move and the 15 min chart needs to change the trend.  
Also look to  EMA  12 support on the 4 hour and hourly.  
Another morning like yesterday with the bulls comfortable as worst case, we likely stay in the tightening pattern if bulls cannot prove themselves.

The current situation of  Bitcoin -1.48%  is quite difficult. We are on a clear treshold. A lot of traders are saying that we are on a clear downtrend, but the same amount of people are claiming that we will have our reversal soon. 

This article tries to sum up all important information you have to need! 

1: Retracement of a parabolic uptrend: 
There is a rule of thumb for the retracement of a parabolic uptrend. We should retrace to approx. the 0.786  Fibonacci Retracement  +/- 10%! 
Depending where we start the count, we are already in that target. Although both ways (blue and red) have still some space for a further downwave! 







2: The bloody support of Bitcoin: 
The average cost of mining one  bitcoin -1.48%  are at USA/Russia approx. 4700$ and at 3100$ for china! 
A drop below a target of 4700$ would be savage. Nevertheless, i can't image that we will hit that target. 







3: Manipulation of  Bitcoin -1.48%  and the Bart Simpson Pattern: 
A friend of mine found some unusual patterns in the orderbooks of several exchanges: 
https://twitter.com/CryptoSyndrome 
Altcoins are manipulated on a daily basis. It seems that  bitcoin -1.48%  is now affected to this too, which causes all these 3-5% pump and dumps. 
Thus, we are forming all the time the Bartin Simpsons Patterns. 

4: Similarity to 2014: 
Bitcoin -1.48%  now: 






Bitcoin -1.48%  2014: 







5: Deminishing downtrend and a strong support 
If we see the falling  wedges  as the force of the downtrend, then the force is diminishing! 
Furthermore we have strong support which is holding now for the 4th time! 







6: The Indicators 
Having a look at the indicators at 2D, we have a good potential for an upwave now. 
The  volume  is deminishing which should indicate a breakout soon. 
The  MACD  is about to cross, the  RSI  was slightly overbought and is heading up like the  Stoch .  RSI . 
The 200  EMA  is slighty under the current price and act as a support. 

7: The symetrical Triangle 
The theory says, that we should have in a  sym -0.80% . triangle 5 times an  ABC  wave. The waves are not perfect, but we can construct them. 






As you can see, the last four ABC-Waves formed always a 1:1 extention, which indicates that we have finished wave 5. 

8: A possible Head and Shoulders 
Even if this is not the most perfect  Head and Shoulders  Pattern, it's still valid! 
We are currently at the neckline, which is a strong and important resistance. Breaking upwards should indicate a good uptrend. 







9: The magic  6th 0.00%  of the month 






Suprisingly we have on every  6th 0.00%  of the month a reversal. Why is that??? 
One reason could be the  CME Group Futures  with dates for the settlements always nearby the  6th 0.00%  of the month! 
http://www.cmegroup.com 

10: Longterm  Bullish  TA 
The whole pattern could be seen as a big  bullish pennant . 







11: Shortterm  Bullish  TA 
Leading diagonal  starting wave1 of an  Elliott Wave , since we have now an impulse wave, after the 5x  ABC  pattern inside the triangle is finished. 
Our target should be at the top of the triangle nearby 8600-8800$. 







12: Longterm  Bearish  TA 
We also can argue, that we are currenty in an downtrend and the  sym -0.80% . triangle just continuing the trend. 
Our target should be nearby 6000$ which is also a finished downwards  Elliott Wave .

Nothing is happening in the market:  volatility  has become extinct and coins' trading fallen out of fashion. Range-bound bots and robotic humans absolutely prosper in this environment. The price was unable to break the 7700 threshold. For me this is a  bearish  signal. Indicators provide mixed signals, so let's examine wave structure. The move from May 29 is a  3-wave -0.12%  correction within a larger downtrend. A price drop below 7500 would confirm this scenario.

					Impulse Wave Truncation (Truncated Fifth) - 
Truncated 5th wave is when the market has become so over-extended in Wave 3 that there is not much force left for the impulse wave to come to a proper completion. So when this happens, there is a chance that the last wave of the impulse, Wave 5, will not reach the end of Wave 3 before the market starts correcting in the opposite direction. At this point, the market is just too exhausted. This condition is often called a “failure” or a “Truncation.”

I can see many people still believe that we are going inside a  descending triangle . I also believed this in my idea that i shard on may 1st: 



 

Things can change so quickly and if we didn't adapt to the changes then someone will. That's why i believe that we have to be in fast adapt mode in this market. Doesn't mean that you need to change without checking yourself. I try to find 2-3 confirmations before i change my idea on something. This includes pattern changes, trend changes etc 

There are 21 corrective wave patterns in EW which is categorized into major 3 corrective wave patterns: 

Zigzag  (5-3-5) 
Flat (3-3-5) 
Triangle (3-3-3-3-3) 

And other patterns are combinations of the above which is:  

Double three (A combination of two corrective patterns above) 
Triple three (A combination of three corrective patterns above) 

So what i can see now is that we are in two double three combination corrective wave pattern: 








More info here:  

https://elliottwave-forecast.com/elliott-wave-theory/#corrective-waves 

Confirmations: 

1. Wave ((i)) of C is 1.6k and ((v)) is going to be completed below the triangle 
2. Wave (E) of the triangle can't go beyond the triangle.  
3. This has happened twice before in 2013 & 2015 

Each wave  got 3 subwaves (a,b &c) inside and we are in the subwave c of ((y)) of Y which is an impulsive wave. 

Impulsive waves: 1,3,5,a,c 
Corrective waves: 2,4,b 

Normal Fibo Ratios for these waves are: 

wave 2 = 0.5 - 0.8 of wave 1  
wave 3 = 1.236 - 1.618 of wave 1  
wave 4 = 0.5 - 0.618 of wave 3  
wave 5 = 0.618 - 1 of wave 1  
wave B = 0.5 - 0.8 of wave A  
wave C = 0.618 - 1.236 of wave A  

Now if you check what happened in subwave a of ((y)) of Y you can see that: 

Wave (i) of a: 985$ 
Wave (ii) of a: 434$  
Wave ( iii -0.44% ) of a: 1207$  
Wave (iv) of a: 691$ [~0.618 of Wave ( iii -0.44% )] 
Wave (v) of a: 950$  








I have seen  BTC -1.48%  impulsive waves fibo ratios almost the same as the previous impulsive wave fibo ratios. 
Now if you apply the same for the last wave C of (E) this is what you get: 

Wave ((i)) of c: 1587$ 
Wave ((ii)) of c  = 793$ 
Wave (( iii -0.44% )) of c  = 1961$ 
Wave ((iv)) of c [~0.618 of Wave (( iii -0.44% ))] = 1212$ 
Wave ((v)) of c  = 1587$ 








Also note that Wave ((iv)) might not retrace upto 0.618 of Wave (( iii -0.44% )) as everyone will be in panic mode by that time so minimum retracement would be around 0.386 of Wave (( iii -0.44% )) which is around 756$ and this is why i can see it goes down to 5k level or little bit more towards 4.7k which is the lowest level of the  support zone  (orange dotted lines) 








So 3 Possible Support lines for reversal would be 

1. Blue: 5800 - 6100 (Only possible if Wave ((v)) is truncated) 
2. Orange: 4700 - 5000 (This is most likely where we heading)  
3. Red: 4100 - 4400 (Only possible if Wave (( iii -0.44% )) is extended)

 Bitcoin -1.51%  has recently developed an interesting pattern of completing a  bullish  and  bearish  cycle on the sixth of every month in an alternating order. As we can see in the chart above, a fall is followed by a rise. This has happened twice before and is expected to happen again now on the  6th 0.00%  of June, 2018. This time  Bitcoin -1.51%  will finish a  bearish  cycle and I expected to begin the next  bullish  cycle at least till the end of  6th 0.00%  of July, 2018. 

This pattern of rise and fall is also supported by other patterns on the chart that signal a  bullish  reversal. The support line has also held firmly and if this pattern of alternating rise and fall ensues,  Bitcoin -1.51%  could very well make new highs by the end of the year. The  RSI  is recovering from oversold levels and has now approached a normal.  Bitcoin -1.51%  is currently at a favorable point for  bullish  entries. The price broke a long term resistance as it break past the downtrend line in April, 2018. This was a big accomplishment for the bulls but the lack of confidence pulled the price back to the support line. Currently, the price is just above the support line and appears to be all set for a  bullish  comeback but the reality is, there are not enough bulls in the market. 

The past few months have been devastating for the price of  Bitcoin -1.51%  ( BTC -1.51% ) and a lot of investors are still running scared. Institutional investors are looking for more clarity regarding regulations concerning cryptocurrencies and also safer ways to invest and store their coins. As for retail investors, most of them comprise of first time investors who have never traded any financial asset before. So, when they saw that  Bitcoin -1.51%  ( BTC -1.51% ) is making 20% gains every day, they thought this could go on forever and jumped with both feet, only to find the carpet pulled under from their feet. Big investors have always played small investors as cannon fodder and have gotten away with their schemes even in regulated markets like forex or the stock market. Cryptocurrencies is a new market with no proper regulations which means it is natural to expect that those who can afford to not play by the rules, most likely won’t.

Hello friends,  

It's been a while since my last post; lack of time and an urge to do more research has mainly driven me to take a break from posting ideas on TradingView. I am still in the process of doing more research and study, but I figure posting once in a while couldn't hurt. 

Since I have become recently very convinced about this, I am outlining a very possible situation with  Bitcoin              where the  trend line  we have been on since early October breaks, reaching around a temporary low of $5000. This is examined on the  daily chart , since this is one of the best charts to examine trends of this size. I have to first and foremost say that I am not trying to spread fear, I know many people do not like to hear  bearish  ideas, but  technical analysis  is ultimately a rational exercise, and I feel that possibilities with very strong signs should be explored. 

There are a few things to look at, but I first want to talk about the big picture with, long-term  support and resistance  lines. I think most people can agree that there was a very significant downtrending resistance line that began from the peak of the  ATH              in late December, to the low of around $6400 (thick red line). After the break from that line, it seems we moved into a sideways trend, bouncing back and forth between an emerging downtrending resistance line (light red) and a support line that we seem to have been respecting since mid-October (light green); at least this appears to be the case with the lows, where the angle's effectiveness appears very strongly. Finally, based on previous bounces, we can establish a support of around $5000-$5300 (I've thus created a small  support zone  around that range, in dark green), as well as lower supports around $3200 and $2000 (though I do not believe these will be reached, in dark green).   

Now, onto the analysis - it's no secret that  Bitcoin              has been squeezing in, ready for a significant move either upwards or downwards. Initially I considered the upwards move to be more likely due to the significant media attention cryptocurrency has been receiving, but after viewing previous market cycles of  Bitcoin              (check 2013), it seems clear to me that the  bearish  scenario of closing in on the market cycle is very likely, and should at the very least be prepared for with proper risk management. According to Dow Theory, which is said to have laid the foundations of modern  technical analysis , history repeats itself, and this is a situation where we forced to consider this. 

Should we break from the line, we will likely fall straight down to the $5000-$5000 area, where we will shoot back up and bounce towards around $6700 or so (maybe a little less). From there one, we will likely enter a sideways trend, which we will continue until we see higher highs and higher lows and parabolic movement returns, which could lead to us challenging the all-time high, and hitting $35k-$50k. 

NOTE: I seem to have reached the max character limit for this section of the idea, so I will continue my text below.

Comment:
					Onto the short-term: 


Scenario A: 

The reason why I have drawn this movement into a pennant is this way, is simply because we have been moving through this ascending triangle for quite a while now (May 23rd to today). I don't think that the pattern will be sufficient to directly lead into a strong sell-off, but we should consider that the size of ascending triangle suggests a small movement downwards at the very least, which can create a higher low, and thus move into position into a bearish pennant. Why would a bearish pennant occur here and not have a bounce to $8500-$8700? The reason is in positioning - the huge downtrend (May 5th to May 26th) creates a very nice flagpole in which it hits around the $5000 area very perfectly, and thus I would not be surprised if this happens. 

Second reason: on the Stoch RSI indicator on the daily chart, it appears to be dangerously high, which would suggest it being oversold. For the most part, it seems to have called lows and highs, at least to some extent. This overdrawn movement may very well have increased the likelyhood of Bitcoin being oversold. This could suggest that this is the last step into a sharp downturn, but this does not preclude Situation B. Volume has also been steadily decreasing, but this is the case with any sort of consolidation, I believe. 

Finally, the lines I have drawn below the triangle are simply bounces that I think seem fairly reasonable. The length from to support to the lines correlate with the length of the flagpole, of course, though it may seem chopped off due to the huge line from the long-term support downwards. 


Scenario B: 

This is much simpler, Bitcoin hits the upper resistance line, bounces off, challenges the lower support line, and we potentially see a break, and the rest unfolds from there. 


----------------------------------------------------------------------- 


With all this being said, do not fear if you are hoping for more parabolic movement - this likely will not be the end, and will simply be the set up for a long, drawn out sideways movement until the first signs of bullish activity begin and we start all over again. If you are longing around here, please consider using risk management, prepare for every possibility. If you are shorting, the same applies. 

Please trade with care. I wish the best to all traders!

Comment:
					This really is a very minor note, but I just want to emphasize that the rising wedge (which I erroneously refer to as an ascending triangle, a bad habit I have) entering a bearish pennant is more based on intuition than anything. Also, this pennant is mainly based on the conservative assumption that the break will happen at 7900, if it happens at 7700 where we seem to be general resistance, the pennant would look something like this:

I am Mid term-bullish on  BTC -1.49%  going into the end of this week, but looking to get into the market on a pull back to occur before I get in to the market.  The jury is still out as to whether this weekly bear trend is ready to turn around.  

We can see that both the  RSI  and  MFI  are both  Bullish  on the daily having bottomed when reaching oversold on both at c. $7k support where we found our longer term  trend line . 

We are currently in the process of meeting the Tenkan (blue line) as I write this, so in the very short term, I am looking for a pull back to $7550 range for an entry.  One of the main reasons for this is that on the 4hour timeframes we are close to completing an edge to edge trade so the risk reward doesn’t fit my profile, however a break out from the cloud or above the Tenkan around $7777 will make me enter the market. 

The  RSI  and  MFI  have both been excellent indicators in this bear market.  Whenever  RSI  has gone above the 60 and the  MFI  80; its time to exit the market from a  bullish  trade and consider shorting as it progresses higher.   

Based on the  RSI ,  MFI  trends and the fact that we will run into the Kijun at just around $8-8.2k, I will be scalling out at this  bearish  confluence level to start looking for pull backs and reassessment as i believe it to be a key point as  

Best case scenario this trade would yield a 10% return before leverage. 
This is for illustrative purposes only, please DYOR and goodluck with your trading.

So the pullback trade that we were looking at worked out & has made it's way back to the neckline level of structure. We are now at what i like to call a ""decision point"" Essentially IF price is able to violate this current level od structure THEN we're likely to continue to our next price projection.  

Something that a lot of newer traders don't understand is that when it comes to bigger moves, the market will often provide multiple opportunities to get involved. For those who don't rush and for those who don't get discouraged. If you perform consistent analysis you can often find multiple ways to involve yourself in a trade even if you missed the first strike.

This is the way markets move, If you question my charting check my previous posts. Its as simple as pie. We are going down, How long and how far is too soon to say. Here is a chart that we can understand the future price action and where to buy back. Before you guys start blasting my comment section with the time and how it may not be right thats correct. I am not calculating the time I'm just making a technical drawing of the directions that we will see in the next few months.  

Recent price action has clear signs of wash trading / market manipulation fud and lots of nonsense. Its hard to prove almost impossible so as a trader we just need to deal with it. Ideally the situation you are supposed to trade are critical break up and break down points to enter the trade. Dont enter or exit dumb trades and lose money. As an experienced trader you should be looking for shorts, I would not consider a long unless we are over $10-12k  


Happy Trading

I am never good with words so instead of writing paragraphs of clarification to justify my call for SHORT since my last posting, I have explained everything on my chart with the least words possible using Fibonacci. It does not matter how popular  Bitcoin -1.48%  has become, or how deep it has disrupted the financial sector, or how many institutional investors have come to invest in it -- the psychology behind a market cycle does not change. 

I don't really encourage anyone to short  Bitcoin -1.48% , but in all honesty, don't expect the bulls to fly anytime soon. Like I said before, this correction that we are having right now is the ""MOTHER OF ALL CORRECTIONS"" after a 4-year-long bull cycle since the 2013 correction... and we are just halfway through.

My best idea ever, taking some time off the last 2 days :) The whales just continue to play their little games by squeezing leveraged short and long positions out of the market. Can't play them, it's just too easy. Maybe it's time we retail traders stand together, combine our  volume  and use their own game against them. Yeah, maybe we could even make a blockbuster movie about this :) I love me some science fiction :) LOL  

My last update of the previous analysis i showed 2 important support levels where the price could bounce up from. The first support around 7350 did the trick and the price got pushed back to 7700. From that point on i told my members that i thought i was seeing distribution, but it was still very confusing to figure out what was going on. TA was showing  bullish  signs, that  bull flag  was very strong and was even turning slowly up and was about to squeeze upwards. But of course out of no where the price got dumped, the move we saw a few hours ago. After that 200 point drop the price got pushed up again to 7700 like that dump was a glitch. If your a whale, why not push out leveraged traders and take your money while your accumulating or distributing. It's like a bonus, like the cherry on top :)  

Anyway, in this chart we can see allot of similarities of what is going on. As you know i have been saying i am still  bearish  for the medium term, but i just could not say what was going to happen on the short term. 2 days ago after we finally dropped out of that  wedge , i said we would have 2 options.  
- Break those 2 support levels from the last update of my previous chart (73xx and 71xx) 
- Make a higher low at those same support levels and make another move up above the high.  
 
As we can see in the chart, the  fractal  is not 100% identical so it's no guarantee that the 7700 high we just saw is the high already and that we start to move down. But based on this  fractal , i don't want to see the price get above the 7800/7900. This  fractal  confirms my  bearish  view as well. That's why TA is so great, you can turn any chart to fit your view :). 

Even without this  fractal , i just give it a very small chance that 7K price action is the fundament of a low to start another bull rally, i just highly doubt that. I want to see more  volume  to begin with and at least  double bottom  kind of formation. So the minimum i expect is a test of the 7100/6900in the coming week or 2. But the movement i have in mind for the med term is a drop below the 7K to form a big V shape low. If we get to see that, than i might even become  bullish  for the rest of the year :).  

As long as the price stays above the 73xx, we have to assume the bulls are still in control and we should see another wave up. So for me the 73xx is an important turning point.

Comment:
					At the moment it looks like bulls are trying to push higher, this bull flag/triangle is still very strong. So no sign of weakness yet! First small sign would be a drop below 7620/7600. Bulls need to break 7700

Comment:
					This is my bigger picture, think this bearish triangle is still 100% in play. I think if bulls can't break the 7800/7900 the bearish version is probably going to happen. Can't say HOW it will go, this blue line is just a guess. But a big V shape low would be the most bullish for the long term. I still think we are seeing distribution here. The only way this idea can be countered, is through a big increase of buying volume, if that doesn't happen, i think it's only a matter of time.

Comment:
					Lower time frame we can see a new upwards channel and maybe even a rising wedge. From the looks of it, it's slowly going down to test the support line again. Depending on what will happen there we can make a better prediction for the rest of the day.

Comment:
					What a surprise, nothing has changed :) 

The price took a small dump but the volume was low so no real read on what the intent was. So we might see another move up, if we start to see a small pump that takes out the 7800, be aware of a fake breakout. The blue line is a possibility of what the move could look like IF we move up and if the breakout fails. If that happens than we will probably get confirmation if the price breaks the 7600ish. If we break the 7800 it should stay above the 7700 to confirm another move up. Not much more to say about what's going on.

Comment:
					So we have made a small drop, but there is no volume confirming it, not yet at least. First small support has been broken, but not yet very meaningful because of the low volume. For the ones who shorted it, just be aware of another squeeze up, since this small move downwards looks a bit to controlled.  

Pure TA, it broke the channel and retested the former support as resistance now.

685,1528359434.0,Taiwan_Bear,2618 (Double top & 0.618 pull-back) - do not miss it!!,"
In the last couple of TAs I have mentioned the “2618 pattern” and have been asked what 2618 means. Sorry for taking it so long as it took me quite a while to put everything altogether. But, as promised, I have explained below the rules and trade setups for the 2618 pattern.  

What are the rules/setups/steps for 2618?  
1.	Form a  double top  (Note #1)  
2.	Neckline has to be broken  
3.	After price found support at point (b), wait for pull back to 0.618 fib retracement of (a)(b)  
4.	After price retraced to 0.618, look for confluence and sell (eg. Structures,  trendlines  ,  double top  on a lower time frame,  rsi  divergence,  bearish pin bar  ,  inside bar  break down etc.) (Note #2)  
5.	Stop loss to be set above  double top 
6.	Set Take Profit levels (Note #3)  

Note #1 ( Double top ):  
The first step for the formation of 2618 is to form a  double top  at key resistance levels. Why at key resistance levels? Because we want to avoid fake double tops which can occur occasionally.  

There are some variations between various resources (books, websites) regarding the definitions of “double top”. The main differences occur where:  
a)	Some said for a  double top  to be valid, the wick of the 2nd top cannot exceed the wick of the 1st top; whereas, others said:  
b)	The wick of the 2nd top can exceed the wick of the 1st top but the candle close of the 2nd top CANNOT exceed the wick of the 1st top; or  
c)	The wick of the 2nd top can exceed the wick of the 1st top and the candle close of the 2nd top CAN exceed the wick of the 1st top; or  
d)	The wick of the 2nd top meets at least the candle close of the 1st top; or  
e)	The body of the 2nd top cannot exceed the body of the 1st top  

Personally, I would say all the above definitions work just fine although I do prefer definition a) because it means that the selling pressure is strong and the bulls fail to make a higher high. When there is a higher high formed in a downtrend, it can mean the downtrend has reversed and therefore you might not want to sell when the price pulls back to the 0.618 fib retracement.  

Note #2 ( 0.618 retracement ):  
When the price pulls back to 0.618, it does not mean to sell straight away. There must be more than one reason to sell other than the 0.618 retrace. The more reasons the better. In this example, you can see there are certainly structures (key resistance levels) at the 0.618 retrace. As well, there was a  double top  formed on the lower time frame. Consequently, you can sell.  

After  BTC -1.49%  hit the 0.618 retrace the first time, the price dropped from $9735 to $8650. but quickly bounced back to the 0.618 retrace level. That was a second & better opportunity to sell. Not only did  BTC -1.49%  form a  double top  on the larger time frame, but also with a  bearish  divergence on the 4hr time frame. Accordingly, you have more reasons to sell.  

Note #3 (Set take profit)  
Same as the rules of “Double top”, there are some variations as to which price level should you take profits. Personally, I would stick to the below:  
1)	First, take profit when risk/reward ratio hits 1:1 (recommend to take 30% - 50% profits and adjust the SL of the remaining positions to break-even)  
2)	When price hits the same price level as the low after the neckline is broken ((b) point in this example)  
3)	When price hits 1.272 fib extension of (a)(b)  
4)	When price hits point (d) (using  AB=CD  pattern. If you are not sure what the rules of  AB=CD  are, you can refer to my previous TA in which I have attached the link below)  
5)	If in a one-way market (heavily bearish/bullish), you can always keep 10% to 20% of your positions and take profits when risk/reward ratio hits 1:5 or even 1:10

 BTC -1.49%  is on the verge of breaking to a daily higher high on the bounce if the bulls can see a push this morning. 
If we reject from here the daily will form a lower high and we will see a tightening pattern within the highlighted  support and resistance  lines.  
Important for the bulls to show up or we could stay in this range into tomorrow.  
Healthy consolidation after the most recent bull move and the 15 min chart needs to change the trend.  
Also look to  EMA  12 support on the 4 hour and hourly.  
Another morning like yesterday with the bulls comfortable as worst case, we likely stay in the tightening pattern if bulls cannot prove themselves.

The current situation of  Bitcoin -1.48%  is quite difficult. We are on a clear treshold. A lot of traders are saying that we are on a clear downtrend, but the same amount of people are claiming that we will have our reversal soon. 

This article tries to sum up all important information you have to need! 

1: Retracement of a parabolic uptrend: 
There is a rule of thumb for the retracement of a parabolic uptrend. We should retrace to approx. the 0.786  Fibonacci Retracement  +/- 10%! 
Depending where we start the count, we are already in that target. Although both ways (blue and red) have still some space for a further downwave! 







2: The bloody support of Bitcoin: 
The average cost of mining one  bitcoin -1.48%  are at USA/Russia approx. 4700$ and at 3100$ for china! 
A drop below a target of 4700$ would be savage. Nevertheless, i can't image that we will hit that target. 







3: Manipulation of  Bitcoin -1.48%  and the Bart Simpson Pattern: 
A friend of mine found some unusual patterns in the orderbooks of several exchanges: 
https://twitter.com/CryptoSyndrome 
Altcoins are manipulated on a daily basis. It seems that  bitcoin -1.48%  is now affected to this too, which causes all these 3-5% pump and dumps. 
Thus, we are forming all the time the Bartin Simpsons Patterns. 

4: Similarity to 2014: 
Bitcoin -1.48%  now: 






Bitcoin -1.48%  2014: 







5: Deminishing downtrend and a strong support 
If we see the falling  wedges  as the force of the downtrend, then the force is diminishing! 
Furthermore we have strong support which is holding now for the 4th time! 







6: The Indicators 
Having a look at the indicators at 2D, we have a good potential for an upwave now. 
The  volume  is deminishing which should indicate a breakout soon. 
The  MACD  is about to cross, the  RSI  was slightly overbought and is heading up like the  Stoch .  RSI . 
The 200  EMA  is slighty under the current price and act as a support. 

7: The symetrical Triangle 
The theory says, that we should have in a  sym -1.72% . triangle 5 times an  ABC  wave. The waves are not perfect, but we can construct them. 






As you can see, the last four ABC-Waves formed always a 1:1 extention, which indicates that we have finished wave 5. 

8: A possible Head and Shoulders 
Even if this is not the most perfect  Head and Shoulders  Pattern, it's still valid! 
We are currently at the neckline, which is a strong and important resistance. Breaking upwards should indicate a good uptrend. 







9: The magic  6th 0.00%  of the month 






Suprisingly we have on every  6th 0.00%  of the month a reversal. Why is that??? 
One reason could be the  CME Group Futures  with dates for the settlements always nearby the  6th 0.00%  of the month! 
http://www.cmegroup.com 

10: Longterm  Bullish  TA 
The whole pattern could be seen as a big  bullish pennant . 







11: Shortterm  Bullish  TA 
Leading diagonal  starting wave1 of an  Elliott Wave , since we have now an impulse wave, after the 5x  ABC  pattern inside the triangle is finished. 
Our target should be at the top of the triangle nearby 8600-8800$. 







12: Longterm  Bearish  TA 
We also can argue, that we are currenty in an downtrend and the  sym -1.72% . triangle just continuing the trend. 
Our target should be nearby 6000$ which is also a finished downwards  Elliott Wave .

Nothing is happening in the market:  volatility  has become extinct and coins' trading fallen out of fashion. Range-bound bots and robotic humans absolutely prosper in this environment. The price was unable to break the 7700 threshold. For me this is a  bearish  signal. Indicators provide mixed signals, so let's examine wave structure. The move from May 29 is a  3-wave              correction within a larger downtrend. A price drop below 7500 would confirm this scenario.

Comment:
					Impulse Wave Truncation (Truncated Fifth) - 
Truncated 5th wave is when the market has become so over-extended in Wave 3 that there is not much force left for the impulse wave to come to a proper completion. So when this happens, there is a chance that the last wave of the impulse, Wave 5, will not reach the end of Wave 3 before the market starts correcting in the opposite direction. At this point, the market is just too exhausted. This condition is often called a “failure” or a “Truncation.”

I can see many people still believe that we are going inside a  descending triangle . I also believed this in my idea that i shard on may 1st: 



 

Things can change so quickly and if we didn't adapt to the changes then someone will. That's why i believe that we have to be in fast adapt mode in this market. Doesn't mean that you need to change without checking yourself. I try to find 2-3 confirmations before i change my idea on something. This includes pattern changes, trend changes etc 

There are 21 corrective wave patterns in EW which is categorized into major 3 corrective wave patterns: 

Zigzag  (5-3-5) 
Flat (3-3-5) 
Triangle (3-3-3-3-3) 

And other patterns are combinations of the above which is:  

Double three (A combination of two corrective patterns above) 
Triple three (A combination of three corrective patterns above) 

So what i can see now is that we are in two double three combination corrective wave pattern: 








More info here:  

https://elliottwave-forecast.com/elliott-wave-theory/#corrective-waves 

Confirmations: 

1. Wave ((i)) of C is 1.6k and ((v)) is going to be completed below the triangle 
2. Wave (E) of the triangle can't go beyond the triangle.  
3. This has happened twice before in 2013 & 2015 

Each wave  got 3 subwaves (a,b &c) inside and we are in the subwave c of ((y)) of Y which is an impulsive wave. 

Impulsive waves: 1,3,5,a,c 
Corrective waves: 2,4,b 

Normal Fibo Ratios for these waves are: 

wave 2 = 0.5 - 0.8 of wave 1  
wave 3 = 1.236 - 1.618 of wave 1  
wave 4 = 0.5 - 0.618 of wave 3  
wave 5 = 0.618 - 1 of wave 1  
wave B = 0.5 - 0.8 of wave A  
wave C = 0.618 - 1.236 of wave A  

Now if you check what happened in subwave a of ((y)) of Y you can see that: 

Wave (i) of a: 985$ 
Wave (ii) of a: 434$  
Wave ( iii -0.45% ) of a: 1207$  
Wave (iv) of a: 691$ [~0.618 of Wave ( iii -0.45% )] 
Wave (v) of a: 950$  








I have seen  BTC -1.51%  impulsive waves fibo ratios almost the same as the previous impulsive wave fibo ratios. 
Now if you apply the same for the last wave C of (E) this is what you get: 

Wave ((i)) of c: 1587$ 
Wave ((ii)) of c  = 793$ 
Wave (( iii -0.45% )) of c  = 1961$ 
Wave ((iv)) of c [~0.618 of Wave (( iii -0.45% ))] = 1212$ 
Wave ((v)) of c  = 1587$ 








Also note that Wave ((iv)) might not retrace upto 0.618 of Wave (( iii -0.45% )) as everyone will be in panic mode by that time so minimum retracement would be around 0.386 of Wave (( iii -0.45% )) which is around 756$ and this is why i can see it goes down to 5k level or little bit more towards 4.7k which is the lowest level of the  support zone  (orange dotted lines) 








So 3 Possible Support lines for reversal would be 

1. Blue: 5800 - 6100 (Only possible if Wave ((v)) is truncated) 
2. Orange: 4700 - 5000 (This is most likely where we heading)  
3. Red: 4100 - 4400 (Only possible if Wave (( iii -0.45% )) is extended)

 Bitcoin -1.48%  has recently developed an interesting pattern of completing a  bullish  and  bearish  cycle on the sixth of every month in an alternating order. As we can see in the chart above, a fall is followed by a rise. This has happened twice before and is expected to happen again now on the  6th 0.00%  of June, 2018. This time  Bitcoin -1.48%  will finish a  bearish  cycle and I expected to begin the next  bullish  cycle at least till the end of  6th 0.00%  of July, 2018. 

This pattern of rise and fall is also supported by other patterns on the chart that signal a  bullish  reversal. The support line has also held firmly and if this pattern of alternating rise and fall ensues,  Bitcoin -1.48%  could very well make new highs by the end of the year. The  RSI  is recovering from oversold levels and has now approached a normal.  Bitcoin -1.48%  is currently at a favorable point for  bullish  entries. The price broke a long term resistance as it break past the downtrend line in April, 2018. This was a big accomplishment for the bulls but the lack of confidence pulled the price back to the support line. Currently, the price is just above the support line and appears to be all set for a  bullish  comeback but the reality is, there are not enough bulls in the market. 

The past few months have been devastating for the price of  Bitcoin -1.48%  ( BTC -1.48% ) and a lot of investors are still running scared. Institutional investors are looking for more clarity regarding regulations concerning cryptocurrencies and also safer ways to invest and store their coins. As for retail investors, most of them comprise of first time investors who have never traded any financial asset before. So, when they saw that  Bitcoin -1.48%  ( BTC -1.48% ) is making 20% gains every day, they thought this could go on forever and jumped with both feet, only to find the carpet pulled under from their feet. Big investors have always played small investors as cannon fodder and have gotten away with their schemes even in regulated markets like forex or the stock market. Cryptocurrencies is a new market with no proper regulations which means it is natural to expect that those who can afford to not play by the rules, most likely won’t.

Hello friends,  

It's been a while since my last post; lack of time and an urge to do more research has mainly driven me to take a break from posting ideas on TradingView. I am still in the process of doing more research and study, but I figure posting once in a while couldn't hurt. 

Since I have become recently very convinced about this, I am outlining a very possible situation with  Bitcoin              where the  trend line  we have been on since early October breaks, reaching around a temporary low of $5000. This is examined on the  daily chart , since this is one of the best charts to examine trends of this size. I have to first and foremost say that I am not trying to spread fear, I know many people do not like to hear  bearish  ideas, but  technical analysis  is ultimately a rational exercise, and I feel that possibilities with very strong signs should be explored. 

There are a few things to look at, but I first want to talk about the big picture with, long-term  support and resistance  lines. I think most people can agree that there was a very significant downtrending resistance line that began from the peak of the  ATH              in late December, to the low of around $6400 (thick red line). After the break from that line, it seems we moved into a sideways trend, bouncing back and forth between an emerging downtrending resistance line (light red) and a support line that we seem to have been respecting since mid-October (light green); at least this appears to be the case with the lows, where the angle's effectiveness appears very strongly. Finally, based on previous bounces, we can establish a support of around $5000-$5300 (I've thus created a small  support zone  around that range, in dark green), as well as lower supports around $3200 and $2000 (though I do not believe these will be reached, in dark green).   

Now, onto the analysis - it's no secret that  Bitcoin              has been squeezing in, ready for a significant move either upwards or downwards. Initially I considered the upwards move to be more likely due to the significant media attention cryptocurrency has been receiving, but after viewing previous market cycles of  Bitcoin              (check 2013), it seems clear to me that the  bearish  scenario of closing in on the market cycle is very likely, and should at the very least be prepared for with proper risk management. According to Dow Theory, which is said to have laid the foundations of modern  technical analysis , history repeats itself, and this is a situation where we forced to consider this. 

Should we break from the line, we will likely fall straight down to the $5000-$5000 area, where we will shoot back up and bounce towards around $6700 or so (maybe a little less). From there one, we will likely enter a sideways trend, which we will continue until we see higher highs and higher lows and parabolic movement returns, which could lead to us challenging the all-time high, and hitting $35k-$50k. 

NOTE: I seem to have reached the max character limit for this section of the idea, so I will continue my text below.

Comment:
					Onto the short-term: 


Scenario A: 

The reason why I have drawn this movement into a pennant is this way, is simply because we have been moving through this ascending triangle for quite a while now (May 23rd to today). I don't think that the pattern will be sufficient to directly lead into a strong sell-off, but we should consider that the size of ascending triangle suggests a small movement downwards at the very least, which can create a higher low, and thus move into position into a bearish pennant. Why would a bearish pennant occur here and not have a bounce to $8500-$8700? The reason is in positioning - the huge downtrend (May 5th to May 26th) creates a very nice flagpole in which it hits around the $5000 area very perfectly, and thus I would not be surprised if this happens. 

Second reason: on the Stoch RSI indicator on the daily chart, it appears to be dangerously high, which would suggest it being oversold. For the most part, it seems to have called lows and highs, at least to some extent. This overdrawn movement may very well have increased the likelyhood of Bitcoin being oversold. This could suggest that this is the last step into a sharp downturn, but this does not preclude Situation B. Volume has also been steadily decreasing, but this is the case with any sort of consolidation, I believe. 

Finally, the lines I have drawn below the triangle are simply bounces that I think seem fairly reasonable. The length from to support to the lines correlate with the length of the flagpole, of course, though it may seem chopped off due to the huge line from the long-term support downwards. 


Scenario B: 

This is much simpler, Bitcoin hits the upper resistance line, bounces off, challenges the lower support line, and we potentially see a break, and the rest unfolds from there. 


----------------------------------------------------------------------- 


With all this being said, do not fear if you are hoping for more parabolic movement - this likely will not be the end, and will simply be the set up for a long, drawn out sideways movement until the first signs of bullish activity begin and we start all over again. If you are longing around here, please consider using risk management, prepare for every possibility. If you are shorting, the same applies. 

Please trade with care. I wish the best to all traders!

Comment:
					This really is a very minor note, but I just want to emphasize that the rising wedge (which I erroneously refer to as an ascending triangle, a bad habit I have) entering a bearish pennant is more based on intuition than anything. Also, this pennant is mainly based on the conservative assumption that the break will happen at 7900, if it happens at 7700 where we seem to be general resistance, the pennant would look something like this:

I am Mid term-bullish on  BTC -1.48%  going into the end of this week, but looking to get into the market on a pull back to occur before I get in to the market.  The jury is still out as to whether this weekly bear trend is ready to turn around.  

We can see that both the  RSI  and  MFI  are both  Bullish  on the daily having bottomed when reaching oversold on both at c. $7k support where we found our longer term  trend line . 

We are currently in the process of meeting the Tenkan (blue line) as I write this, so in the very short term, I am looking for a pull back to $7550 range for an entry.  One of the main reasons for this is that on the 4hour timeframes we are close to completing an edge to edge trade so the risk reward doesn’t fit my profile, however a break out from the cloud or above the Tenkan around $7777 will make me enter the market. 

The  RSI  and  MFI  have both been excellent indicators in this bear market.  Whenever  RSI  has gone above the 60 and the  MFI  80; its time to exit the market from a  bullish  trade and consider shorting as it progresses higher.   

Based on the  RSI ,  MFI  trends and the fact that we will run into the Kijun at just around $8-8.2k, I will be scalling out at this  bearish  confluence level to start looking for pull backs and reassessment as i believe it to be a key point as  

Best case scenario this trade would yield a 10% return before leverage. 
This is for illustrative purposes only, please DYOR and goodluck with your trading.

So the pullback trade that we were looking at worked out & has made it's way back to the neckline level of structure. We are now at what i like to call a ""decision point"" Essentially IF price is able to violate this current level od structure THEN we're likely to continue to our next price projection.  

Something that a lot of newer traders don't understand is that when it comes to bigger moves, the market will often provide multiple opportunities to get involved. For those who don't rush and for those who don't get discouraged. If you perform consistent analysis you can often find multiple ways to involve yourself in a trade even if you missed the first strike.

This is the way markets move, If you question my charting check my previous posts. Its as simple as pie. We are going down, How long and how far is too soon to say. Here is a chart that we can understand the future price action and where to buy back. Before you guys start blasting my comment section with the time and how it may not be right thats correct. I am not calculating the time I'm just making a technical drawing of the directions that we will see in the next few months.  

Recent price action has clear signs of wash trading / market manipulation fud and lots of nonsense. Its hard to prove almost impossible so as a trader we just need to deal with it. Ideally the situation you are supposed to trade are critical break up and break down points to enter the trade. Dont enter or exit dumb trades and lose money. As an experienced trader you should be looking for shorts, I would not consider a long unless we are over $10-12k

I am never good with words so instead of writing paragraphs of clarification to justify my call for SHORT since my last posting, I have explained everything on my chart with the least words possible using Fibonacci. It does not matter how popular  Bitcoin -1.49%  has become, or how deep it has disrupted the financial sector, or how many institutional investors have come to invest in it -- the psychology behind a market cycle does not change. 

I don't really encourage anyone to short  Bitcoin -1.49% , but in all honesty, don't expect the bulls to fly anytime soon. Like I said before, this correction that we are having right now is the ""MOTHER OF ALL CORRECTIONS"" after a 4-year-long bull cycle since the 2013 correction... and we are just halfway through.

My best idea ever, taking some time off the last 2 days :) The whales just continue to play their little games by squeezing leveraged short and long positions out of the market. Can't play them, it's just too easy. Maybe it's time we retail traders stand together, combine our  volume  and use their own game against them. Yeah, maybe we could even make a blockbuster movie about this :) I love me some science fiction :) LOL  

My last update of the previous analysis i showed 2 important support levels where the price could bounce up from. The first support around 7350 did the trick and the price got pushed back to 7700. From that point on i told my members that i thought i was seeing distribution, but it was still very confusing to figure out what was going on. TA was showing  bullish  signs, that  bull flag  was very strong and was even turning slowly up and was about to squeeze upwards. But of course out of no where the price got dumped, the move we saw a few hours ago. After that 200 point drop the price got pushed up again to 7700 like that dump was a glitch. If your a whale, why not push out leveraged traders and take your money while your accumulating or distributing. It's like a bonus, like the cherry on top :)  

Anyway, in this chart we can see allot of similarities of what is going on. As you know i have been saying i am still  bearish  for the medium term, but i just could not say what was going to happen on the short term. 2 days ago after we finally dropped out of that  wedge , i said we would have 2 options.  
- Break those 2 support levels from the last update of my previous chart (73xx and 71xx) 
- Make a higher low at those same support levels and make another move up above the high.  
 
As we can see in the chart, the  fractal  is not 100% identical so it's no guarantee that the 7700 high we just saw is the high already and that we start to move down. But based on this  fractal , i don't want to see the price get above the 7800/7900. This  fractal  confirms my  bearish  view as well. That's why TA is so great, you can turn any chart to fit your view :). 

Even without this  fractal , i just give it a very small chance that 7K price action is the fundament of a low to start another bull rally, i just highly doubt that. I want to see more  volume  to begin with and at least  double bottom  kind of formation. So the minimum i expect is a test of the 7100/6900in the coming week or 2. But the movement i have in mind for the med term is a drop below the 7K to form a big V shape low. If we get to see that, than i might even become  bullish  for the rest of the year :).  

As long as the price stays above the 73xx, we have to assume the bulls are still in control and we should see another wave up. So for me the 73xx is an important turning point.

					At the moment it looks like bulls are trying to push higher, this bull flag/triangle is still very strong. So no sign of weakness yet! First small sign would be a drop below 7620/7600. Bulls need to break 7700

					This is my bigger picture, think this bearish triangle is still 100% in play. I think if bulls can't break the 7800/7900 the bearish version is probably going to happen. Can't say HOW it will go, this blue line is just a guess. But a big V shape low would be the most bullish for the long term. I still think we are seeing distribution here. The only way this idea can be countered, is through a big increase of buying volume, if that doesn't happen, i think it's only a matter of time.

					What a surprise, nothing has changed :) 

The price took a small dump but the volume was low so no real read on what the intent was. So we might see another move up, if we start to see a small pump that takes out the 7800, be aware of a fake breakout. The blue line is a possibility of what the move could look like IF we move up and if the breakout fails. If that happens than we will probably get confirmation if the price breaks the 7600ish. If we break the 7800 it should stay above the 7700 to confirm another move up. Not much more to say about what's going on.

Comment:
					So we have made a small drop, but there is no volume confirming it, not yet at least. First small support has been broken, but not yet very meaningful because of the low volume. For the ones who shorted it, just be aware of another squeeze up, since this small move downwards looks a bit to controlled.  

Pure TA, it broke the channel and retested the former support as resistance now.

703,1528359434.0,Taiwan_Bear,2618 (Double top & 0.618 pull-back) - do not miss it!!,"
In the last couple of TAs I have mentioned the “2618 pattern” and have been asked what 2618 means. Sorry for taking it so long as it took me quite a while to put everything altogether. But, as promised, I have explained below the rules and trade setups for the 2618 pattern.  

What are the rules/setups/steps for 2618?  
1.	Form a  double top  (Note #1)  
2.	Neckline has to be broken  
3.	After price found support at point (b), wait for pull back to 0.618 fib retracement of (a)(b)  
4.	After price retraced to 0.618, look for confluence and sell (eg. Structures,  trendlines  ,  double top  on a lower time frame,  rsi  divergence,  bearish pin bar  ,  inside bar  break down etc.) (Note #2)  
5.	Stop loss to be set above  double top 
6.	Set Take Profit levels (Note #3)  

Note #1 ( Double top ):  
The first step for the formation of 2618 is to form a  double top  at key resistance levels. Why at key resistance levels? Because we want to avoid fake double tops which can occur occasionally.  

There are some variations between various resources (books, websites) regarding the definitions of “double top”. The main differences occur where:  
a)	Some said for a  double top  to be valid, the wick of the 2nd top cannot exceed the wick of the 1st top; whereas, others said:  
b)	The wick of the 2nd top can exceed the wick of the 1st top but the candle close of the 2nd top CANNOT exceed the wick of the 1st top; or  
c)	The wick of the 2nd top can exceed the wick of the 1st top and the candle close of the 2nd top CAN exceed the wick of the 1st top; or  
d)	The wick of the 2nd top meets at least the candle close of the 1st top; or  
e)	The body of the 2nd top cannot exceed the body of the 1st top  

Personally, I would say all the above definitions work just fine although I do prefer definition a) because it means that the selling pressure is strong and the bulls fail to make a higher high. When there is a higher high formed in a downtrend, it can mean the downtrend has reversed and therefore you might not want to sell when the price pulls back to the 0.618 fib retracement.  

Note #2 ( 0.618 retracement ):  
When the price pulls back to 0.618, it does not mean to sell straight away. There must be more than one reason to sell other than the 0.618 retrace. The more reasons the better. In this example, you can see there are certainly structures (key resistance levels) at the 0.618 retrace. As well, there was a  double top  formed on the lower time frame. Consequently, you can sell.  

After  BTC -1.49%  hit the 0.618 retrace the first time, the price dropped from $9735 to $8650. but quickly bounced back to the 0.618 retrace level. That was a second & better opportunity to sell. Not only did  BTC -1.49%  form a  double top  on the larger time frame, but also with a  bearish  divergence on the 4hr time frame. Accordingly, you have more reasons to sell.  

Note #3 (Set take profit)  
Same as the rules of “Double top”, there are some variations as to which price level should you take profits. Personally, I would stick to the below:  
1)	First, take profit when risk/reward ratio hits 1:1 (recommend to take 30% - 50% profits and adjust the SL of the remaining positions to break-even)  
2)	When price hits the same price level as the low after the neckline is broken ((b) point in this example)  
3)	When price hits 1.272 fib extension of (a)(b)  
4)	When price hits point (d) (using  AB=CD  pattern. If you are not sure what the rules of  AB=CD  are, you can refer to my previous TA in which I have attached the link below)  
5)	If in a one-way market (heavily bearish/bullish), you can always keep 10% to 20% of your positions and take profits when risk/reward ratio hits 1:5 or even 1:10

 BTC -1.51%  is on the verge of breaking to a daily higher high on the bounce if the bulls can see a push this morning. 
If we reject from here the daily will form a lower high and we will see a tightening pattern within the highlighted  support and resistance  lines.  
Important for the bulls to show up or we could stay in this range into tomorrow.  
Healthy consolidation after the most recent bull move and the 15 min chart needs to change the trend.  
Also look to  EMA  12 support on the 4 hour and hourly.  
Another morning like yesterday with the bulls comfortable as worst case, we likely stay in the tightening pattern if bulls cannot prove themselves.

The current situation of  Bitcoin -1.51%  is quite difficult. We are on a clear treshold. A lot of traders are saying that we are on a clear downtrend, but the same amount of people are claiming that we will have our reversal soon. 

This article tries to sum up all important information you have to need! 

1: Retracement of a parabolic uptrend: 
There is a rule of thumb for the retracement of a parabolic uptrend. We should retrace to approx. the 0.786  Fibonacci Retracement  +/- 10%! 
Depending where we start the count, we are already in that target. Although both ways (blue and red) have still some space for a further downwave! 







2: The bloody support of Bitcoin: 
The average cost of mining one  bitcoin -1.51%  are at USA/Russia approx. 4700$ and at 3100$ for china! 
A drop below a target of 4700$ would be savage. Nevertheless, i can't image that we will hit that target. 







3: Manipulation of  Bitcoin -1.51%  and the Bart Simpson Pattern: 
A friend of mine found some unusual patterns in the orderbooks of several exchanges: 
https://twitter.com/CryptoSyndrome 
Altcoins are manipulated on a daily basis. It seems that  bitcoin -1.51%  is now affected to this too, which causes all these 3-5% pump and dumps. 
Thus, we are forming all the time the Bartin Simpsons Patterns. 

4: Similarity to 2014: 
Bitcoin -1.51%  now: 






Bitcoin -1.51%  2014: 







5: Deminishing downtrend and a strong support 
If we see the falling  wedges  as the force of the downtrend, then the force is diminishing! 
Furthermore we have strong support which is holding now for the 4th time! 







6: The Indicators 
Having a look at the indicators at 2D, we have a good potential for an upwave now. 
The  volume  is deminishing which should indicate a breakout soon. 
The  MACD  is about to cross, the  RSI  was slightly overbought and is heading up like the  Stoch .  RSI . 
The 200  EMA  is slighty under the current price and act as a support. 

7: The symetrical Triangle 
The theory says, that we should have in a  sym -1.72% . triangle 5 times an  ABC  wave. The waves are not perfect, but we can construct them. 






As you can see, the last four ABC-Waves formed always a 1:1 extention, which indicates that we have finished wave 5. 

8: A possible Head and Shoulders 
Even if this is not the most perfect  Head and Shoulders  Pattern, it's still valid! 
We are currently at the neckline, which is a strong and important resistance. Breaking upwards should indicate a good uptrend. 







9: The magic  6th 0.00%  of the month 






Suprisingly we have on every  6th 0.00%  of the month a reversal. Why is that??? 
One reason could be the  CME Group Futures  with dates for the settlements always nearby the  6th 0.00%  of the month!

11: Shortterm  Bullish  TA 
Leading diagonal  starting wave1 of an  Elliott Wave , since we have now an impulse wave, after the 5x  ABC  pattern inside the triangle is finished. 
Our target should be at the top of the triangle nearby 8600-8800$. 







12: Longterm  Bearish  TA 
We also can argue, that we are currenty in an downtrend and the  sym -1.72% . triangle just continuing the trend. 
Our target should be nearby 6000$ which is also a finished downwards  Elliott Wave .

Nothing is happening in the market:  volatility  has become extinct and coins' trading fallen out of fashion. Range-bound bots and robotic humans absolutely prosper in this environment. The price was unable to break the 7700 threshold. For me this is a  bearish  signal. Indicators provide mixed signals, so let's examine wave structure. The move from May 29 is a  3-wave              correction within a larger downtrend. A price drop below 7500 would confirm this scenario.

					Impulse Wave Truncation (Truncated Fifth) - 
Truncated 5th wave is when the market has become so over-extended in Wave 3 that there is not much force left for the impulse wave to come to a proper completion. So when this happens, there is a chance that the last wave of the impulse, Wave 5, will not reach the end of Wave 3 before the market starts correcting in the opposite direction. At this point, the market is just too exhausted. This condition is often called a “failure” or a “Truncation.”

I can see many people still believe that we are going inside a  descending triangle . I also believed this in my idea that i shard on may 1st: 



 

Things can change so quickly and if we didn't adapt to the changes then someone will. That's why i believe that we have to be in fast adapt mode in this market. Doesn't mean that you need to change without checking yourself. I try to find 2-3 confirmations before i change my idea on something. This includes pattern changes, trend changes etc 

There are 21 corrective wave patterns in EW which is categorized into major 3 corrective wave patterns: 

Zigzag  (5-3-5) 
Flat (3-3-5) 
Triangle (3-3-3-3-3) 

And other patterns are combinations of the above which is:  

Double three (A combination of two corrective patterns above) 
Triple three (A combination of three corrective patterns above) 

So what i can see now is that we are in two double three combination corrective wave pattern: 








More info here:  

https://elliottwave-forecast.com/elliott-wave-theory/#corrective-waves 

Confirmations: 

1. Wave ((i)) of C is 1.6k and ((v)) is going to be completed below the triangle 
2. Wave (E) of the triangle can't go beyond the triangle.  
3. This has happened twice before in 2013 & 2015 

Each wave  got 3 subwaves (a,b &c) inside and we are in the subwave c of ((y)) of Y which is an impulsive wave. 

Impulsive waves: 1,3,5,a,c 
Corrective waves: 2,4,b 

Normal Fibo Ratios for these waves are: 

wave 2 = 0.5 - 0.8 of wave 1  
wave 3 = 1.236 - 1.618 of wave 1  
wave 4 = 0.5 - 0.618 of wave 3  
wave 5 = 0.618 - 1 of wave 1  
wave B = 0.5 - 0.8 of wave A  
wave C = 0.618 - 1.236 of wave A  

Now if you check what happened in subwave a of ((y)) of Y you can see that: 

Wave (i) of a: 985$ 
Wave (ii) of a: 434$  
Wave ( iii             ) of a: 1207$  
Wave (iv) of a: 691$ [~0.618 of Wave ( iii             )] 
Wave (v) of a: 950$  








I have seen  BTC -1.51%  impulsive waves fibo ratios almost the same as the previous impulsive wave fibo ratios. 
Now if you apply the same for the last wave C of (E) this is what you get: 

Wave ((i)) of c: 1587$ 
Wave ((ii)) of c  = 793$ 
Wave (( iii             )) of c  = 1961$ 
Wave ((iv)) of c [~0.618 of Wave (( iii             ))] = 1212$ 
Wave ((v)) of c  = 1587$ 








Also note that Wave ((iv)) might not retrace upto 0.618 of Wave (( iii             )) as everyone will be in panic mode by that time so minimum retracement would be around 0.386 of Wave (( iii             )) which is around 756$ and this is why i can see it goes down to 5k level or little bit more towards 4.7k which is the lowest level of the  support zone  (orange dotted lines) 








So 3 Possible Support lines for reversal would be 

1. Blue: 5800 - 6100 (Only possible if Wave ((v)) is truncated) 
2. Orange: 4700 - 5000 (This is most likely where we heading)  
3. Red: 4100 - 4400 (Only possible if Wave (( iii             )) is extended)

 Bitcoin -1.51%  has recently developed an interesting pattern of completing a  bullish  and  bearish  cycle on the sixth of every month in an alternating order. As we can see in the chart above, a fall is followed by a rise. This has happened twice before and is expected to happen again now on the  6th 0.00%  of June, 2018. This time  Bitcoin -1.51%  will finish a  bearish  cycle and I expected to begin the next  bullish  cycle at least till the end of  6th 0.00%  of July, 2018. 

This pattern of rise and fall is also supported by other patterns on the chart that signal a  bullish  reversal. The support line has also held firmly and if this pattern of alternating rise and fall ensues,  Bitcoin -1.51%  could very well make new highs by the end of the year. The  RSI  is recovering from oversold levels and has now approached a normal.  Bitcoin -1.51%  is currently at a favorable point for  bullish  entries. The price broke a long term resistance as it break past the downtrend line in April, 2018. This was a big accomplishment for the bulls but the lack of confidence pulled the price back to the support line. Currently, the price is just above the support line and appears to be all set for a  bullish  comeback but the reality is, there are not enough bulls in the market. 

The past few months have been devastating for the price of  Bitcoin -1.51%  ( BTC -1.51% ) and a lot of investors are still running scared. Institutional investors are looking for more clarity regarding regulations concerning cryptocurrencies and also safer ways to invest and store their coins. As for retail investors, most of them comprise of first time investors who have never traded any financial asset before. So, when they saw that  Bitcoin -1.51%  ( BTC -1.51% ) is making 20% gains every day, they thought this could go on forever and jumped with both feet, only to find the carpet pulled under from their feet. Big investors have always played small investors as cannon fodder and have gotten away with their schemes even in regulated markets like forex or the stock market. Cryptocurrencies is a new market with no proper regulations which means it is natural to expect that those who can afford to not play by the rules, most likely won’t.

Hello friends,  

It's been a while since my last post; lack of time and an urge to do more research has mainly driven me to take a break from posting ideas on TradingView. I am still in the process of doing more research and study, but I figure posting once in a while couldn't hurt. 

Since I have become recently very convinced about this, I am outlining a very possible situation with  Bitcoin -1.51%  where the  trend line  we have been on since early October breaks, reaching around a temporary low of $5000. This is examined on the  daily chart , since this is one of the best charts to examine trends of this size. I have to first and foremost say that I am not trying to spread fear, I know many people do not like to hear  bearish  ideas, but  technical analysis  is ultimately a rational exercise, and I feel that possibilities with very strong signs should be explored. 

There are a few things to look at, but I first want to talk about the big picture with, long-term  support and resistance  lines. I think most people can agree that there was a very significant downtrending resistance line that began from the peak of the  ATH 0.63%  in late December, to the low of around $6400 (thick red line). After the break from that line, it seems we moved into a sideways trend, bouncing back and forth between an emerging downtrending resistance line (light red) and a support line that we seem to have been respecting since mid-October (light green); at least this appears to be the case with the lows, where the angle's effectiveness appears very strongly. Finally, based on previous bounces, we can establish a support of around $5000-$5300 (I've thus created a small  support zone  around that range, in dark green), as well as lower supports around $3200 and $2000 (though I do not believe these will be reached, in dark green).   

Now, onto the analysis - it's no secret that  Bitcoin -1.51%  has been squeezing in, ready for a significant move either upwards or downwards. Initially I considered the upwards move to be more likely due to the significant media attention cryptocurrency has been receiving, but after viewing previous market cycles of  Bitcoin -1.51%  (check 2013), it seems clear to me that the  bearish  scenario of closing in on the market cycle is very likely, and should at the very least be prepared for with proper risk management. According to Dow Theory, which is said to have laid the foundations of modern  technical analysis , history repeats itself, and this is a situation where we forced to consider this. 

Should we break from the line, we will likely fall straight down to the $5000-$5000 area, where we will shoot back up and bounce towards around $6700 or so (maybe a little less). From there one, we will likely enter a sideways trend, which we will continue until we see higher highs and higher lows and parabolic movement returns, which could lead to us challenging the all-time high, and hitting $35k-$50k. 

NOTE: I seem to have reached the max character limit for this section of the idea, so I will continue my text below.

Comment:
					Onto the short-term: 


Scenario A: 

The reason why I have drawn this movement into a pennant is this way, is simply because we have been moving through this ascending triangle for quite a while now (May 23rd to today). I don't think that the pattern will be sufficient to directly lead into a strong sell-off, but we should consider that the size of ascending triangle suggests a small movement downwards at the very least, which can create a higher low, and thus move into position into a bearish pennant. Why would a bearish pennant occur here and not have a bounce to $8500-$8700? The reason is in positioning - the huge downtrend (May 5th to May 26th) creates a very nice flagpole in which it hits around the $5000 area very perfectly, and thus I would not be surprised if this happens. 

Second reason: on the Stoch RSI indicator on the daily chart, it appears to be dangerously high, which would suggest it being oversold. For the most part, it seems to have called lows and highs, at least to some extent. This overdrawn movement may very well have increased the likelyhood of Bitcoin being oversold. This could suggest that this is the last step into a sharp downturn, but this does not preclude Situation B. Volume has also been steadily decreasing, but this is the case with any sort of consolidation, I believe. 

Finally, the lines I have drawn below the triangle are simply bounces that I think seem fairly reasonable. The length from to support to the lines correlate with the length of the flagpole, of course, though it may seem chopped off due to the huge line from the long-term support downwards. 


Scenario B: 

This is much simpler, Bitcoin hits the upper resistance line, bounces off, challenges the lower support line, and we potentially see a break, and the rest unfolds from there. 


----------------------------------------------------------------------- 


With all this being said, do not fear if you are hoping for more parabolic movement - this likely will not be the end, and will simply be the set up for a long, drawn out sideways movement until the first signs of bullish activity begin and we start all over again. If you are longing around here, please consider using risk management, prepare for every possibility. If you are shorting, the same applies. 

Please trade with care. I wish the best to all traders!

Comment:
					This really is a very minor note, but I just want to emphasize that the rising wedge (which I erroneously refer to as an ascending triangle, a bad habit I have) entering a bearish pennant is more based on intuition than anything. Also, this pennant is mainly based on the conservative assumption that the break will happen at 7900, if it happens at 7700 where we seem to be general resistance, the pennant would look something like this:

Jun 7




I am Mid term-bullish on  BTC -1.51%  going into the end of this week, but looking to get into the market on a pull back to occur before I get in to the market.  The jury is still out as to whether this weekly bear trend is ready to turn around.  

We can see that both the  RSI  and  MFI  are both  Bullish  on the daily having bottomed when reaching oversold on both at c. $7k support where we found our longer term  trend line . 

We are currently in the process of meeting the Tenkan (blue line) as I write this, so in the very short term, I am looking for a pull back to $7550 range for an entry.  One of the main reasons for this is that on the 4hour timeframes we are close to completing an edge to edge trade so the risk reward doesn’t fit my profile, however a break out from the cloud or above the Tenkan around $7777 will make me enter the market. 

The  RSI  and  MFI  have both been excellent indicators in this bear market.  Whenever  RSI  has gone above the 60 and the  MFI  80; its time to exit the market from a  bullish  trade and consider shorting as it progresses higher.   

Based on the  RSI ,  MFI  trends and the fact that we will run into the Kijun at just around $8-8.2k, I will be scalling out at this  bearish  confluence level to start looking for pull backs and reassessment as i believe it to be a key point as  

Best case scenario this trade would yield a 10% return before leverage. 
This is for illustrative purposes only, please DYOR and goodluck with your trading.

So the pullback trade that we were looking at worked out & has made it's way back to the neckline level of structure. We are now at what i like to call a ""decision point"" Essentially IF price is able to violate this current level od structure THEN we're likely to continue to our next price projection.  

Something that a lot of newer traders don't understand is that when it comes to bigger moves, the market will often provide multiple opportunities to get involved. For those who don't rush and for those who don't get discouraged. If you perform consistent analysis you can often find multiple ways to involve yourself in a trade even if you missed the first strike.

Recent price action has clear signs of wash trading / market manipulation fud and lots of nonsense. Its hard to prove almost impossible so as a trader we just need to deal with it. Ideally the situation you are supposed to trade are critical break up and break down points to enter the trade. Dont enter or exit dumb trades and lose money.

My best idea ever, taking some time off the last 2 days :) The whales just continue to play their little games by squeezing leveraged short and long positions out of the market. Can't play them, it's just too easy. Maybe it's time we retail traders stand together, combine our  volume  and use their own game against them. Yeah, maybe we could even make a blockbuster movie about this :) I love me some science fiction :) LOL  

My last update of the previous analysis i showed 2 important support levels where the price could bounce up from. The first support around 7350 did the trick and the price got pushed back to 7700. From that point on i told my members that i thought i was seeing distribution, but it was still very confusing to figure out what was going on. TA was showing  bullish  signs, that  bull flag  was very strong and was even turning slowly up and was about to squeeze upwards. But of course out of no where the price got dumped, the move we saw a few hours ago. After that 200 point drop the price got pushed up again to 7700 like that dump was a glitch. If your a whale, why not push out leveraged traders and take your money while your accumulating or distributing. It's like a bonus, like the cherry on top :)  

Anyway, in this chart we can see allot of similarities of what is going on. As you know i have been saying i am still  bearish  for the medium term, but i just could not say what was going to happen on the short term. 2 days ago after we finally dropped out of that  wedge , i said we would have 2 options.  
- Break those 2 support levels from the last update of my previous chart (73xx and 71xx) 
- Make a higher low at those same support levels and make another move up above the high.  
 
As we can see in the chart, the  fractal  is not 100% identical so it's no guarantee that the 7700 high we just saw is the high already and that we start to move down. But based on this  fractal , i don't want to see the price get above the 7800/7900. This  fractal  confirms my  bearish  view as well. That's why TA is so great, you can turn any chart to fit your view :). 

Even without this  fractal , i just give it a very small chance that 7K price action is the fundament of a low to start another bull rally, i just highly doubt that. I want to see more  volume  to begin with and at least  double bottom  kind of formation. So the minimum i expect is a test of the 7100/6900in the coming week or 2. But the movement i have in mind for the med term is a drop below the 7K to form a big V shape low. If we get to see that, than i might even become  bullish  for the rest of the year :).  

As long as the price stays above the 73xx, we have to assume the bulls are still in control and we should see another wave up. So for me the 73xx is an important turning point.

					At the moment it looks like bulls are trying to push higher, this bull flag/triangle is still very strong. So no sign of weakness yet! First small sign would be a drop below 7620/7600. Bulls need to break 7700

					This is my bigger picture, think this bearish triangle is still 100% in play. I think if bulls can't break the 7800/7900 the bearish version is probably going to happen. Can't say HOW it will go, this blue line is just a guess. But a big V shape low would be the most bullish for the long term. I still think we are seeing distribution here. The only way this idea can be countered, is through a big increase of buying volume, if that doesn't happen, i think it's only a matter of time.

					Lower time frame we can see a new upwards channel and maybe even a rising wedge. From the looks of it, it's slowly going down to test the support line again. Depending on what will happen there we can make a better prediction for the rest of the day.

Comment:
					What a surprise, nothing has changed :) 

The price took a small dump but the volume was low so no real read on what the intent was. So we might see another move up, if we start to see a small pump that takes out the 7800, be aware of a fake breakout. The blue line is a possibility of what the move could look like IF we move up and if the breakout fails. If that happens than we will probably get confirmation if the price breaks the 7600ish. If we break the 7800 it should stay above the 7700 to confirm another move up. Not much more to say about what's going on.

Comment:
					So we have made a small drop, but there is no volume confirming it, not yet at least. First small support has been broken, but not yet very meaningful because of the low volume. For the ones who shorted it, just be aware of another squeeze up, since this small move downwards looks a bit to controlled.  

Pure TA, it broke the channel and retested the former support as resistance now.

721,1528359434.0,Taiwan_Bear,2618 (Double top & 0.618 pull-back) - do not miss it!!,"
In the last couple of TAs I have mentioned the “2618 pattern” and have been asked what 2618 means. Sorry for taking it so long as it took me quite a while to put everything altogether. But, as promised, I have explained below the rules and trade setups for the 2618 pattern.  

What are the rules/setups/steps for 2618?  
1.	Form a  double top  (Note #1)  
2.	Neckline has to be broken  
3.	After price found support at point (b), wait for pull back to 0.618 fib retracement of (a)(b)  
4.	After price retraced to 0.618, look for confluence and sell (eg. Structures,  trendlines  ,  double top  on a lower time frame,  rsi  divergence,  bearish pin bar  ,  inside bar  break down etc.) (Note #2)  
5.	Stop loss to be set above  double top 
6.	Set Take Profit levels (Note #3)  

Note #1 ( Double top ):  
The first step for the formation of 2618 is to form a  double top  at key resistance levels. Why at key resistance levels? Because we want to avoid fake double tops which can occur occasionally.  

There are some variations between various resources (books, websites) regarding the definitions of “double top”. The main differences occur where:  
a)	Some said for a  double top  to be valid, the wick of the 2nd top cannot exceed the wick of the 1st top; whereas, others said:  
b)	The wick of the 2nd top can exceed the wick of the 1st top but the candle close of the 2nd top CANNOT exceed the wick of the 1st top; or  
c)	The wick of the 2nd top can exceed the wick of the 1st top and the candle close of the 2nd top CAN exceed the wick of the 1st top; or  
d)	The wick of the 2nd top meets at least the candle close of the 1st top; or  
e)	The body of the 2nd top cannot exceed the body of the 1st top  

Personally, I would say all the above definitions work just fine although I do prefer definition a) because it means that the selling pressure is strong and the bulls fail to make a higher high. When there is a higher high formed in a downtrend, it can mean the downtrend has reversed and therefore you might not want to sell when the price pulls back to the 0.618 fib retracement.  

Note #2 ( 0.618 retracement ):  
When the price pulls back to 0.618, it does not mean to sell straight away. There must be more than one reason to sell other than the 0.618 retrace. The more reasons the better. In this example, you can see there are certainly structures (key resistance levels) at the 0.618 retrace. As well, there was a  double top  formed on the lower time frame. Consequently, you can sell.  

After  BTC -1.52%  hit the 0.618 retrace the first time, the price dropped from $9735 to $8650. but quickly bounced back to the 0.618 retrace level. That was a second & better opportunity to sell. Not only did  BTC -1.52%  form a  double top  on the larger time frame, but also with a  bearish  divergence on the 4hr time frame. Accordingly, you have more reasons to sell.  

Note #3 (Set take profit)  
Same as the rules of “Double top”, there are some variations as to which price level should you take profits. Personally, I would stick to the below:  
1)	First, take profit when risk/reward ratio hits 1:1 (recommend to take 30% - 50% profits and adjust the SL of the remaining positions to break-even)  
2)	When price hits the same price level as the low after the neckline is broken ((b) point in this example)  
3)	When price hits 1.272 fib extension of (a)(b)  
4)	When price hits point (d) (using  AB=CD  pattern. If you are not sure what the rules of  AB=CD  are, you can refer to my previous TA in which I have attached the link below)  
5)	If in a one-way market (heavily bearish/bullish), you can always keep 10% to 20% of your positions and take profits when risk/reward ratio hits 1:5 or even 1:10

 BTC -1.55%  is on the verge of breaking to a daily higher high on the bounce if the bulls can see a push this morning. 
If we reject from here the daily will form a lower high and we will see a tightening pattern within the highlighted  support and resistance  lines.  
Important for the bulls to show up or we could stay in this range into tomorrow.  
Healthy consolidation after the most recent bull move and the 15 min chart needs to change the trend.  
Also look to  EMA  12 support on the 4 hour and hourly.  
Another morning like yesterday with the bulls comfortable as worst case, we likely stay in the tightening pattern if bulls cannot prove themselves.

The current situation of  Bitcoin -1.57%  is quite difficult. We are on a clear treshold. A lot of traders are saying that we are on a clear downtrend, but the same amount of people are claiming that we will have our reversal soon. 

This article tries to sum up all important information you have to need! 

1: Retracement of a parabolic uptrend: 
There is a rule of thumb for the retracement of a parabolic uptrend. We should retrace to approx. the 0.786  Fibonacci Retracement  +/- 10%! 
Depending where we start the count, we are already in that target. Although both ways (blue and red) have still some space for a further downwave! 







2: The bloody support of Bitcoin: 
The average cost of mining one  bitcoin -1.57%  are at USA/Russia approx. 4700$ and at 3100$ for china! 
A drop below a target of 4700$ would be savage. Nevertheless, i can't image that we will hit that target. 







3: Manipulation of  Bitcoin -1.57%  and the Bart Simpson Pattern: 
A friend of mine found some unusual patterns in the orderbooks of several exchanges: 
https://twitter.com/CryptoSyndrome 
Altcoins are manipulated on a daily basis. It seems that  bitcoin -1.57%  is now affected to this too, which causes all these 3-5% pump and dumps. 
Thus, we are forming all the time the Bartin Simpsons Patterns. 

4: Similarity to 2014: 
Bitcoin -1.57%  now: 






Bitcoin -1.57%  2014: 







5: Deminishing downtrend and a strong support 
If we see the falling  wedges  as the force of the downtrend, then the force is diminishing! 
Furthermore we have strong support which is holding now for the 4th time! 







6: The Indicators 
Having a look at the indicators at 2D, we have a good potential for an upwave now. 
The  volume  is deminishing which should indicate a breakout soon. 
The  MACD  is about to cross, the  RSI  was slightly overbought and is heading up like the  Stoch .  RSI . 
The 200  EMA  is slighty under the current price and act as a support. 

7: The symetrical Triangle 
The theory says, that we should have in a  sym -1.72% . triangle 5 times an  ABC  wave. The waves are not perfect, but we can construct them. 






As you can see, the last four ABC-Waves formed always a 1:1 extention, which indicates that we have finished wave 5. 

8: A possible Head and Shoulders 
Even if this is not the most perfect  Head and Shoulders  Pattern, it's still valid! 
We are currently at the neckline, which is a strong and important resistance. Breaking upwards should indicate a good uptrend. 







9: The magic  6th 0.00%  of the month 






Suprisingly we have on every  6th 0.00%  of the month a reversal. Why is that??? 
One reason could be the  CME Group Futures  with dates for the settlements always nearby the  6th 0.00%  of the month! 
http://www.cmegroup.com 

10: Longterm  Bullish  TA 
The whole pattern could be seen as a big  bullish pennant . 







11: Shortterm  Bullish  TA 
Leading diagonal  starting wave1 of an  Elliott Wave , since we have now an impulse wave, after the 5x  ABC  pattern inside the triangle is finished. 
Our target should be at the top of the triangle nearby 8600-8800$. 







12: Longterm  Bearish  TA 
We also can argue, that we are currenty in an downtrend and the  sym -1.72% . triangle just continuing the trend. 
Our target should be nearby 6000$ which is also a finished downwards  Elliott Wave .

Nothing is happening in the market:  volatility  has become extinct and coins' trading fallen out of fashion. Range-bound bots and robotic humans absolutely prosper in this environment. The price was unable to break the 7700 threshold. For me this is a  bearish  signal. Indicators provide mixed signals, so let's examine wave structure. The move from May 29 is a  3-wave -0.12%  correction within a larger downtrend. A price drop below 7500 would confirm this scenario.

Comment:
					Impulse Wave Truncation (Truncated Fifth) - 
Truncated 5th wave is when the market has become so over-extended in Wave 3 that there is not much force left for the impulse wave to come to a proper completion. So when this happens, there is a chance that the last wave of the impulse, Wave 5, will not reach the end of Wave 3 before the market starts correcting in the opposite direction. At this point, the market is just too exhausted. This condition is often called a “failure” or a “Truncation.”

I can see many people still believe that we are going inside a  descending triangle . I also believed this in my idea that i shard on may 1st: 



 

Things can change so quickly and if we didn't adapt to the changes then someone will. That's why i believe that we have to be in fast adapt mode in this market. Doesn't mean that you need to change without checking yourself. I try to find 2-3 confirmations before i change my idea on something. This includes pattern changes, trend changes etc 

There are 21 corrective wave patterns in EW which is categorized into major 3 corrective wave patterns: 

Zigzag  (5-3-5) 
Flat (3-3-5) 
Triangle (3-3-3-3-3) 

And other patterns are combinations of the above which is:  

Double three (A combination of two corrective patterns above) 
Triple three (A combination of three corrective patterns above) 

So what i can see now is that we are in two double three combination corrective wave pattern: 








More info here:  

https://elliottwave-forecast.com/elliott-wave-theory/#corrective-waves 

Confirmations: 

1. Wave ((i)) of C is 1.6k and ((v)) is going to be completed below the triangle 
2. Wave (E) of the triangle can't go beyond the triangle.  
3. This has happened twice before in 2013 & 2015 

Each wave  got 3 subwaves (a,b &c) inside and we are in the subwave c of ((y)) of Y which is an impulsive wave. 

Impulsive waves: 1,3,5,a,c 
Corrective waves: 2,4,b 

Normal Fibo Ratios for these waves are: 

wave 2 = 0.5 - 0.8 of wave 1  
wave 3 = 1.236 - 1.618 of wave 1  
wave 4 = 0.5 - 0.618 of wave 3  
wave 5 = 0.618 - 1 of wave 1  
wave B = 0.5 - 0.8 of wave A  
wave C = 0.618 - 1.236 of wave A  

Now if you check what happened in subwave a of ((y)) of Y you can see that: 

Wave (i) of a: 985$ 
Wave (ii) of a: 434$  
Wave ( iii             ) of a: 1207$  
Wave (iv) of a: 691$ [~0.618 of Wave ( iii             )] 
Wave (v) of a: 950$  








I have seen  BTC              impulsive waves fibo ratios almost the same as the previous impulsive wave fibo ratios. 
Now if you apply the same for the last wave C of (E) this is what you get: 

Wave ((i)) of c: 1587$ 
Wave ((ii)) of c  = 793$ 
Wave (( iii             )) of c  = 1961$ 
Wave ((iv)) of c [~0.618 of Wave (( iii             ))] = 1212$ 
Wave ((v)) of c  = 1587$ 








Also note that Wave ((iv)) might not retrace upto 0.618 of Wave (( iii             )) as everyone will be in panic mode by that time so minimum retracement would be around 0.386 of Wave (( iii             )) which is around 756$ and this is why i can see it goes down to 5k level or little bit more towards 4.7k which is the lowest level of the  support zone  (orange dotted lines) 








So 3 Possible Support lines for reversal would be 

1. Blue: 5800 - 6100 (Only possible if Wave ((v)) is truncated) 
2. Orange: 4700 - 5000 (This is most likely where we heading)  
3. Red: 4100 - 4400 (Only possible if Wave (( iii             )) is extended)

 Bitcoin -1.59%  has recently developed an interesting pattern of completing a  bullish  and  bearish  cycle on the sixth of every month in an alternating order. As we can see in the chart above, a fall is followed by a rise. This has happened twice before and is expected to happen again now on the  6th 0.00%  of June, 2018. This time  Bitcoin -1.59%  will finish a  bearish  cycle and I expected to begin the next  bullish  cycle at least till the end of  6th 0.00%  of July, 2018. 

This pattern of rise and fall is also supported by other patterns on the chart that signal a  bullish  reversal. The support line has also held firmly and if this pattern of alternating rise and fall ensues,  Bitcoin -1.59%  could very well make new highs by the end of the year. The  RSI  is recovering from oversold levels and has now approached a normal.  Bitcoin -1.59%  is currently at a favorable point for  bullish  entries. The price broke a long term resistance as it break past the downtrend line in April, 2018. This was a big accomplishment for the bulls but the lack of confidence pulled the price back to the support line. Currently, the price is just above the support line and appears to be all set for a  bullish  comeback but the reality is, there are not enough bulls in the market. 

The past few months have been devastating for the price of  Bitcoin -1.59%  ( BTC -1.59% ) and a lot of investors are still running scared. Institutional investors are looking for more clarity regarding regulations concerning cryptocurrencies and also safer ways to invest and store their coins. As for retail investors, most of them comprise of first time investors who have never traded any financial asset before. So, when they saw that  Bitcoin -1.59%  ( BTC -1.59% ) is making 20% gains every day, they thought this could go on forever and jumped with both feet, only to find the carpet pulled under from their feet. Big investors have always played small investors as cannon fodder and have gotten away with their schemes even in regulated markets like forex or the stock market. Cryptocurrencies is a new market with no proper regulations which means it is natural to expect that those who can afford to not play by the rules, most likely won’t.

Hello friends,  

It's been a while since my last post; lack of time and an urge to do more research has mainly driven me to take a break from posting ideas on TradingView. I am still in the process of doing more research and study, but I figure posting once in a while couldn't hurt. 

Since I have become recently very convinced about this, I am outlining a very possible situation with  Bitcoin -1.69%  where the  trend line  we have been on since early October breaks, reaching around a temporary low of $5000. This is examined on the  daily chart , since this is one of the best charts to examine trends of this size. I have to first and foremost say that I am not trying to spread fear, I know many people do not like to hear  bearish  ideas, but  technical analysis  is ultimately a rational exercise, and I feel that possibilities with very strong signs should be explored. 

There are a few things to look at, but I first want to talk about the big picture with, long-term  support and resistance  lines. I think most people can agree that there was a very significant downtrending resistance line that began from the peak of the  ATH 0.63%  in late December, to the low of around $6400 (thick red line). After the break from that line, it seems we moved into a sideways trend, bouncing back and forth between an emerging downtrending resistance line (light red) and a support line that we seem to have been respecting since mid-October (light green); at least this appears to be the case with the lows, where the angle's effectiveness appears very strongly. Finally, based on previous bounces, we can establish a support of around $5000-$5300 (I've thus created a small  support zone  around that range, in dark green), as well as lower supports around $3200 and $2000 (though I do not believe these will be reached, in dark green).   

Now, onto the analysis - it's no secret that  Bitcoin -1.69%  has been squeezing in, ready for a significant move either upwards or downwards. Initially I considered the upwards move to be more likely due to the significant media attention cryptocurrency has been receiving, but after viewing previous market cycles of  Bitcoin -1.69%  (check 2013), it seems clear to me that the  bearish  scenario of closing in on the market cycle is very likely, and should at the very least be prepared for with proper risk management. According to Dow Theory, which is said to have laid the foundations of modern  technical analysis , history repeats itself, and this is a situation where we forced to consider this. 

Should we break from the line, we will likely fall straight down to the $5000-$5000 area, where we will shoot back up and bounce towards around $6700 or so (maybe a little less). From there one, we will likely enter a sideways trend, which we will continue until we see higher highs and higher lows and parabolic movement returns, which could lead to us challenging the all-time high, and hitting $35k-$50k. 

NOTE: I seem to have reached the max character limit for this section of the idea, so I will continue my text below.

Comment:
					Onto the short-term: 


Scenario A: 

The reason why I have drawn this movement into a pennant is this way, is simply because we have been moving through this ascending triangle for quite a while now (May 23rd to today). I don't think that the pattern will be sufficient to directly lead into a strong sell-off, but we should consider that the size of ascending triangle suggests a small movement downwards at the very least, which can create a higher low, and thus move into position into a bearish pennant. Why would a bearish pennant occur here and not have a bounce to $8500-$8700? The reason is in positioning - the huge downtrend (May 5th to May 26th) creates a very nice flagpole in which it hits around the $5000 area very perfectly, and thus I would not be surprised if this happens. 

Second reason: on the Stoch RSI indicator on the daily chart, it appears to be dangerously high, which would suggest it being oversold. For the most part, it seems to have called lows and highs, at least to some extent. This overdrawn movement may very well have increased the likelyhood of Bitcoin being oversold. This could suggest that this is the last step into a sharp downturn, but this does not preclude Situation B. Volume has also been steadily decreasing, but this is the case with any sort of consolidation, I believe. 

Finally, the lines I have drawn below the triangle are simply bounces that I think seem fairly reasonable. The length from to support to the lines correlate with the length of the flagpole, of course, though it may seem chopped off due to the huge line from the long-term support downwards. 


Scenario B: 

This is much simpler, Bitcoin hits the upper resistance line, bounces off, challenges the lower support line, and we potentially see a break, and the rest unfolds from there. 


----------------------------------------------------------------------- 


With all this being said, do not fear if you are hoping for more parabolic movement - this likely will not be the end, and will simply be the set up for a long, drawn out sideways movement until the first signs of bullish activity begin and we start all over again. If you are longing around here, please consider using risk management, prepare for every possibility. If you are shorting, the same applies. 

Please trade with care. I wish the best to all traders!

Comment:
					This really is a very minor note, but I just want to emphasize that the rising wedge (which I erroneously refer to as an ascending triangle, a bad habit I have) entering a bearish pennant is more based on intuition than anything. Also, this pennant is mainly based on the conservative assumption that the break will happen at 7900, if it happens at 7700 where we seem to be general resistance, the pennant would look something like this:

We can see that both the  RSI  and  MFI  are both  Bullish  on the daily having bottomed when reaching oversold on both at c. $7k support where we found our longer term  trend line . 

We are currently in the process of meeting the Tenkan (blue line) as I write this, so in the very short term, I am looking for a pull back to $7550 range for an entry.  One of the main reasons for this is that on the 4hour timeframes we are close to completing an edge to edge trade so the risk reward doesn’t fit my profile, however a break out from the cloud or above the Tenkan around $7777 will make me enter the market. 

The  RSI  and  MFI  have both been excellent indicators in this bear market.  Whenever  RSI  has gone above the 60 and the  MFI  80; its time to exit the market from a  bullish  trade and consider shorting as it progresses higher.   

Based on the  RSI ,  MFI  trends and the fact that we will run into the Kijun at just around $8-8.2k, I will be scalling out at this  bearish  confluence level to start looking for pull backs and reassessment as i believe it to be a key point as  

Best case scenario this trade would yield a 10% return before leverage. 
This is for illustrative purposes only, please DYOR and goodluck with your trading.

So the pullback trade that we were looking at worked out & has made it's way back to the neckline level of structure. We are now at what i like to call a ""decision point"" Essentially IF price is able to violate this current level od structure THEN we're likely to continue to our next price projection.  

Something that a lot of newer traders don't understand is that when it comes to bigger moves, the market will often provide multiple opportunities to get involved. For those who don't rush and for those who don't get discouraged. If you perform consistent analysis you can often find multiple ways to involve yourself in a trade even if you missed the first strike.

This is the way markets move, If you question my charting check my previous posts. Its as simple as pie. We are going down, How long and how far is too soon to say. Here is a chart that we can understand the future price action and where to buy back. Before you guys start blasting my comment section with the time and how it may not be right thats correct. I am not calculating the time I'm just making a technical drawing of the directions that we will see in the next few months.  

Recent price action has clear signs of wash trading / market manipulation fud and lots of nonsense. Its hard to prove almost impossible so as a trader we just need to deal with it. Ideally the situation you are supposed to trade are critical break up and break down points to enter the trade. Dont enter or exit dumb trades and lose money. As an experienced trader you should be looking for shorts, I would not consider a long unless we are over $10-12k

I am never good with words so instead of writing paragraphs of clarification to justify my call for SHORT since my last posting, I have explained everything on my chart with the least words possible using Fibonacci. It does not matter how popular  Bitcoin -1.70%  has become, or how deep it has disrupted the financial sector, or how many institutional investors have come to invest in it -- the psychology behind a market cycle does not change. 

I don't really encourage anyone to short  Bitcoin -1.70% , but in all honesty, don't expect the bulls to fly anytime soon. Like I said before, this correction that we are having right now is the ""MOTHER OF ALL CORRECTIONS"" after a 4-year-long bull cycle since the 2013 correction... and we are just halfway through.

My best idea ever, taking some time off the last 2 days :) The whales just continue to play their little games by squeezing leveraged short and long positions out of the market. Can't play them, it's just too easy. Maybe it's time we retail traders stand together, combine our  volume  and use their own game against them. Yeah, maybe we could even make a blockbuster movie about this :) I love me some science fiction :) LOL  

My last update of the previous analysis i showed 2 important support levels where the price could bounce up from. The first support around 7350 did the trick and the price got pushed back to 7700. From that point on i told my members that i thought i was seeing distribution, but it was still very confusing to figure out what was going on. TA was showing  bullish  signs, that  bull flag  was very strong and was even turning slowly up and was about to squeeze upwards. But of course out of no where the price got dumped, the move we saw a few hours ago. After that 200 point drop the price got pushed up again to 7700 like that dump was a glitch. If your a whale, why not push out leveraged traders and take your money while your accumulating or distributing. It's like a bonus, like the cherry on top :)  

Anyway, in this chart we can see allot of similarities of what is going on. As you know i have been saying i am still  bearish  for the medium term, but i just could not say what was going to happen on the short term. 2 days ago after we finally dropped out of that  wedge , i said we would have 2 options.  
- Break those 2 support levels from the last update of my previous chart (73xx and 71xx) 
- Make a higher low at those same support levels and make another move up above the high.  
 
As we can see in the chart, the  fractal  is not 100% identical so it's no guarantee that the 7700 high we just saw is the high already and that we start to move down. But based on this  fractal , i don't want to see the price get above the 7800/7900. This  fractal  confirms my  bearish  view as well. That's why TA is so great, you can turn any chart to fit your view :). 

Even without this  fractal , i just give it a very small chance that 7K price action is the fundament of a low to start another bull rally, i just highly doubt that. I want to see more  volume  to begin with and at least  double bottom  kind of formation. So the minimum i expect is a test of the 7100/6900in the coming week or 2. But the movement i have in mind for the med term is a drop below the 7K to form a big V shape low. If we get to see that, than i might even become  bullish  for the rest of the year :).  

As long as the price stays above the 73xx, we have to assume the bulls are still in control and we should see another wave up. So for me the 73xx is an important turning point.

Comment:
					At the moment it looks like bulls are trying to push higher, this bull flag/triangle is still very strong. So no sign of weakness yet! First small sign would be a drop below 7620/7600. Bulls need to break 7700

Comment:
					This is my bigger picture, think this bearish triangle is still 100% in play. I think if bulls can't break the 7800/7900 the bearish version is probably going to happen. Can't say HOW it will go, this blue line is just a guess. But a big V shape low would be the most bullish for the long term. I still think we are seeing distribution here. The only way this idea can be countered, is through a big increase of buying volume, if that doesn't happen, i think it's only a matter of time.

					Lower time frame we can see a new upwards channel and maybe even a rising wedge. From the looks of it, it's slowly going down to test the support line again. Depending on what will happen there we can make a better prediction for the rest of the day.

Comment:
					What a surprise, nothing has changed :) 

The price took a small dump but the volume was low so no real read on what the intent was. So we might see another move up, if we start to see a small pump that takes out the 7800, be aware of a fake breakout. The blue line is a possibility of what the move could look like IF we move up and if the breakout fails. If that happens than we will probably get confirmation if the price breaks the 7600ish. If we break the 7800 it should stay above the 7700 to confirm another move up. Not much more to say about what's going on.

Comment:
					So we have made a small drop, but there is no volume confirming it, not yet at least. First small support has been broken, but not yet very meaningful because of the low volume. For the ones who shorted it, just be aware of another squeeze up, since this small move downwards looks a bit to controlled.  

Pure TA, it broke the channel and retested the former support as resistance now.

739,1528359434.0,Taiwan_Bear,2618 (Double top & 0.618 pull-back) - do not miss it!!,"
In the last couple of TAs I have mentioned the “2618 pattern” and have been asked what 2618 means. Sorry for taking it so long as it took me quite a while to put everything altogether. But, as promised, I have explained below the rules and trade setups for the 2618 pattern.  

What are the rules/setups/steps for 2618?  
1.	Form a  double top  (Note #1)  
2.	Neckline has to be broken  
3.	After price found support at point (b), wait for pull back to 0.618 fib retracement of (a)(b)  
4.	After price retraced to 0.618, look for confluence and sell (eg. Structures,  trendlines  ,  double top  on a lower time frame,  rsi  divergence,  bearish pin bar  ,  inside bar  break down etc.) (Note #2)  
5.	Stop loss to be set above  double top 
6.	Set Take Profit levels (Note #3)  

Note #1 ( Double top ):  
The first step for the formation of 2618 is to form a  double top  at key resistance levels. Why at key resistance levels? Because we want to avoid fake double tops which can occur occasionally.  

There are some variations between various resources (books, websites) regarding the definitions of “double top”. The main differences occur where:  
a)	Some said for a  double top  to be valid, the wick of the 2nd top cannot exceed the wick of the 1st top; whereas, others said:  
b)	The wick of the 2nd top can exceed the wick of the 1st top but the candle close of the 2nd top CANNOT exceed the wick of the 1st top; or  
c)	The wick of the 2nd top can exceed the wick of the 1st top and the candle close of the 2nd top CAN exceed the wick of the 1st top; or  
d)	The wick of the 2nd top meets at least the candle close of the 1st top; or  
e)	The body of the 2nd top cannot exceed the body of the 1st top  

Personally, I would say all the above definitions work just fine although I do prefer definition a) because it means that the selling pressure is strong and the bulls fail to make a higher high. When there is a higher high formed in a downtrend, it can mean the downtrend has reversed and therefore you might not want to sell when the price pulls back to the 0.618 fib retracement.  

Note #2 ( 0.618 retracement ):  
When the price pulls back to 0.618, it does not mean to sell straight away. There must be more than one reason to sell other than the 0.618 retrace. The more reasons the better. In this example, you can see there are certainly structures (key resistance levels) at the 0.618 retrace. As well, there was a  double top  formed on the lower time frame. Consequently, you can sell.  

After  BTC              hit the 0.618 retrace the first time, the price dropped from $9735 to $8650. but quickly bounced back to the 0.618 retrace level. That was a second & better opportunity to sell. Not only did  BTC              form a  double top  on the larger time frame, but also with a  bearish  divergence on the 4hr time frame. Accordingly, you have more reasons to sell.  

Note #3 (Set take profit)  
Same as the rules of “Double top”, there are some variations as to which price level should you take profits. Personally, I would stick to the below:  
1)	First, take profit when risk/reward ratio hits 1:1 (recommend to take 30% - 50% profits and adjust the SL of the remaining positions to break-even)  
2)	When price hits the same price level as the low after the neckline is broken ((b) point in this example)  
3)	When price hits 1.272 fib extension of (a)(b)  
4)	When price hits point (d) (using  AB=CD  pattern. If you are not sure what the rules of  AB=CD  are, you can refer to my previous TA in which I have attached the link below)  
5)	If in a one-way market (heavily bearish/bullish), you can always keep 10% to 20% of your positions and take profits when risk/reward ratio hits 1:5 or even 1:10

 BTC -1.70%  is on the verge of breaking to a daily higher high on the bounce if the bulls can see a push this morning. 
If we reject from here the daily will form a lower high and we will see a tightening pattern within the highlighted  support and resistance  lines.  
Important for the bulls to show up or we could stay in this range into tomorrow.  
Healthy consolidation after the most recent bull move and the 15 min chart needs to change the trend.  
Also look to  EMA  12 support on the 4 hour and hourly.  
Another morning like yesterday with the bulls comfortable as worst case, we likely stay in the tightening pattern if bulls cannot prove themselves.

The current situation of  Bitcoin -1.70%  is quite difficult. We are on a clear treshold. A lot of traders are saying that we are on a clear downtrend, but the same amount of people are claiming that we will have our reversal soon. 

This article tries to sum up all important information you have to need! 

1: Retracement of a parabolic uptrend: 
There is a rule of thumb for the retracement of a parabolic uptrend. We should retrace to approx. the 0.786  Fibonacci Retracement  +/- 10%! 
Depending where we start the count, we are already in that target. Although both ways (blue and red) have still some space for a further downwave! 







2: The bloody support of Bitcoin: 
The average cost of mining one  bitcoin -1.70%  are at USA/Russia approx. 4700$ and at 3100$ for china! 
A drop below a target of 4700$ would be savage. Nevertheless, i can't image that we will hit that target. 







3: Manipulation of  Bitcoin -1.70%  and the Bart Simpson Pattern: 
A friend of mine found some unusual patterns in the orderbooks of several exchanges: 
https://twitter.com/CryptoSyndrome 
Altcoins are manipulated on a daily basis. It seems that  bitcoin -1.70%  is now affected to this too, which causes all these 3-5% pump and dumps. 
Thus, we are forming all the time the Bartin Simpsons Patterns. 

4: Similarity to 2014: 
Bitcoin -1.70%  now: 






Bitcoin -1.70%  2014: 







5: Deminishing downtrend and a strong support 
If we see the falling  wedges  as the force of the downtrend, then the force is diminishing! 
Furthermore we have strong support which is holding now for the 4th time! 







6: The Indicators 
Having a look at the indicators at 2D, we have a good potential for an upwave now. 
The  volume  is deminishing which should indicate a breakout soon. 
The  MACD  is about to cross, the  RSI  was slightly overbought and is heading up like the  Stoch .  RSI . 
The 200  EMA  is slighty under the current price and act as a support. 

7: The symetrical Triangle 
The theory says, that we should have in a  sym -0.93% . triangle 5 times an  ABC  wave. The waves are not perfect, but we can construct them. 






As you can see, the last four ABC-Waves formed always a 1:1 extention, which indicates that we have finished wave 5. 

8: A possible Head and Shoulders 
Even if this is not the most perfect  Head and Shoulders  Pattern, it's still valid! 
We are currently at the neckline, which is a strong and important resistance. Breaking upwards should indicate a good uptrend. 







9: The magic  6th 0.00%  of the month 






Suprisingly we have on every  6th 0.00%  of the month a reversal. Why is that??? 
One reason could be the  CME Group Futures  with dates for the settlements always nearby the  6th 0.00%  of the month! 
http://www.cmegroup.com 

10: Longterm  Bullish  TA 
The whole pattern could be seen as a big  bullish pennant . 







11: Shortterm  Bullish  TA 
Leading diagonal  starting wave1 of an  Elliott Wave , since we have now an impulse wave, after the 5x  ABC  pattern inside the triangle is finished. 
Our target should be at the top of the triangle nearby 8600-8800$. 







12: Longterm  Bearish  TA 
We also can argue, that we are currenty in an downtrend and the  sym -0.93% . triangle just continuing the trend. 
Our target should be nearby 6000$ which is also a finished downwards  Elliott Wave .

Nothing is happening in the market:  volatility  has become extinct and coins' trading fallen out of fashion. Range-bound bots and robotic humans absolutely prosper in this environment. The price was unable to break the 7700 threshold. For me this is a  bearish  signal. Indicators provide mixed signals, so let's examine wave structure. The move from May 29 is a  3-wave -0.12%  correction within a larger downtrend. A price drop below 7500 would confirm this scenario.

Comment:
					Impulse Wave Truncation (Truncated Fifth) - 
Truncated 5th wave is when the market has become so over-extended in Wave 3 that there is not much force left for the impulse wave to come to a proper completion. So when this happens, there is a chance that the last wave of the impulse, Wave 5, will not reach the end of Wave 3 before the market starts correcting in the opposite direction. At this point, the market is just too exhausted. This condition is often called a “failure” or a “Truncation.”

I can see many people still believe that we are going inside a  descending triangle . I also believed this in my idea that i shard on may 1st: 



 

Things can change so quickly and if we didn't adapt to the changes then someone will. That's why i believe that we have to be in fast adapt mode in this market. Doesn't mean that you need to change without checking yourself. I try to find 2-3 confirmations before i change my idea on something. This includes pattern changes, trend changes etc 

There are 21 corrective wave patterns in EW which is categorized into major 3 corrective wave patterns: 

Zigzag  (5-3-5) 
Flat (3-3-5) 
Triangle (3-3-3-3-3) 

And other patterns are combinations of the above which is:  

Double three (A combination of two corrective patterns above) 
Triple three (A combination of three corrective patterns above) 

So what i can see now is that we are in two double three combination corrective wave pattern: 








More info here:  

https://elliottwave-forecast.com/elliott-wave-theory/#corrective-waves 

Confirmations: 

1. Wave ((i)) of C is 1.6k and ((v)) is going to be completed below the triangle 
2. Wave (E) of the triangle can't go beyond the triangle.  
3. This has happened twice before in 2013 & 2015 

Each wave  got 3 subwaves (a,b &c) inside and we are in the subwave c of ((y)) of Y which is an impulsive wave. 

Impulsive waves: 1,3,5,a,c 
Corrective waves: 2,4,b 

Normal Fibo Ratios for these waves are: 

wave 2 = 0.5 - 0.8 of wave 1  
wave 3 = 1.236 - 1.618 of wave 1  
wave 4 = 0.5 - 0.618 of wave 3  
wave 5 = 0.618 - 1 of wave 1  
wave B = 0.5 - 0.8 of wave A  
wave C = 0.618 - 1.236 of wave A  

Now if you check what happened in subwave a of ((y)) of Y you can see that: 

Wave (i) of a: 985$ 
Wave (ii) of a: 434$  
Wave ( iii -0.47% ) of a: 1207$  
Wave (iv) of a: 691$ [~0.618 of Wave ( iii -0.47% )] 
Wave (v) of a: 950$  








I have seen  BTC -1.70%  impulsive waves fibo ratios almost the same as the previous impulsive wave fibo ratios. 
Now if you apply the same for the last wave C of (E) this is what you get: 

Wave ((i)) of c: 1587$ 
Wave ((ii)) of c  = 793$ 
Wave (( iii -0.47% )) of c  = 1961$ 
Wave ((iv)) of c [~0.618 of Wave (( iii -0.47% ))] = 1212$ 
Wave ((v)) of c  = 1587$ 








Also note that Wave ((iv)) might not retrace upto 0.618 of Wave (( iii -0.47% )) as everyone will be in panic mode by that time so minimum retracement would be around 0.386 of Wave (( iii -0.47% )) which is around 756$ and this is why i can see it goes down to 5k level or little bit more towards 4.7k which is the lowest level of the  support zone  (orange dotted lines) 








So 3 Possible Support lines for reversal would be

 Bitcoin              has recently developed an interesting pattern of completing a  bullish  and  bearish  cycle on the sixth of every month in an alternating order. As we can see in the chart above, a fall is followed by a rise. This has happened twice before and is expected to happen again now on the  6th              of June, 2018. This time  Bitcoin              will finish a  bearish  cycle and I expected to begin the next  bullish  cycle at least till the end of  6th              of July, 2018. 

This pattern of rise and fall is also supported by other patterns on the chart that signal a  bullish  reversal. The support line has also held firmly and if this pattern of alternating rise and fall ensues,  Bitcoin              could very well make new highs by the end of the year. The  RSI  is recovering from oversold levels and has now approached a normal.  Bitcoin              is currently at a favorable point for  bullish  entries. The price broke a long term resistance as it break past the downtrend line in April, 2018. This was a big accomplishment for the bulls but the lack of confidence pulled the price back to the support line. Currently, the price is just above the support line and appears to be all set for a  bullish  comeback but the reality is, there are not enough bulls in the market. 

The past few months have been devastating for the price of  Bitcoin              ( BTC             ) and a lot of investors are still running scared. Institutional investors are looking for more clarity regarding regulations concerning cryptocurrencies and also safer ways to invest and store their coins. As for retail investors, most of them comprise of first time investors who have never traded any financial asset before. So, when they saw that  Bitcoin              ( BTC             ) is making 20% gains every day, they thought this could go on forever and jumped with both feet, only to find the carpet pulled under from their feet. Big investors have always played small investors as cannon fodder and have gotten away with their schemes even in regulated markets like forex or the stock market. Cryptocurrencies is a new market with no proper regulations which means it is natural to expect that those who can afford to not play by the rules, most likely won’t.

Hello friends,  

It's been a while since my last post; lack of time and an urge to do more research has mainly driven me to take a break from posting ideas on TradingView. I am still in the process of doing more research and study, but I figure posting once in a while couldn't hurt. 

Since I have become recently very convinced about this, I am outlining a very possible situation with  Bitcoin              where the  trend line  we have been on since early October breaks, reaching around a temporary low of $5000. This is examined on the  daily chart , since this is one of the best charts to examine trends of this size. I have to first and foremost say that I am not trying to spread fear, I know many people do not like to hear  bearish  ideas, but  technical analysis  is ultimately a rational exercise, and I feel that possibilities with very strong signs should be explored. 

There are a few things to look at, but I first want to talk about the big picture with, long-term  support and resistance  lines. I think most people can agree that there was a very significant downtrending resistance line that began from the peak of the  ATH              in late December, to the low of around $6400 (thick red line). After the break from that line, it seems we moved into a sideways trend, bouncing back and forth between an emerging downtrending resistance line (light red) and a support line that we seem to have been respecting since mid-October (light green); at least this appears to be the case with the lows, where the angle's effectiveness appears very strongly. Finally, based on previous bounces, we can establish a support of around $5000-$5300 (I've thus created a small  support zone  around that range, in dark green), as well as lower supports around $3200 and $2000 (though I do not believe these will be reached, in dark green).   

Now, onto the analysis - it's no secret that  Bitcoin              has been squeezing in, ready for a significant move either upwards or downwards. Initially I considered the upwards move to be more likely due to the significant media attention cryptocurrency has been receiving, but after viewing previous market cycles of  Bitcoin              (check 2013), it seems clear to me that the  bearish  scenario of closing in on the market cycle is very likely, and should at the very least be prepared for with proper risk management. According to Dow Theory, which is said to have laid the foundations of modern  technical analysis , history repeats itself, and this is a situation where we forced to consider this. 

Should we break from the line, we will likely fall straight down to the $5000-$5000 area, where we will shoot back up and bounce towards around $6700 or so (maybe a little less). From there one, we will likely enter a sideways trend, which we will continue until we see higher highs and higher lows and parabolic movement returns, which could lead to us challenging the all-time high, and hitting $35k-$50k. 

NOTE: I seem to have reached the max character limit for this section of the idea, so I will continue my text below.

Comment:
					Onto the short-term: 


Scenario A: 

The reason why I have drawn this movement into a pennant is this way, is simply because we have been moving through this ascending triangle for quite a while now (May 23rd to today). I don't think that the pattern will be sufficient to directly lead into a strong sell-off, but we should consider that the size of ascending triangle suggests a small movement downwards at the very least, which can create a higher low, and thus move into position into a bearish pennant. Why would a bearish pennant occur here and not have a bounce to $8500-$8700? The reason is in positioning - the huge downtrend (May 5th to May 26th) creates a very nice flagpole in which it hits around the $5000 area very perfectly, and thus I would not be surprised if this happens. 

Second reason: on the Stoch RSI indicator on the daily chart, it appears to be dangerously high, which would suggest it being oversold. For the most part, it seems to have called lows and highs, at least to some extent. This overdrawn movement may very well have increased the likelyhood of Bitcoin being oversold. This could suggest that this is the last step into a sharp downturn, but this does not preclude Situation B. Volume has also been steadily decreasing, but this is the case with any sort of consolidation, I believe. 

Finally, the lines I have drawn below the triangle are simply bounces that I think seem fairly reasonable. The length from to support to the lines correlate with the length of the flagpole, of course, though it may seem chopped off due to the huge line from the long-term support downwards. 


Scenario B: 

This is much simpler, Bitcoin hits the upper resistance line, bounces off, challenges the lower support line, and we potentially see a break, and the rest unfolds from there. 


----------------------------------------------------------------------- 


With all this being said, do not fear if you are hoping for more parabolic movement - this likely will not be the end, and will simply be the set up for a long, drawn out sideways movement until the first signs of bullish activity begin and we start all over again. If you are longing around here, please consider using risk management, prepare for every possibility. If you are shorting, the same applies. 

Please trade with care. I wish the best to all traders!

Comment:
					This really is a very minor note, but I just want to emphasize that the rising wedge (which I erroneously refer to as an ascending triangle, a bad habit I have) entering a bearish pennant is more based on intuition than anything. Also, this pennant is mainly based on the conservative assumption that the break will happen at 7900, if it happens at 7700 where we seem to be general resistance, the pennant would look something like this:

Jun 7




I am Mid term-bullish on  BTC              going into the end of this week, but looking to get into the market on a pull back to occur before I get in to the market.  The jury is still out as to whether this weekly bear trend is ready to turn around.  

We can see that both the  RSI  and  MFI  are both  Bullish  on the daily having bottomed when reaching oversold on both at c. $7k support where we found our longer term  trend line . 

We are currently in the process of meeting the Tenkan (blue line) as I write this, so in the very short term, I am looking for a pull back to $7550 range for an entry.  One of the main reasons for this is that on the 4hour timeframes we are close to completing an edge to edge trade so the risk reward doesn’t fit my profile, however a break out from the cloud or above the Tenkan around $7777 will make me enter the market. 

The  RSI  and  MFI  have both been excellent indicators in this bear market.  Whenever  RSI  has gone above the 60 and the  MFI  80; its time to exit the market from a  bullish  trade and consider shorting as it progresses higher.   

Based on the  RSI ,  MFI  trends and the fact that we will run into the Kijun at just around $8-8.2k, I will be scalling out at this  bearish  confluence level to start looking for pull backs and reassessment as i believe it to be a key point as  

Best case scenario this trade would yield a 10% return before leverage. 
This is for illustrative purposes only, please DYOR and goodluck with your trading.

So the pullback trade that we were looking at worked out & has made it's way back to the neckline level of structure. We are now at what i like to call a ""decision point"" Essentially IF price is able to violate this current level od structure THEN we're likely to continue to our next price projection.  

Something that a lot of newer traders don't understand is that when it comes to bigger moves, the market will often provide multiple opportunities to get involved. For those who don't rush and for those who don't get discouraged. If you perform consistent analysis you can often find multiple ways to involve yourself in a trade even if you missed the first strike.

Recent price action has clear signs of wash trading / market manipulation fud and lots of nonsense. Its hard to prove almost impossible so as a trader we just need to deal with it. Ideally the situation you are supposed to trade are critical break up and break down points to enter the trade. Dont enter or exit dumb trades and lose money.

I am never good with words so instead of writing paragraphs of clarification to justify my call for SHORT since my last posting, I have explained everything on my chart with the least words possible using Fibonacci. It does not matter how popular  Bitcoin -1.55%  has become, or how deep it has disrupted the financial sector, or how many institutional investors have come to invest in it -- the psychology behind a market cycle does not change. 

I don't really encourage anyone to short  Bitcoin -1.55% , but in all honesty, don't expect the bulls to fly anytime soon. Like I said before, this correction that we are having right now is the ""MOTHER OF ALL CORRECTIONS"" after a 4-year-long bull cycle since the 2013 correction... and we are just halfway through.

My best idea ever, taking some time off the last 2 days :) The whales just continue to play their little games by squeezing leveraged short and long positions out of the market. Can't play them, it's just too easy. Maybe it's time we retail traders stand together, combine our  volume  and use their own game against them. Yeah, maybe we could even make a blockbuster movie about this :) I love me some science fiction :) LOL  

My last update of the previous analysis i showed 2 important support levels where the price could bounce up from. The first support around 7350 did the trick and the price got pushed back to 7700. From that point on i told my members that i thought i was seeing distribution, but it was still very confusing to figure out what was going on. TA was showing  bullish  signs, that  bull flag  was very strong and was even turning slowly up and was about to squeeze upwards. But of course out of no where the price got dumped, the move we saw a few hours ago. After that 200 point drop the price got pushed up again to 7700 like that dump was a glitch. If your a whale, why not push out leveraged traders and take your money while your accumulating or distributing. It's like a bonus, like the cherry on top :)  

Anyway, in this chart we can see allot of similarities of what is going on. As you know i have been saying i am still  bearish  for the medium term, but i just could not say what was going to happen on the short term. 2 days ago after we finally dropped out of that  wedge , i said we would have 2 options.  
- Break those 2 support levels from the last update of my previous chart (73xx and 71xx) 
- Make a higher low at those same support levels and make another move up above the high.  
 
As we can see in the chart, the  fractal  is not 100% identical so it's no guarantee that the 7700 high we just saw is the high already and that we start to move down. But based on this  fractal , i don't want to see the price get above the 7800/7900. This  fractal  confirms my  bearish  view as well. That's why TA is so great, you can turn any chart to fit your view :). 

Even without this  fractal , i just give it a very small chance that 7K price action is the fundament of a low to start another bull rally, i just highly doubt that. I want to see more  volume  to begin with and at least  double bottom  kind of formation. So the minimum i expect is a test of the 7100/6900in the coming week or 2. But the movement i have in mind for the med term is a drop below the 7K to form a big V shape low. If we get to see that, than i might even become  bullish  for the rest of the year :).  

As long as the price stays above the 73xx, we have to assume the bulls are still in control and we should see another wave up. So for me the 73xx is an important turning point.

					This is my bigger picture, think this bearish triangle is still 100% in play. I think if bulls can't break the 7800/7900 the bearish version is probably going to happen. Can't say HOW it will go, this blue line is just a guess. But a big V shape low would be the most bullish for the long term. I still think we are seeing distribution here. The only way this idea can be countered, is through a big increase of buying volume, if that doesn't happen, i think it's only a matter of time.

					What a surprise, nothing has changed :) 

The price took a small dump but the volume was low so no real read on what the intent was. So we might see another move up, if we start to see a small pump that takes out the 7800, be aware of a fake breakout. The blue line is a possibility of what the move could look like IF we move up and if the breakout fails. If that happens than we will probably get confirmation if the price breaks the 7600ish. If we break the 7800 it should stay above the 7700 to confirm another move up. Not much more to say about what's going on.

					So we have made a small drop, but there is no volume confirming it, not yet at least. First small support has been broken, but not yet very meaningful because of the low volume. For the ones who shorted it, just be aware of another squeeze up, since this small move downwards looks a bit to controlled.  

Pure TA, it broke the channel and retested the former support as resistance now.

757,1528359434.0,Taiwan_Bear,2618 (Double top & 0.618 pull-back) - do not miss it!!,"
In the last couple of TAs I have mentioned the “2618 pattern” and have been asked what 2618 means. Sorry for taking it so long as it took me quite a while to put everything altogether. But, as promised, I have explained below the rules and trade setups for the 2618 pattern.  

What are the rules/setups/steps for 2618?  
1.	Form a  double top  (Note #1)  
2.	Neckline has to be broken  
3.	After price found support at point (b), wait for pull back to 0.618 fib retracement of (a)(b)  
4.	After price retraced to 0.618, look for confluence and sell (eg. Structures,  trendlines  ,  double top  on a lower time frame,  rsi  divergence,  bearish pin bar  ,  inside bar  break down etc.) (Note #2)  
5.	Stop loss to be set above  double top 
6.	Set Take Profit levels (Note #3)  

Note #1 ( Double top ):  
The first step for the formation of 2618 is to form a  double top  at key resistance levels. Why at key resistance levels? Because we want to avoid fake double tops which can occur occasionally.  

There are some variations between various resources (books, websites) regarding the definitions of “double top”. The main differences occur where:  
a)	Some said for a  double top  to be valid, the wick of the 2nd top cannot exceed the wick of the 1st top; whereas, others said:  
b)	The wick of the 2nd top can exceed the wick of the 1st top but the candle close of the 2nd top CANNOT exceed the wick of the 1st top; or  
c)	The wick of the 2nd top can exceed the wick of the 1st top and the candle close of the 2nd top CAN exceed the wick of the 1st top; or  
d)	The wick of the 2nd top meets at least the candle close of the 1st top; or  
e)	The body of the 2nd top cannot exceed the body of the 1st top  

Personally, I would say all the above definitions work just fine although I do prefer definition a) because it means that the selling pressure is strong and the bulls fail to make a higher high. When there is a higher high formed in a downtrend, it can mean the downtrend has reversed and therefore you might not want to sell when the price pulls back to the 0.618 fib retracement.  

Note #2 ( 0.618 retracement ):  
When the price pulls back to 0.618, it does not mean to sell straight away. There must be more than one reason to sell other than the 0.618 retrace. The more reasons the better. In this example, you can see there are certainly structures (key resistance levels) at the 0.618 retrace. As well, there was a  double top  formed on the lower time frame. Consequently, you can sell.  

After  BTC              hit the 0.618 retrace the first time, the price dropped from $9735 to $8650. but quickly bounced back to the 0.618 retrace level. That was a second & better opportunity to sell. Not only did  BTC              form a  double top  on the larger time frame, but also with a  bearish  divergence on the 4hr time frame. Accordingly, you have more reasons to sell.  

Note #3 (Set take profit)  
Same as the rules of “Double top”, there are some variations as to which price level should you take profits. Personally, I would stick to the below:  
1)	First, take profit when risk/reward ratio hits 1:1 (recommend to take 30% - 50% profits and adjust the SL of the remaining positions to break-even)  
2)	When price hits the same price level as the low after the neckline is broken ((b) point in this example)  
3)	When price hits 1.272 fib extension of (a)(b)  
4)	When price hits point (d) (using  AB=CD  pattern. If you are not sure what the rules of  AB=CD  are, you can refer to my previous TA in which I have attached the link below)  
5)	If in a one-way market (heavily bearish/bullish), you can always keep 10% to 20% of your positions and take profits when risk/reward ratio hits 1:5 or even 1:10

 BTC -1.61%  is on the verge of breaking to a daily higher high on the bounce if the bulls can see a push this morning. 
If we reject from here the daily will form a lower high and we will see a tightening pattern within the highlighted  support and resistance  lines.  
Important for the bulls to show up or we could stay in this range into tomorrow.  
Healthy consolidation after the most recent bull move and the 15 min chart needs to change the trend.  
Also look to  EMA  12 support on the 4 hour and hourly.  
Another morning like yesterday with the bulls comfortable as worst case, we likely stay in the tightening pattern if bulls cannot prove themselves.

The current situation of  Bitcoin -1.61%  is quite difficult. We are on a clear treshold. A lot of traders are saying that we are on a clear downtrend, but the same amount of people are claiming that we will have our reversal soon. 

This article tries to sum up all important information you have to need! 

1: Retracement of a parabolic uptrend: 
There is a rule of thumb for the retracement of a parabolic uptrend. We should retrace to approx. the 0.786  Fibonacci Retracement  +/- 10%! 
Depending where we start the count, we are already in that target. Although both ways (blue and red) have still some space for a further downwave! 







2: The bloody support of Bitcoin: 
The average cost of mining one  bitcoin -1.61%  are at USA/Russia approx. 4700$ and at 3100$ for china! 
A drop below a target of 4700$ would be savage. Nevertheless, i can't image that we will hit that target. 







3: Manipulation of  Bitcoin -1.61%  and the Bart Simpson Pattern: 
A friend of mine found some unusual patterns in the orderbooks of several exchanges: 
https://twitter.com/CryptoSyndrome 
Altcoins are manipulated on a daily basis. It seems that  bitcoin -1.61%  is now affected to this too, which causes all these 3-5% pump and dumps. 
Thus, we are forming all the time the Bartin Simpsons Patterns.

5: Deminishing downtrend and a strong support 
If we see the falling  wedges  as the force of the downtrend, then the force is diminishing! 
Furthermore we have strong support which is holding now for the 4th time! 







6: The Indicators 
Having a look at the indicators at 2D, we have a good potential for an upwave now. 
The  volume  is deminishing which should indicate a breakout soon. 
The  MACD  is about to cross, the  RSI  was slightly overbought and is heading up like the  Stoch .  RSI . 
The 200  EMA  is slighty under the current price and act as a support. 

7: The symetrical Triangle 
The theory says, that we should have in a  sym -0.80% . triangle 5 times an  ABC  wave. The waves are not perfect, but we can construct them. 






As you can see, the last four ABC-Waves formed always a 1:1 extention, which indicates that we have finished wave 5. 

8: A possible Head and Shoulders 
Even if this is not the most perfect  Head and Shoulders  Pattern, it's still valid! 
We are currently at the neckline, which is a strong and important resistance. Breaking upwards should indicate a good uptrend. 







9: The magic  6th 0.00%  of the month 






Suprisingly we have on every  6th 0.00%  of the month a reversal. Why is that??? 
One reason could be the  CME Group Futures  with dates for the settlements always nearby the  6th 0.00%  of the month! 
http://www.cmegroup.com 

10: Longterm  Bullish  TA 
The whole pattern could be seen as a big  bullish pennant . 







11: Shortterm  Bullish  TA 
Leading diagonal  starting wave1 of an  Elliott Wave , since we have now an impulse wave, after the 5x  ABC  pattern inside the triangle is finished. 
Our target should be at the top of the triangle nearby 8600-8800$. 







12: Longterm  Bearish  TA 
We also can argue, that we are currenty in an downtrend and the  sym -0.80% . triangle just continuing the trend. 
Our target should be nearby 6000$ which is also a finished downwards  Elliott Wave .

Nothing is happening in the market:  volatility  has become extinct and coins' trading fallen out of fashion. Range-bound bots and robotic humans absolutely prosper in this environment. The price was unable to break the 7700 threshold. For me this is a  bearish  signal. Indicators provide mixed signals, so let's examine wave structure. The move from May 29 is a  3-wave -0.12%  correction within a larger downtrend. A price drop below 7500 would confirm this scenario.

					Impulse Wave Truncation (Truncated Fifth) - 
Truncated 5th wave is when the market has become so over-extended in Wave 3 that there is not much force left for the impulse wave to come to a proper completion. So when this happens, there is a chance that the last wave of the impulse, Wave 5, will not reach the end of Wave 3 before the market starts correcting in the opposite direction. At this point, the market is just too exhausted. This condition is often called a “failure” or a “Truncation.”

I can see many people still believe that we are going inside a  descending triangle . I also believed this in my idea that i shard on may 1st: 



 

Things can change so quickly and if we didn't adapt to the changes then someone will. That's why i believe that we have to be in fast adapt mode in this market. Doesn't mean that you need to change without checking yourself. I try to find 2-3 confirmations before i change my idea on something. This includes pattern changes, trend changes etc 

There are 21 corrective wave patterns in EW which is categorized into major 3 corrective wave patterns: 

Zigzag  (5-3-5) 
Flat (3-3-5) 
Triangle (3-3-3-3-3) 

And other patterns are combinations of the above which is:  

Double three (A combination of two corrective patterns above) 
Triple three (A combination of three corrective patterns above) 

So what i can see now is that we are in two double three combination corrective wave pattern: 








More info here:  

https://elliottwave-forecast.com/elliott-wave-theory/#corrective-waves 

Confirmations: 

1. Wave ((i)) of C is 1.6k and ((v)) is going to be completed below the triangle 
2. Wave (E) of the triangle can't go beyond the triangle.  
3. This has happened twice before in 2013 & 2015 

Each wave  got 3 subwaves (a,b &c) inside and we are in the subwave c of ((y)) of Y which is an impulsive wave. 

Impulsive waves: 1,3,5,a,c 
Corrective waves: 2,4,b 

Normal Fibo Ratios for these waves are: 

wave 2 = 0.5 - 0.8 of wave 1  
wave 3 = 1.236 - 1.618 of wave 1  
wave 4 = 0.5 - 0.618 of wave 3  
wave 5 = 0.618 - 1 of wave 1  
wave B = 0.5 - 0.8 of wave A  
wave C = 0.618 - 1.236 of wave A  

Now if you check what happened in subwave a of ((y)) of Y you can see that: 

Wave (i) of a: 985$ 
Wave (ii) of a: 434$  
Wave ( iii -0.47% ) of a: 1207$  
Wave (iv) of a: 691$ [~0.618 of Wave ( iii -0.47% )] 
Wave (v) of a: 950$  








I have seen  BTC -1.61%  impulsive waves fibo ratios almost the same as the previous impulsive wave fibo ratios. 
Now if you apply the same for the last wave C of (E) this is what you get: 

Wave ((i)) of c: 1587$ 
Wave ((ii)) of c  = 793$ 
Wave (( iii -0.47% )) of c  = 1961$ 
Wave ((iv)) of c [~0.618 of Wave (( iii -0.47% ))] = 1212$ 
Wave ((v)) of c  = 1587$ 








Also note that Wave ((iv)) might not retrace upto 0.618 of Wave (( iii -0.47% )) as everyone will be in panic mode by that time so minimum retracement would be around 0.386 of Wave (( iii -0.47% )) which is around 756$ and this is why i can see it goes down to 5k level or little bit more towards 4.7k which is the lowest level of the  support zone  (orange dotted lines) 








So 3 Possible Support lines for reversal would be 

1. Blue: 5800 - 6100 (Only possible if Wave ((v)) is truncated) 
2. Orange: 4700 - 5000 (This is most likely where we heading)  
3. Red: 4100 - 4400 (Only possible if Wave (( iii -0.47% )) is extended)

 Bitcoin -1.61%  has recently developed an interesting pattern of completing a  bullish  and  bearish  cycle on the sixth of every month in an alternating order. As we can see in the chart above, a fall is followed by a rise. This has happened twice before and is expected to happen again now on the  6th 0.00%  of June, 2018. This time  Bitcoin -1.61%  will finish a  bearish  cycle and I expected to begin the next  bullish  cycle at least till the end of  6th 0.00%  of July, 2018. 

This pattern of rise and fall is also supported by other patterns on the chart that signal a  bullish  reversal. The support line has also held firmly and if this pattern of alternating rise and fall ensues,  Bitcoin -1.61%  could very well make new highs by the end of the year. The  RSI  is recovering from oversold levels and has now approached a normal.  Bitcoin -1.61%  is currently at a favorable point for  bullish  entries. The price broke a long term resistance as it break past the downtrend line in April, 2018. This was a big accomplishment for the bulls but the lack of confidence pulled the price back to the support line. Currently, the price is just above the support line and appears to be all set for a  bullish  comeback but the reality is, there are not enough bulls in the market. 

The past few months have been devastating for the price of  Bitcoin -1.61%  ( BTC -1.61% ) and a lot of investors are still running scared. Institutional investors are looking for more clarity regarding regulations concerning cryptocurrencies and also safer ways to invest and store their coins. As for retail investors, most of them comprise of first time investors who have never traded any financial asset before. So, when they saw that  Bitcoin -1.61%  ( BTC -1.61% ) is making 20% gains every day, they thought this could go on forever and jumped with both feet, only to find the carpet pulled under from their feet. Big investors have always played small investors as cannon fodder and have gotten away with their schemes even in regulated markets like forex or the stock market. Cryptocurrencies is a new market with no proper regulations which means it is natural to expect that those who can afford to not play by the rules, most likely won’t.

Hello friends,  

It's been a while since my last post; lack of time and an urge to do more research has mainly driven me to take a break from posting ideas on TradingView. I am still in the process of doing more research and study, but I figure posting once in a while couldn't hurt. 

Since I have become recently very convinced about this, I am outlining a very possible situation with  Bitcoin              where the  trend line  we have been on since early October breaks, reaching around a temporary low of $5000. This is examined on the  daily chart , since this is one of the best charts to examine trends of this size. I have to first and foremost say that I am not trying to spread fear, I know many people do not like to hear  bearish  ideas, but  technical analysis  is ultimately a rational exercise, and I feel that possibilities with very strong signs should be explored. 

There are a few things to look at, but I first want to talk about the big picture with, long-term  support and resistance  lines. I think most people can agree that there was a very significant downtrending resistance line that began from the peak of the  ATH              in late December, to the low of around $6400 (thick red line). After the break from that line, it seems we moved into a sideways trend, bouncing back and forth between an emerging downtrending resistance line (light red) and a support line that we seem to have been respecting since mid-October (light green); at least this appears to be the case with the lows, where the angle's effectiveness appears very strongly. Finally, based on previous bounces, we can establish a support of around $5000-$5300 (I've thus created a small  support zone  around that range, in dark green), as well as lower supports around $3200 and $2000 (though I do not believe these will be reached, in dark green).   

Now, onto the analysis - it's no secret that  Bitcoin              has been squeezing in, ready for a significant move either upwards or downwards. Initially I considered the upwards move to be more likely due to the significant media attention cryptocurrency has been receiving, but after viewing previous market cycles of  Bitcoin              (check 2013), it seems clear to me that the  bearish  scenario of closing in on the market cycle is very likely, and should at the very least be prepared for with proper risk management. According to Dow Theory, which is said to have laid the foundations of modern  technical analysis , history repeats itself, and this is a situation where we forced to consider this. 

Should we break from the line, we will likely fall straight down to the $5000-$5000 area, where we will shoot back up and bounce towards around $6700 or so (maybe a little less). From there one, we will likely enter a sideways trend, which we will continue until we see higher highs and higher lows and parabolic movement returns, which could lead to us challenging the all-time high, and hitting $35k-$50k. 

NOTE: I seem to have reached the max character limit for this section of the idea, so I will continue my text below.

Comment:
					Onto the short-term: 


Scenario A: 

The reason why I have drawn this movement into a pennant is this way, is simply because we have been moving through this ascending triangle for quite a while now (May 23rd to today). I don't think that the pattern will be sufficient to directly lead into a strong sell-off, but we should consider that the size of ascending triangle suggests a small movement downwards at the very least, which can create a higher low, and thus move into position into a bearish pennant. Why would a bearish pennant occur here and not have a bounce to $8500-$8700? The reason is in positioning - the huge downtrend (May 5th to May 26th) creates a very nice flagpole in which it hits around the $5000 area very perfectly, and thus I would not be surprised if this happens. 

Second reason: on the Stoch RSI indicator on the daily chart, it appears to be dangerously high, which would suggest it being oversold. For the most part, it seems to have called lows and highs, at least to some extent. This overdrawn movement may very well have increased the likelyhood of Bitcoin being oversold. This could suggest that this is the last step into a sharp downturn, but this does not preclude Situation B. Volume has also been steadily decreasing, but this is the case with any sort of consolidation, I believe. 

Finally, the lines I have drawn below the triangle are simply bounces that I think seem fairly reasonable. The length from to support to the lines correlate with the length of the flagpole, of course, though it may seem chopped off due to the huge line from the long-term support downwards. 


Scenario B: 

This is much simpler, Bitcoin hits the upper resistance line, bounces off, challenges the lower support line, and we potentially see a break, and the rest unfolds from there. 


----------------------------------------------------------------------- 


With all this being said, do not fear if you are hoping for more parabolic movement - this likely will not be the end, and will simply be the set up for a long, drawn out sideways movement until the first signs of bullish activity begin and we start all over again. If you are longing around here, please consider using risk management, prepare for every possibility. If you are shorting, the same applies. 

Please trade with care. I wish the best to all traders!

Comment:
					This really is a very minor note, but I just want to emphasize that the rising wedge (which I erroneously refer to as an ascending triangle, a bad habit I have) entering a bearish pennant is more based on intuition than anything. Also, this pennant is mainly based on the conservative assumption that the break will happen at 7900, if it happens at 7700 where we seem to be general resistance, the pennant would look something like this:

Jun 7




I am Mid term-bullish on  BTC -1.61%  going into the end of this week, but looking to get into the market on a pull back to occur before I get in to the market.  The jury is still out as to whether this weekly bear trend is ready to turn around.  

We can see that both the  RSI  and  MFI  are both  Bullish  on the daily having bottomed when reaching oversold on both at c. $7k support where we found our longer term  trend line . 

We are currently in the process of meeting the Tenkan (blue line) as I write this, so in the very short term, I am looking for a pull back to $7550 range for an entry.  One of the main reasons for this is that on the 4hour timeframes we are close to completing an edge to edge trade so the risk reward doesn’t fit my profile, however a break out from the cloud or above the Tenkan around $7777 will make me enter the market. 

The  RSI  and  MFI  have both been excellent indicators in this bear market.  Whenever  RSI  has gone above the 60 and the  MFI  80; its time to exit the market from a  bullish  trade and consider shorting as it progresses higher.   

Based on the  RSI ,  MFI  trends and the fact that we will run into the Kijun at just around $8-8.2k, I will be scalling out at this  bearish  confluence level to start looking for pull backs and reassessment as i believe it to be a key point as  

Best case scenario this trade would yield a 10% return before leverage. 
This is for illustrative purposes only, please DYOR and goodluck with your trading.

So the pullback trade that we were looking at worked out & has made it's way back to the neckline level of structure. We are now at what i like to call a ""decision point"" Essentially IF price is able to violate this current level od structure THEN we're likely to continue to our next price projection.  

Something that a lot of newer traders don't understand is that when it comes to bigger moves, the market will often provide multiple opportunities to get involved. For those who don't rush and for those who don't get discouraged. If you perform consistent analysis you can often find multiple ways to involve yourself in a trade even if you missed the first strike.

My best idea ever, taking some time off the last 2 days :) The whales just continue to play their little games by squeezing leveraged short and long positions out of the market. Can't play them, it's just too easy. Maybe it's time we retail traders stand together, combine our  volume  and use their own game against them. Yeah, maybe we could even make a blockbuster movie about this :) I love me some science fiction :) LOL  

My last update of the previous analysis i showed 2 important support levels where the price could bounce up from. The first support around 7350 did the trick and the price got pushed back to 7700. From that point on i told my members that i thought i was seeing distribution, but it was still very confusing to figure out what was going on. TA was showing  bullish  signs, that  bull flag  was very strong and was even turning slowly up and was about to squeeze upwards. But of course out of no where the price got dumped, the move we saw a few hours ago. After that 200 point drop the price got pushed up again to 7700 like that dump was a glitch. If your a whale, why not push out leveraged traders and take your money while your accumulating or distributing. It's like a bonus, like the cherry on top :)  

Anyway, in this chart we can see allot of similarities of what is going on. As you know i have been saying i am still  bearish  for the medium term, but i just could not say what was going to happen on the short term. 2 days ago after we finally dropped out of that  wedge , i said we would have 2 options.  
- Break those 2 support levels from the last update of my previous chart (73xx and 71xx) 
- Make a higher low at those same support levels and make another move up above the high.  
 
As we can see in the chart, the  fractal  is not 100% identical so it's no guarantee that the 7700 high we just saw is the high already and that we start to move down. But based on this  fractal , i don't want to see the price get above the 7800/7900. This  fractal  confirms my  bearish  view as well. That's why TA is so great, you can turn any chart to fit your view :). 

Even without this  fractal , i just give it a very small chance that 7K price action is the fundament of a low to start another bull rally, i just highly doubt that. I want to see more  volume  to begin with and at least  double bottom  kind of formation. So the minimum i expect is a test of the 7100/6900in the coming week or 2. But the movement i have in mind for the med term is a drop below the 7K to form a big V shape low. If we get to see that, than i might even become  bullish  for the rest of the year :).  

As long as the price stays above the 73xx, we have to assume the bulls are still in control and we should see another wave up. So for me the 73xx is an important turning point.

Comment:
					At the moment it looks like bulls are trying to push higher, this bull flag/triangle is still very strong. So no sign of weakness yet! First small sign would be a drop below 7620/7600. Bulls need to break 7700

Comment:
					This is my bigger picture, think this bearish triangle is still 100% in play. I think if bulls can't break the 7800/7900 the bearish version is probably going to happen. Can't say HOW it will go, this blue line is just a guess. But a big V shape low would be the most bullish for the long term. I still think we are seeing distribution here. The only way this idea can be countered, is through a big increase of buying volume, if that doesn't happen, i think it's only a matter of time.

					Lower time frame we can see a new upwards channel and maybe even a rising wedge. From the looks of it, it's slowly going down to test the support line again. Depending on what will happen there we can make a better prediction for the rest of the day.

					What a surprise, nothing has changed :) 

The price took a small dump but the volume was low so no real read on what the intent was. So we might see another move up, if we start to see a small pump that takes out the 7800, be aware of a fake breakout. The blue line is a possibility of what the move could look like IF we move up and if the breakout fails. If that happens than we will probably get confirmation if the price breaks the 7600ish. If we break the 7800 it should stay above the 7700 to confirm another move up. Not much more to say about what's going on.

Comment:
					So we have made a small drop, but there is no volume confirming it, not yet at least. First small support has been broken, but not yet very meaningful because of the low volume. For the ones who shorted it, just be aware of another squeeze up, since this small move downwards looks a bit to controlled.  

Pure TA, it broke the channel and retested the former support as resistance now.

775,1528359434.0,Taiwan_Bear,2618 (Double top & 0.618 pull-back) - do not miss it!!,"
In the last couple of TAs I have mentioned the “2618 pattern” and have been asked what 2618 means. Sorry for taking it so long as it took me quite a while to put everything altogether. But, as promised, I have explained below the rules and trade setups for the 2618 pattern.  

What are the rules/setups/steps for 2618?  
1.	Form a  double top  (Note #1)  
2.	Neckline has to be broken  
3.	After price found support at point (b), wait for pull back to 0.618 fib retracement of (a)(b)  
4.	After price retraced to 0.618, look for confluence and sell (eg. Structures,  trendlines  ,  double top  on a lower time frame,  rsi  divergence,  bearish pin bar  ,  inside bar  break down etc.) (Note #2)  
5.	Stop loss to be set above  double top 
6.	Set Take Profit levels (Note #3)  

Note #1 ( Double top ):  
The first step for the formation of 2618 is to form a  double top  at key resistance levels. Why at key resistance levels? Because we want to avoid fake double tops which can occur occasionally.  

There are some variations between various resources (books, websites) regarding the definitions of “double top”. The main differences occur where:  
a)	Some said for a  double top  to be valid, the wick of the 2nd top cannot exceed the wick of the 1st top; whereas, others said:  
b)	The wick of the 2nd top can exceed the wick of the 1st top but the candle close of the 2nd top CANNOT exceed the wick of the 1st top; or  
c)	The wick of the 2nd top can exceed the wick of the 1st top and the candle close of the 2nd top CAN exceed the wick of the 1st top; or  
d)	The wick of the 2nd top meets at least the candle close of the 1st top; or  
e)	The body of the 2nd top cannot exceed the body of the 1st top  

Personally, I would say all the above definitions work just fine although I do prefer definition a) because it means that the selling pressure is strong and the bulls fail to make a higher high. When there is a higher high formed in a downtrend, it can mean the downtrend has reversed and therefore you might not want to sell when the price pulls back to the 0.618 fib retracement.  

Note #2 ( 0.618 retracement ):  
When the price pulls back to 0.618, it does not mean to sell straight away. There must be more than one reason to sell other than the 0.618 retrace. The more reasons the better. In this example, you can see there are certainly structures (key resistance levels) at the 0.618 retrace. As well, there was a  double top  formed on the lower time frame. Consequently, you can sell.  

After  BTC -1.61%  hit the 0.618 retrace the first time, the price dropped from $9735 to $8650. but quickly bounced back to the 0.618 retrace level. That was a second & better opportunity to sell. Not only did  BTC -1.61%  form a  double top  on the larger time frame, but also with a  bearish  divergence on the 4hr time frame. Accordingly, you have more reasons to sell.  

Note #3 (Set take profit)  
Same as the rules of “Double top”, there are some variations as to which price level should you take profits. Personally, I would stick to the below:  
1)	First, take profit when risk/reward ratio hits 1:1 (recommend to take 30% - 50% profits and adjust the SL of the remaining positions to break-even)  
2)	When price hits the same price level as the low after the neckline is broken ((b) point in this example)  
3)	When price hits 1.272 fib extension of (a)(b)  
4)	When price hits point (d) (using  AB=CD  pattern. If you are not sure what the rules of  AB=CD  are, you can refer to my previous TA in which I have attached the link below)  
5)	If in a one-way market (heavily bearish/bullish), you can always keep 10% to 20% of your positions and take profits when risk/reward ratio hits 1:5 or even 1:10

 BTC -1.61%  is on the verge of breaking to a daily higher high on the bounce if the bulls can see a push this morning. 
If we reject from here the daily will form a lower high and we will see a tightening pattern within the highlighted  support and resistance  lines.  
Important for the bulls to show up or we could stay in this range into tomorrow.  
Healthy consolidation after the most recent bull move and the 15 min chart needs to change the trend.  
Also look to  EMA  12 support on the 4 hour and hourly.  
Another morning like yesterday with the bulls comfortable as worst case, we likely stay in the tightening pattern if bulls cannot prove themselves.

The current situation of  Bitcoin -1.61%  is quite difficult. We are on a clear treshold. A lot of traders are saying that we are on a clear downtrend, but the same amount of people are claiming that we will have our reversal soon. 

This article tries to sum up all important information you have to need! 

1: Retracement of a parabolic uptrend: 
There is a rule of thumb for the retracement of a parabolic uptrend. We should retrace to approx. the 0.786  Fibonacci Retracement  +/- 10%! 
Depending where we start the count, we are already in that target. Although both ways (blue and red) have still some space for a further downwave! 







2: The bloody support of Bitcoin: 
The average cost of mining one  bitcoin -1.61%  are at USA/Russia approx. 4700$ and at 3100$ for china! 
A drop below a target of 4700$ would be savage. Nevertheless, i can't image that we will hit that target. 







3: Manipulation of  Bitcoin -1.61%  and the Bart Simpson Pattern: 
A friend of mine found some unusual patterns in the orderbooks of several exchanges: 
https://twitter.com/CryptoSyndrome 
Altcoins are manipulated on a daily basis. It seems that  bitcoin -1.61%  is now affected to this too, which causes all these 3-5% pump and dumps. 
Thus, we are forming all the time the Bartin Simpsons Patterns. 

4: Similarity to 2014: 
Bitcoin -1.61%  now: 






Bitcoin -1.61%  2014: 







5: Deminishing downtrend and a strong support 
If we see the falling  wedges  as the force of the downtrend, then the force is diminishing! 
Furthermore we have strong support which is holding now for the 4th time! 







6: The Indicators 
Having a look at the indicators at 2D, we have a good potential for an upwave now. 
The  volume  is deminishing which should indicate a breakout soon. 
The  MACD  is about to cross, the  RSI  was slightly overbought and is heading up like the  Stoch .  RSI . 
The 200  EMA  is slighty under the current price and act as a support. 

7: The symetrical Triangle 
The theory says, that we should have in a  sym -0.80% . triangle 5 times an  ABC  wave. The waves are not perfect, but we can construct them. 






As you can see, the last four ABC-Waves formed always a 1:1 extention, which indicates that we have finished wave 5. 

8: A possible Head and Shoulders 
Even if this is not the most perfect  Head and Shoulders  Pattern, it's still valid! 
We are currently at the neckline, which is a strong and important resistance. Breaking upwards should indicate a good uptrend. 







9: The magic  6th 0.00%  of the month 






Suprisingly we have on every  6th 0.00%  of the month a reversal. Why is that??? 
One reason could be the  CME Group Futures  with dates for the settlements always nearby the  6th 0.00%  of the month! 
http://www.cmegroup.com 

10: Longterm  Bullish  TA 
The whole pattern could be seen as a big  bullish pennant . 







11: Shortterm  Bullish  TA 
Leading diagonal  starting wave1 of an  Elliott Wave , since we have now an impulse wave, after the 5x  ABC  pattern inside the triangle is finished. 
Our target should be at the top of the triangle nearby 8600-8800$. 







12: Longterm  Bearish  TA 
We also can argue, that we are currenty in an downtrend and the  sym -0.80% . triangle just continuing the trend. 
Our target should be nearby 6000$ which is also a finished downwards  Elliott Wave .

Nothing is happening in the market:  volatility  has become extinct and coins' trading fallen out of fashion. Range-bound bots and robotic humans absolutely prosper in this environment. The price was unable to break the 7700 threshold. For me this is a  bearish  signal. Indicators provide mixed signals, so let's examine wave structure. The move from May 29 is a  3-wave -0.12%  correction within a larger downtrend. A price drop below 7500 would confirm this scenario.

					Impulse Wave Truncation (Truncated Fifth) - 
Truncated 5th wave is when the market has become so over-extended in Wave 3 that there is not much force left for the impulse wave to come to a proper completion. So when this happens, there is a chance that the last wave of the impulse, Wave 5, will not reach the end of Wave 3 before the market starts correcting in the opposite direction. At this point, the market is just too exhausted. This condition is often called a “failure” or a “Truncation.”

I can see many people still believe that we are going inside a  descending triangle . I also believed this in my idea that i shard on may 1st: 



 

Things can change so quickly and if we didn't adapt to the changes then someone will. That's why i believe that we have to be in fast adapt mode in this market. Doesn't mean that you need to change without checking yourself. I try to find 2-3 confirmations before i change my idea on something. This includes pattern changes, trend changes etc 

There are 21 corrective wave patterns in EW which is categorized into major 3 corrective wave patterns: 

Zigzag  (5-3-5) 
Flat (3-3-5) 
Triangle (3-3-3-3-3) 

And other patterns are combinations of the above which is:  

Double three (A combination of two corrective patterns above) 
Triple three (A combination of three corrective patterns above) 

So what i can see now is that we are in two double three combination corrective wave pattern: 








More info here:  

https://elliottwave-forecast.com/elliott-wave-theory/#corrective-waves 

Confirmations: 

1. Wave ((i)) of C is 1.6k and ((v)) is going to be completed below the triangle 
2. Wave (E) of the triangle can't go beyond the triangle.  
3. This has happened twice before in 2013 & 2015 

Each wave  got 3 subwaves (a,b &c) inside and we are in the subwave c of ((y)) of Y which is an impulsive wave. 

Impulsive waves: 1,3,5,a,c 
Corrective waves: 2,4,b 

Normal Fibo Ratios for these waves are: 

wave 2 = 0.5 - 0.8 of wave 1  
wave 3 = 1.236 - 1.618 of wave 1  
wave 4 = 0.5 - 0.618 of wave 3  
wave 5 = 0.618 - 1 of wave 1  
wave B = 0.5 - 0.8 of wave A  
wave C = 0.618 - 1.236 of wave A  

Now if you check what happened in subwave a of ((y)) of Y you can see that: 

Wave (i) of a: 985$ 
Wave (ii) of a: 434$  
Wave ( iii -0.47% ) of a: 1207$  
Wave (iv) of a: 691$ [~0.618 of Wave ( iii -0.47% )] 
Wave (v) of a: 950$  








I have seen  BTC -1.63%  impulsive waves fibo ratios almost the same as the previous impulsive wave fibo ratios. 
Now if you apply the same for the last wave C of (E) this is what you get: 

Wave ((i)) of c: 1587$ 
Wave ((ii)) of c  = 793$ 
Wave (( iii -0.47% )) of c  = 1961$ 
Wave ((iv)) of c [~0.618 of Wave (( iii -0.47% ))] = 1212$ 
Wave ((v)) of c  = 1587$ 








Also note that Wave ((iv)) might not retrace upto 0.618 of Wave (( iii -0.47% )) as everyone will be in panic mode by that time so minimum retracement would be around 0.386 of Wave (( iii -0.47% )) which is around 756$ and this is why i can see it goes down to 5k level or little bit more towards 4.7k which is the lowest level of the  support zone  (orange dotted lines) 








So 3 Possible Support lines for reversal would be 

1. Blue: 5800 - 6100 (Only possible if Wave ((v)) is truncated) 
2. Orange: 4700 - 5000 (This is most likely where we heading)  
3. Red: 4100 - 4400 (Only possible if Wave (( iii -0.47% )) is extended)

 Bitcoin -1.68%  has recently developed an interesting pattern of completing a  bullish  and  bearish  cycle on the sixth of every month in an alternating order. As we can see in the chart above, a fall is followed by a rise. This has happened twice before and is expected to happen again now on the  6th 0.00%  of June, 2018. This time  Bitcoin -1.68%  will finish a  bearish  cycle and I expected to begin the next  bullish  cycle at least till the end of  6th 0.00%  of July, 2018. 

This pattern of rise and fall is also supported by other patterns on the chart that signal a  bullish  reversal. The support line has also held firmly and if this pattern of alternating rise and fall ensues,  Bitcoin -1.68%  could very well make new highs by the end of the year. The  RSI  is recovering from oversold levels and has now approached a normal.  Bitcoin -1.68%  is currently at a favorable point for  bullish  entries. The price broke a long term resistance as it break past the downtrend line in April, 2018. This was a big accomplishment for the bulls but the lack of confidence pulled the price back to the support line. Currently, the price is just above the support line and appears to be all set for a  bullish  comeback but the reality is, there are not enough bulls in the market. 

The past few months have been devastating for the price of  Bitcoin -1.68%  ( BTC -1.68% ) and a lot of investors are still running scared. Institutional investors are looking for more clarity regarding regulations concerning cryptocurrencies and also safer ways to invest and store their coins. As for retail investors, most of them comprise of first time investors who have never traded any financial asset before. So, when they saw that  Bitcoin -1.68%  ( BTC -1.68% ) is making 20% gains every day, they thought this could go on forever and jumped with both feet, only to find the carpet pulled under from their feet. Big investors have always played small investors as cannon fodder and have gotten away with their schemes even in regulated markets like forex or the stock market. Cryptocurrencies is a new market with no proper regulations which means it is natural to expect that those who can afford to not play by the rules, most likely won’t.

Hello friends,  

It's been a while since my last post; lack of time and an urge to do more research has mainly driven me to take a break from posting ideas on TradingView. I am still in the process of doing more research and study, but I figure posting once in a while couldn't hurt. 

Since I have become recently very convinced about this, I am outlining a very possible situation with  Bitcoin -1.69%  where the  trend line  we have been on since early October breaks, reaching around a temporary low of $5000. This is examined on the  daily chart , since this is one of the best charts to examine trends of this size. I have to first and foremost say that I am not trying to spread fear, I know many people do not like to hear  bearish  ideas, but  technical analysis  is ultimately a rational exercise, and I feel that possibilities with very strong signs should be explored. 

There are a few things to look at, but I first want to talk about the big picture with, long-term  support and resistance  lines. I think most people can agree that there was a very significant downtrending resistance line that began from the peak of the  ATH 0.63%  in late December, to the low of around $6400 (thick red line). After the break from that line, it seems we moved into a sideways trend, bouncing back and forth between an emerging downtrending resistance line (light red) and a support line that we seem to have been respecting since mid-October (light green); at least this appears to be the case with the lows, where the angle's effectiveness appears very strongly. Finally, based on previous bounces, we can establish a support of around $5000-$5300 (I've thus created a small  support zone  around that range, in dark green), as well as lower supports around $3200 and $2000 (though I do not believe these will be reached, in dark green).   

Now, onto the analysis - it's no secret that  Bitcoin -1.69%  has been squeezing in, ready for a significant move either upwards or downwards. Initially I considered the upwards move to be more likely due to the significant media attention cryptocurrency has been receiving, but after viewing previous market cycles of  Bitcoin -1.69%  (check 2013), it seems clear to me that the  bearish  scenario of closing in on the market cycle is very likely, and should at the very least be prepared for with proper risk management. According to Dow Theory, which is said to have laid the foundations of modern  technical analysis , history repeats itself, and this is a situation where we forced to consider this. 

Should we break from the line, we will likely fall straight down to the $5000-$5000 area, where we will shoot back up and bounce towards around $6700 or so (maybe a little less). From there one, we will likely enter a sideways trend, which we will continue until we see higher highs and higher lows and parabolic movement returns, which could lead to us challenging the all-time high, and hitting $35k-$50k. 

NOTE: I seem to have reached the max character limit for this section of the idea, so I will continue my text below.

Comment:
					Onto the short-term: 


Scenario A: 

The reason why I have drawn this movement into a pennant is this way, is simply because we have been moving through this ascending triangle for quite a while now (May 23rd to today). I don't think that the pattern will be sufficient to directly lead into a strong sell-off, but we should consider that the size of ascending triangle suggests a small movement downwards at the very least, which can create a higher low, and thus move into position into a bearish pennant. Why would a bearish pennant occur here and not have a bounce to $8500-$8700? The reason is in positioning - the huge downtrend (May 5th to May 26th) creates a very nice flagpole in which it hits around the $5000 area very perfectly, and thus I would not be surprised if this happens. 

Second reason: on the Stoch RSI indicator on the daily chart, it appears to be dangerously high, which would suggest it being oversold. For the most part, it seems to have called lows and highs, at least to some extent. This overdrawn movement may very well have increased the likelyhood of Bitcoin being oversold. This could suggest that this is the last step into a sharp downturn, but this does not preclude Situation B. Volume has also been steadily decreasing, but this is the case with any sort of consolidation, I believe. 

Finally, the lines I have drawn below the triangle are simply bounces that I think seem fairly reasonable. The length from to support to the lines correlate with the length of the flagpole, of course, though it may seem chopped off due to the huge line from the long-term support downwards. 


Scenario B: 

This is much simpler, Bitcoin hits the upper resistance line, bounces off, challenges the lower support line, and we potentially see a break, and the rest unfolds from there. 


----------------------------------------------------------------------- 


With all this being said, do not fear if you are hoping for more parabolic movement - this likely will not be the end, and will simply be the set up for a long, drawn out sideways movement until the first signs of bullish activity begin and we start all over again. If you are longing around here, please consider using risk management, prepare for every possibility. If you are shorting, the same applies. 

Please trade with care. I wish the best to all traders!

Comment:
					This really is a very minor note, but I just want to emphasize that the rising wedge (which I erroneously refer to as an ascending triangle, a bad habit I have) entering a bearish pennant is more based on intuition than anything. Also, this pennant is mainly based on the conservative assumption that the break will happen at 7900, if it happens at 7700 where we seem to be general resistance, the pennant would look something like this:

I am Mid term-bullish on  BTC -1.69%  going into the end of this week, but looking to get into the market on a pull back to occur before I get in to the market.  The jury is still out as to whether this weekly bear trend is ready to turn around.  

We can see that both the  RSI  and  MFI  are both  Bullish  on the daily having bottomed when reaching oversold on both at c. $7k support where we found our longer term  trend line . 

We are currently in the process of meeting the Tenkan (blue line) as I write this, so in the very short term, I am looking for a pull back to $7550 range for an entry.  One of the main reasons for this is that on the 4hour timeframes we are close to completing an edge to edge trade so the risk reward doesn’t fit my profile, however a break out from the cloud or above the Tenkan around $7777 will make me enter the market. 

The  RSI  and  MFI  have both been excellent indicators in this bear market.  Whenever  RSI  has gone above the 60 and the  MFI  80; its time to exit the market from a  bullish  trade and consider shorting as it progresses higher.   

Based on the  RSI ,  MFI  trends and the fact that we will run into the Kijun at just around $8-8.2k, I will be scalling out at this  bearish  confluence level to start looking for pull backs and reassessment as i believe it to be a key point as  

Best case scenario this trade would yield a 10% return before leverage. 
This is for illustrative purposes only, please DYOR and goodluck with your trading.

So the pullback trade that we were looking at worked out & has made it's way back to the neckline level of structure. We are now at what i like to call a ""decision point"" Essentially IF price is able to violate this current level od structure THEN we're likely to continue to our next price projection.  

Something that a lot of newer traders don't understand is that when it comes to bigger moves, the market will often provide multiple opportunities to get involved. For those who don't rush and for those who don't get discouraged. If you perform consistent analysis you can often find multiple ways to involve yourself in a trade even if you missed the first strike.

This is the way markets move, If you question my charting check my previous posts. Its as simple as pie. We are going down, How long and how far is too soon to say. Here is a chart that we can understand the future price action and where to buy back. Before you guys start blasting my comment section with the time and how it may not be right thats correct. I am not calculating the time I'm just making a technical drawing of the directions that we will see in the next few months.  

Recent price action has clear signs of wash trading / market manipulation fud and lots of nonsense. Its hard to prove almost impossible so as a trader we just need to deal with it. Ideally the situation you are supposed to trade are critical break up and break down points to enter the trade. Dont enter or exit dumb trades and lose money. As an experienced trader you should be looking for shorts, I would not consider a long unless we are over $10-12k

I am never good with words so instead of writing paragraphs of clarification to justify my call for SHORT since my last posting, I have explained everything on my chart with the least words possible using Fibonacci. It does not matter how popular  Bitcoin -1.72%  has become, or how deep it has disrupted the financial sector, or how many institutional investors have come to invest in it -- the psychology behind a market cycle does not change. 

I don't really encourage anyone to short  Bitcoin -1.72% , but in all honesty, don't expect the bulls to fly anytime soon. Like I said before, this correction that we are having right now is the ""MOTHER OF ALL CORRECTIONS"" after a 4-year-long bull cycle since the 2013 correction... and we are just halfway through.

My best idea ever, taking some time off the last 2 days :) The whales just continue to play their little games by squeezing leveraged short and long positions out of the market. Can't play them, it's just too easy. Maybe it's time we retail traders stand together, combine our  volume  and use their own game against them. Yeah, maybe we could even make a blockbuster movie about this :) I love me some science fiction :) LOL  

My last update of the previous analysis i showed 2 important support levels where the price could bounce up from. The first support around 7350 did the trick and the price got pushed back to 7700. From that point on i told my members that i thought i was seeing distribution, but it was still very confusing to figure out what was going on. TA was showing  bullish  signs, that  bull flag  was very strong and was even turning slowly up and was about to squeeze upwards. But of course out of no where the price got dumped, the move we saw a few hours ago. After that 200 point drop the price got pushed up again to 7700 like that dump was a glitch. If your a whale, why not push out leveraged traders and take your money while your accumulating or distributing. It's like a bonus, like the cherry on top :)  

Anyway, in this chart we can see allot of similarities of what is going on. As you know i have been saying i am still  bearish  for the medium term, but i just could not say what was going to happen on the short term. 2 days ago after we finally dropped out of that  wedge , i said we would have 2 options.  
- Break those 2 support levels from the last update of my previous chart (73xx and 71xx) 
- Make a higher low at those same support levels and make another move up above the high.  
 
As we can see in the chart, the  fractal  is not 100% identical so it's no guarantee that the 7700 high we just saw is the high already and that we start to move down. But based on this  fractal , i don't want to see the price get above the 7800/7900. This  fractal  confirms my  bearish  view as well. That's why TA is so great, you can turn any chart to fit your view :). 

Even without this  fractal , i just give it a very small chance that 7K price action is the fundament of a low to start another bull rally, i just highly doubt that. I want to see more  volume  to begin with and at least  double bottom  kind of formation. So the minimum i expect is a test of the 7100/6900in the coming week or 2. But the movement i have in mind for the med term is a drop below the 7K to form a big V shape low. If we get to see that, than i might even become  bullish  for the rest of the year :).  

As long as the price stays above the 73xx, we have to assume the bulls are still in control and we should see another wave up. So for me the 73xx is an important turning point.

Comment:
					This is my bigger picture, think this bearish triangle is still 100% in play. I think if bulls can't break the 7800/7900 the bearish version is probably going to happen. Can't say HOW it will go, this blue line is just a guess. But a big V shape low would be the most bullish for the long term. I still think we are seeing distribution here. The only way this idea can be countered, is through a big increase of buying volume, if that doesn't happen, i think it's only a matter of time.

					What a surprise, nothing has changed :) 

The price took a small dump but the volume was low so no real read on what the intent was. So we might see another move up, if we start to see a small pump that takes out the 7800, be aware of a fake breakout. The blue line is a possibility of what the move could look like IF we move up and if the breakout fails. If that happens than we will probably get confirmation if the price breaks the 7600ish. If we break the 7800 it should stay above the 7700 to confirm another move up. Not much more to say about what's going on.

Comment:
					So we have made a small drop, but there is no volume confirming it, not yet at least. First small support has been broken, but not yet very meaningful because of the low volume. For the ones who shorted it, just be aware of another squeeze up, since this small move downwards looks a bit to controlled.  

Pure TA, it broke the channel and retested the former support as resistance now.

793,1528359434.0,Taiwan_Bear,2618 (Double top & 0.618 pull-back) - do not miss it!!,"
In the last couple of TAs I have mentioned the “2618 pattern” and have been asked what 2618 means. Sorry for taking it so long as it took me quite a while to put everything altogether. But, as promised, I have explained below the rules and trade setups for the 2618 pattern.  

What are the rules/setups/steps for 2618?  
1.	Form a  double top  (Note #1)  
2.	Neckline has to be broken  
3.	After price found support at point (b), wait for pull back to 0.618 fib retracement of (a)(b)  
4.	After price retraced to 0.618, look for confluence and sell (eg. Structures,  trendlines  ,  double top  on a lower time frame,  rsi  divergence,  bearish pin bar  ,  inside bar  break down etc.) (Note #2)  
5.	Stop loss to be set above  double top 
6.	Set Take Profit levels (Note #3)  

Note #1 ( Double top ):  
The first step for the formation of 2618 is to form a  double top  at key resistance levels. Why at key resistance levels? Because we want to avoid fake double tops which can occur occasionally.  

There are some variations between various resources (books, websites) regarding the definitions of “double top”. The main differences occur where:  
a)	Some said for a  double top  to be valid, the wick of the 2nd top cannot exceed the wick of the 1st top; whereas, others said:  
b)	The wick of the 2nd top can exceed the wick of the 1st top but the candle close of the 2nd top CANNOT exceed the wick of the 1st top; or  
c)	The wick of the 2nd top can exceed the wick of the 1st top and the candle close of the 2nd top CAN exceed the wick of the 1st top; or  
d)	The wick of the 2nd top meets at least the candle close of the 1st top; or  
e)	The body of the 2nd top cannot exceed the body of the 1st top  

Personally, I would say all the above definitions work just fine although I do prefer definition a) because it means that the selling pressure is strong and the bulls fail to make a higher high. When there is a higher high formed in a downtrend, it can mean the downtrend has reversed and therefore you might not want to sell when the price pulls back to the 0.618 fib retracement.  

Note #2 ( 0.618 retracement ):  
When the price pulls back to 0.618, it does not mean to sell straight away. There must be more than one reason to sell other than the 0.618 retrace. The more reasons the better. In this example, you can see there are certainly structures (key resistance levels) at the 0.618 retrace. As well, there was a  double top  formed on the lower time frame. Consequently, you can sell.  

After  BTC -1.73%  hit the 0.618 retrace the first time, the price dropped from $9735 to $8650. but quickly bounced back to the 0.618 retrace level. That was a second & better opportunity to sell. Not only did  BTC -1.73%  form a  double top  on the larger time frame, but also with a  bearish  divergence on the 4hr time frame. Accordingly, you have more reasons to sell.  

Note #3 (Set take profit)  
Same as the rules of “Double top”, there are some variations as to which price level should you take profits. Personally, I would stick to the below:  
1)	First, take profit when risk/reward ratio hits 1:1 (recommend to take 30% - 50% profits and adjust the SL of the remaining positions to break-even)  
2)	When price hits the same price level as the low after the neckline is broken ((b) point in this example)  
3)	When price hits 1.272 fib extension of (a)(b)  
4)	When price hits point (d) (using  AB=CD  pattern. If you are not sure what the rules of  AB=CD  are, you can refer to my previous TA in which I have attached the link below)  
5)	If in a one-way market (heavily bearish/bullish), you can always keep 10% to 20% of your positions and take profits when risk/reward ratio hits 1:5 or even 1:10

 BTC -1.73%  is on the verge of breaking to a daily higher high on the bounce if the bulls can see a push this morning. 
If we reject from here the daily will form a lower high and we will see a tightening pattern within the highlighted  support and resistance  lines.  
Important for the bulls to show up or we could stay in this range into tomorrow.  
Healthy consolidation after the most recent bull move and the 15 min chart needs to change the trend.  
Also look to  EMA  12 support on the 4 hour and hourly.  
Another morning like yesterday with the bulls comfortable as worst case, we likely stay in the tightening pattern if bulls cannot prove themselves.

The current situation of  Bitcoin -1.73%  is quite difficult. We are on a clear treshold. A lot of traders are saying that we are on a clear downtrend, but the same amount of people are claiming that we will have our reversal soon. 

This article tries to sum up all important information you have to need! 

1: Retracement of a parabolic uptrend: 
There is a rule of thumb for the retracement of a parabolic uptrend. We should retrace to approx. the 0.786  Fibonacci Retracement  +/- 10%! 
Depending where we start the count, we are already in that target. Although both ways (blue and red) have still some space for a further downwave! 







2: The bloody support of Bitcoin: 
The average cost of mining one  bitcoin -1.73%  are at USA/Russia approx. 4700$ and at 3100$ for china! 
A drop below a target of 4700$ would be savage. Nevertheless, i can't image that we will hit that target. 







3: Manipulation of  Bitcoin -1.73%  and the Bart Simpson Pattern: 
A friend of mine found some unusual patterns in the orderbooks of several exchanges: 
https://twitter.com/CryptoSyndrome 
Altcoins are manipulated on a daily basis. It seems that  bitcoin -1.73%  is now affected to this too, which causes all these 3-5% pump and dumps. 
Thus, we are forming all the time the Bartin Simpsons Patterns. 

4: Similarity to 2014: 
Bitcoin -1.73%  now: 






Bitcoin -1.73%  2014: 







5: Deminishing downtrend and a strong support 
If we see the falling  wedges  as the force of the downtrend, then the force is diminishing! 
Furthermore we have strong support which is holding now for the 4th time! 







6: The Indicators 
Having a look at the indicators at 2D, we have a good potential for an upwave now. 
The  volume  is deminishing which should indicate a breakout soon. 
The  MACD  is about to cross, the  RSI  was slightly overbought and is heading up like the  Stoch .  RSI . 
The 200  EMA  is slighty under the current price and act as a support. 

7: The symetrical Triangle 
The theory says, that we should have in a  sym -1.72% . triangle 5 times an  ABC  wave. The waves are not perfect, but we can construct them. 






As you can see, the last four ABC-Waves formed always a 1:1 extention, which indicates that we have finished wave 5. 

8: A possible Head and Shoulders 
Even if this is not the most perfect  Head and Shoulders  Pattern, it's still valid! 
We are currently at the neckline, which is a strong and important resistance. Breaking upwards should indicate a good uptrend. 







9: The magic  6th 0.00%  of the month 






Suprisingly we have on every  6th 0.00%  of the month a reversal. Why is that??? 
One reason could be the  CME Group Futures  with dates for the settlements always nearby the  6th 0.00%  of the month! 
http://www.cmegroup.com 

10: Longterm  Bullish  TA 
The whole pattern could be seen as a big  bullish pennant . 







11: Shortterm  Bullish  TA 
Leading diagonal  starting wave1 of an  Elliott Wave , since we have now an impulse wave, after the 5x  ABC  pattern inside the triangle is finished. 
Our target should be at the top of the triangle nearby 8600-8800$. 







12: Longterm  Bearish  TA 
We also can argue, that we are currenty in an downtrend and the  sym -1.72% . triangle just continuing the trend. 
Our target should be nearby 6000$ which is also a finished downwards  Elliott Wave .

Nothing is happening in the market:  volatility  has become extinct and coins' trading fallen out of fashion. Range-bound bots and robotic humans absolutely prosper in this environment. The price was unable to break the 7700 threshold. For me this is a  bearish  signal. Indicators provide mixed signals, so let's examine wave structure. The move from May 29 is a  3-wave -0.12%  correction within a larger downtrend. A price drop below 7500 would confirm this scenario.

Comment:
					Impulse Wave Truncation (Truncated Fifth) - 
Truncated 5th wave is when the market has become so over-extended in Wave 3 that there is not much force left for the impulse wave to come to a proper completion. So when this happens, there is a chance that the last wave of the impulse, Wave 5, will not reach the end of Wave 3 before the market starts correcting in the opposite direction. At this point, the market is just too exhausted. This condition is often called a “failure” or a “Truncation.”

I can see many people still believe that we are going inside a  descending triangle . I also believed this in my idea that i shard on may 1st: 



 

Things can change so quickly and if we didn't adapt to the changes then someone will. That's why i believe that we have to be in fast adapt mode in this market. Doesn't mean that you need to change without checking yourself. I try to find 2-3 confirmations before i change my idea on something. This includes pattern changes, trend changes etc 

There are 21 corrective wave patterns in EW which is categorized into major 3 corrective wave patterns: 

Zigzag  (5-3-5) 
Flat (3-3-5) 
Triangle (3-3-3-3-3) 

And other patterns are combinations of the above which is:  

Double three (A combination of two corrective patterns above) 
Triple three (A combination of three corrective patterns above) 

So what i can see now is that we are in two double three combination corrective wave pattern: 








More info here:  

https://elliottwave-forecast.com/elliott-wave-theory/#corrective-waves 

Confirmations: 

1. Wave ((i)) of C is 1.6k and ((v)) is going to be completed below the triangle 
2. Wave (E) of the triangle can't go beyond the triangle.  
3. This has happened twice before in 2013 & 2015 

Each wave  got 3 subwaves (a,b &c) inside and we are in the subwave c of ((y)) of Y which is an impulsive wave. 

Impulsive waves: 1,3,5,a,c 
Corrective waves: 2,4,b 

Normal Fibo Ratios for these waves are: 

wave 2 = 0.5 - 0.8 of wave 1  
wave 3 = 1.236 - 1.618 of wave 1  
wave 4 = 0.5 - 0.618 of wave 3  
wave 5 = 0.618 - 1 of wave 1  
wave B = 0.5 - 0.8 of wave A  
wave C = 0.618 - 1.236 of wave A  

Now if you check what happened in subwave a of ((y)) of Y you can see that: 

Wave (i) of a: 985$ 
Wave (ii) of a: 434$  
Wave ( iii -0.46% ) of a: 1207$  
Wave (iv) of a: 691$ [~0.618 of Wave ( iii -0.46% )] 
Wave (v) of a: 950$  








I have seen  BTC -1.73%  impulsive waves fibo ratios almost the same as the previous impulsive wave fibo ratios. 
Now if you apply the same for the last wave C of (E) this is what you get: 

Wave ((i)) of c: 1587$ 
Wave ((ii)) of c  = 793$ 
Wave (( iii -0.46% )) of c  = 1961$ 
Wave ((iv)) of c [~0.618 of Wave (( iii -0.46% ))] = 1212$ 
Wave ((v)) of c  = 1587$ 








Also note that Wave ((iv)) might not retrace upto 0.618 of Wave (( iii -0.46% )) as everyone will be in panic mode by that time so minimum retracement would be around 0.386 of Wave (( iii -0.46% )) which is around 756$ and this is why i can see it goes down to 5k level or little bit more towards 4.7k which is the lowest level of the  support zone  (orange dotted lines) 








So 3 Possible Support lines for reversal would be 

1. Blue: 5800 - 6100 (Only possible if Wave ((v)) is truncated) 
2. Orange: 4700 - 5000 (This is most likely where we heading)  
3. Red: 4100 - 4400 (Only possible if Wave (( iii -0.46% )) is extended)

 Bitcoin -1.73%  has recently developed an interesting pattern of completing a  bullish  and  bearish  cycle on the sixth of every month in an alternating order. As we can see in the chart above, a fall is followed by a rise. This has happened twice before and is expected to happen again now on the  6th 0.00%  of June, 2018. This time  Bitcoin -1.73%  will finish a  bearish  cycle and I expected to begin the next  bullish  cycle at least till the end of  6th 0.00%  of July, 2018. 

This pattern of rise and fall is also supported by other patterns on the chart that signal a  bullish  reversal. The support line has also held firmly and if this pattern of alternating rise and fall ensues,  Bitcoin -1.73%  could very well make new highs by the end of the year. The  RSI  is recovering from oversold levels and has now approached a normal.  Bitcoin -1.73%  is currently at a favorable point for  bullish  entries. The price broke a long term resistance as it break past the downtrend line in April, 2018. This was a big accomplishment for the bulls but the lack of confidence pulled the price back to the support line. Currently, the price is just above the support line and appears to be all set for a  bullish  comeback but the reality is, there are not enough bulls in the market. 

The past few months have been devastating for the price of  Bitcoin -1.73%  ( BTC -1.73% ) and a lot of investors are still running scared. Institutional investors are looking for more clarity regarding regulations concerning cryptocurrencies and also safer ways to invest and store their coins. As for retail investors, most of them comprise of first time investors who have never traded any financial asset before. So, when they saw that  Bitcoin -1.73%  ( BTC -1.73% ) is making 20% gains every day, they thought this could go on forever and jumped with both feet, only to find the carpet pulled under from their feet. Big investors have always played small investors as cannon fodder and have gotten away with their schemes even in regulated markets like forex or the stock market. Cryptocurrencies is a new market with no proper regulations which means it is natural to expect that those who can afford to not play by the rules, most likely won’t.

Hello friends,  

It's been a while since my last post; lack of time and an urge to do more research has mainly driven me to take a break from posting ideas on TradingView. I am still in the process of doing more research and study, but I figure posting once in a while couldn't hurt. 

Since I have become recently very convinced about this, I am outlining a very possible situation with  Bitcoin -1.73%  where the  trend line  we have been on since early October breaks, reaching around a temporary low of $5000. This is examined on the  daily chart , since this is one of the best charts to examine trends of this size. I have to first and foremost say that I am not trying to spread fear, I know many people do not like to hear  bearish  ideas, but  technical analysis  is ultimately a rational exercise, and I feel that possibilities with very strong signs should be explored. 

There are a few things to look at, but I first want to talk about the big picture with, long-term  support and resistance  lines. I think most people can agree that there was a very significant downtrending resistance line that began from the peak of the  ATH 0.63%  in late December, to the low of around $6400 (thick red line). After the break from that line, it seems we moved into a sideways trend, bouncing back and forth between an emerging downtrending resistance line (light red) and a support line that we seem to have been respecting since mid-October (light green); at least this appears to be the case with the lows, where the angle's effectiveness appears very strongly. Finally, based on previous bounces, we can establish a support of around $5000-$5300 (I've thus created a small  support zone  around that range, in dark green), as well as lower supports around $3200 and $2000 (though I do not believe these will be reached, in dark green).   

Now, onto the analysis - it's no secret that  Bitcoin -1.73%  has been squeezing in, ready for a significant move either upwards or downwards. Initially I considered the upwards move to be more likely due to the significant media attention cryptocurrency has been receiving, but after viewing previous market cycles of  Bitcoin -1.73%  (check 2013), it seems clear to me that the  bearish  scenario of closing in on the market cycle is very likely, and should at the very least be prepared for with proper risk management. According to Dow Theory, which is said to have laid the foundations of modern  technical analysis , history repeats itself, and this is a situation where we forced to consider this. 

Should we break from the line, we will likely fall straight down to the $5000-$5000 area, where we will shoot back up and bounce towards around $6700 or so (maybe a little less). From there one, we will likely enter a sideways trend, which we will continue until we see higher highs and higher lows and parabolic movement returns, which could lead to us challenging the all-time high, and hitting $35k-$50k. 

NOTE: I seem to have reached the max character limit for this section of the idea, so I will continue my text below.

Comment:
					Onto the short-term: 


Scenario A: 

The reason why I have drawn this movement into a pennant is this way, is simply because we have been moving through this ascending triangle for quite a while now (May 23rd to today). I don't think that the pattern will be sufficient to directly lead into a strong sell-off, but we should consider that the size of ascending triangle suggests a small movement downwards at the very least, which can create a higher low, and thus move into position into a bearish pennant. Why would a bearish pennant occur here and not have a bounce to $8500-$8700? The reason is in positioning - the huge downtrend (May 5th to May 26th) creates a very nice flagpole in which it hits around the $5000 area very perfectly, and thus I would not be surprised if this happens. 

Second reason: on the Stoch RSI indicator on the daily chart, it appears to be dangerously high, which would suggest it being oversold. For the most part, it seems to have called lows and highs, at least to some extent. This overdrawn movement may very well have increased the likelyhood of Bitcoin being oversold. This could suggest that this is the last step into a sharp downturn, but this does not preclude Situation B. Volume has also been steadily decreasing, but this is the case with any sort of consolidation, I believe. 

Finally, the lines I have drawn below the triangle are simply bounces that I think seem fairly reasonable. The length from to support to the lines correlate with the length of the flagpole, of course, though it may seem chopped off due to the huge line from the long-term support downwards. 


Scenario B: 

This is much simpler, Bitcoin hits the upper resistance line, bounces off, challenges the lower support line, and we potentially see a break, and the rest unfolds from there. 


----------------------------------------------------------------------- 


With all this being said, do not fear if you are hoping for more parabolic movement - this likely will not be the end, and will simply be the set up for a long, drawn out sideways movement until the first signs of bullish activity begin and we start all over again. If you are longing around here, please consider using risk management, prepare for every possibility. If you are shorting, the same applies. 

Please trade with care. I wish the best to all traders!

Comment:
					This really is a very minor note, but I just want to emphasize that the rising wedge (which I erroneously refer to as an ascending triangle, a bad habit I have) entering a bearish pennant is more based on intuition than anything. Also, this pennant is mainly based on the conservative assumption that the break will happen at 7900, if it happens at 7700 where we seem to be general resistance, the pennant would look something like this:

Jun 7




I am Mid term-bullish on  BTC -1.73%  going into the end of this week, but looking to get into the market on a pull back to occur before I get in to the market.  The jury is still out as to whether this weekly bear trend is ready to turn around.  

We can see that both the  RSI  and  MFI  are both  Bullish  on the daily having bottomed when reaching oversold on both at c. $7k support where we found our longer term  trend line . 

We are currently in the process of meeting the Tenkan (blue line) as I write this, so in the very short term, I am looking for a pull back to $7550 range for an entry.  One of the main reasons for this is that on the 4hour timeframes we are close to completing an edge to edge trade so the risk reward doesn’t fit my profile, however a break out from the cloud or above the Tenkan around $7777 will make me enter the market. 

The  RSI  and  MFI  have both been excellent indicators in this bear market.  Whenever  RSI  has gone above the 60 and the  MFI  80; its time to exit the market from a  bullish  trade and consider shorting as it progresses higher.   

Based on the  RSI ,  MFI  trends and the fact that we will run into the Kijun at just around $8-8.2k, I will be scalling out at this  bearish  confluence level to start looking for pull backs and reassessment as i believe it to be a key point as  

Best case scenario this trade would yield a 10% return before leverage. 
This is for illustrative purposes only, please DYOR and goodluck with your trading.

So the pullback trade that we were looking at worked out & has made it's way back to the neckline level of structure. We are now at what i like to call a ""decision point"" Essentially IF price is able to violate this current level od structure THEN we're likely to continue to our next price projection.  

Something that a lot of newer traders don't understand is that when it comes to bigger moves, the market will often provide multiple opportunities to get involved. For those who don't rush and for those who don't get discouraged. If you perform consistent analysis you can often find multiple ways to involve yourself in a trade even if you missed the first strike.

Recent price action has clear signs of wash trading / market manipulation fud and lots of nonsense. Its hard to prove almost impossible so as a trader we just need to deal with it. Ideally the situation you are supposed to trade are critical break up and break down points to enter the trade. Dont enter or exit dumb trades and lose money.

I am never good with words so instead of writing paragraphs of clarification to justify my call for SHORT since my last posting, I have explained everything on my chart with the least words possible using Fibonacci. It does not matter how popular  Bitcoin -1.74%  has become, or how deep it has disrupted the financial sector, or how many institutional investors have come to invest in it -- the psychology behind a market cycle does not change. 

I don't really encourage anyone to short  Bitcoin -1.74% , but in all honesty, don't expect the bulls to fly anytime soon.

My best idea ever, taking some time off the last 2 days :) The whales just continue to play their little games by squeezing leveraged short and long positions out of the market. Can't play them, it's just too easy. Maybe it's time we retail traders stand together, combine our  volume  and use their own game against them. Yeah, maybe we could even make a blockbuster movie about this :) I love me some science fiction :) LOL  

My last update of the previous analysis i showed 2 important support levels where the price could bounce up from. The first support around 7350 did the trick and the price got pushed back to 7700. From that point on i told my members that i thought i was seeing distribution, but it was still very confusing to figure out what was going on. TA was showing  bullish  signs, that  bull flag  was very strong and was even turning slowly up and was about to squeeze upwards. But of course out of no where the price got dumped, the move we saw a few hours ago. After that 200 point drop the price got pushed up again to 7700 like that dump was a glitch. If your a whale, why not push out leveraged traders and take your money while your accumulating or distributing. It's like a bonus, like the cherry on top :)  

Anyway, in this chart we can see allot of similarities of what is going on. As you know i have been saying i am still  bearish  for the medium term, but i just could not say what was going to happen on the short term. 2 days ago after we finally dropped out of that  wedge , i said we would have 2 options.  
- Break those 2 support levels from the last update of my previous chart (73xx and 71xx) 
- Make a higher low at those same support levels and make another move up above the high.  
 
As we can see in the chart, the  fractal  is not 100% identical so it's no guarantee that the 7700 high we just saw is the high already and that we start to move down. But based on this  fractal , i don't want to see the price get above the 7800/7900. This  fractal  confirms my  bearish  view as well. That's why TA is so great, you can turn any chart to fit your view :). 

Even without this  fractal , i just give it a very small chance that 7K price action is the fundament of a low to start another bull rally, i just highly doubt that. I want to see more  volume  to begin with and at least  double bottom  kind of formation. So the minimum i expect is a test of the 7100/6900in the coming week or 2. But the movement i have in mind for the med term is a drop below the 7K to form a big V shape low. If we get to see that, than i might even become  bullish  for the rest of the year :).  

As long as the price stays above the 73xx, we have to assume the bulls are still in control and we should see another wave up. So for me the 73xx is an important turning point.

					This is my bigger picture, think this bearish triangle is still 100% in play. I think if bulls can't break the 7800/7900 the bearish version is probably going to happen. Can't say HOW it will go, this blue line is just a guess. But a big V shape low would be the most bullish for the long term. I still think we are seeing distribution here. The only way this idea can be countered, is through a big increase of buying volume, if that doesn't happen, i think it's only a matter of time.

					What a surprise, nothing has changed :) 

The price took a small dump but the volume was low so no real read on what the intent was. So we might see another move up, if we start to see a small pump that takes out the 7800, be aware of a fake breakout. The blue line is a possibility of what the move could look like IF we move up and if the breakout fails. If that happens than we will probably get confirmation if the price breaks the 7600ish. If we break the 7800 it should stay above the 7700 to confirm another move up. Not much more to say about what's going on.

					So we have made a small drop, but there is no volume confirming it, not yet at least. First small support has been broken, but not yet very meaningful because of the low volume. For the ones who shorted it, just be aware of another squeeze up, since this small move downwards looks a bit to controlled.  

Pure TA, it broke the channel and retested the former support as resistance now.

811,1528359434.0,Taiwan_Bear,2618 (Double top & 0.618 pull-back) - do not miss it!!,"
In the last couple of TAs I have mentioned the “2618 pattern” and have been asked what 2618 means. Sorry for taking it so long as it took me quite a while to put everything altogether. But, as promised, I have explained below the rules and trade setups for the 2618 pattern.  

What are the rules/setups/steps for 2618?  
1.	Form a  double top  (Note #1)  
2.	Neckline has to be broken  
3.	After price found support at point (b), wait for pull back to 0.618 fib retracement of (a)(b)  
4.	After price retraced to 0.618, look for confluence and sell (eg. Structures,  trendlines  ,  double top  on a lower time frame,  rsi  divergence,  bearish pin bar  ,  inside bar  break down etc.) (Note #2)  
5.	Stop loss to be set above  double top 
6.	Set Take Profit levels (Note #3)  

Note #1 ( Double top ):  
The first step for the formation of 2618 is to form a  double top  at key resistance levels. Why at key resistance levels? Because we want to avoid fake double tops which can occur occasionally.  

There are some variations between various resources (books, websites) regarding the definitions of “double top”. The main differences occur where:  
a)	Some said for a  double top  to be valid, the wick of the 2nd top cannot exceed the wick of the 1st top; whereas, others said:  
b)	The wick of the 2nd top can exceed the wick of the 1st top but the candle close of the 2nd top CANNOT exceed the wick of the 1st top; or  
c)	The wick of the 2nd top can exceed the wick of the 1st top and the candle close of the 2nd top CAN exceed the wick of the 1st top; or  
d)	The wick of the 2nd top meets at least the candle close of the 1st top; or  
e)	The body of the 2nd top cannot exceed the body of the 1st top  

Personally, I would say all the above definitions work just fine although I do prefer definition a) because it means that the selling pressure is strong and the bulls fail to make a higher high. When there is a higher high formed in a downtrend, it can mean the downtrend has reversed and therefore you might not want to sell when the price pulls back to the 0.618 fib retracement.  

Note #2 ( 0.618 retracement ):  
When the price pulls back to 0.618, it does not mean to sell straight away. There must be more than one reason to sell other than the 0.618 retrace. The more reasons the better. In this example, you can see there are certainly structures (key resistance levels) at the 0.618 retrace. As well, there was a  double top  formed on the lower time frame. Consequently, you can sell.  

After  BTC -1.76%  hit the 0.618 retrace the first time, the price dropped from $9735 to $8650. but quickly bounced back to the 0.618 retrace level. That was a second & better opportunity to sell. Not only did  BTC -1.76%  form a  double top  on the larger time frame, but also with a  bearish  divergence on the 4hr time frame. Accordingly, you have more reasons to sell.  

Note #3 (Set take profit)  
Same as the rules of “Double top”, there are some variations as to which price level should you take profits. Personally, I would stick to the below:  
1)	First, take profit when risk/reward ratio hits 1:1 (recommend to take 30% - 50% profits and adjust the SL of the remaining positions to break-even)  
2)	When price hits the same price level as the low after the neckline is broken ((b) point in this example)  
3)	When price hits 1.272 fib extension of (a)(b)  
4)	When price hits point (d) (using  AB=CD  pattern. If you are not sure what the rules of  AB=CD  are, you can refer to my previous TA in which I have attached the link below)  
5)	If in a one-way market (heavily bearish/bullish), you can always keep 10% to 20% of your positions and take profits when risk/reward ratio hits 1:5 or even 1:10

 BTC -1.76%  is on the verge of breaking to a daily higher high on the bounce if the bulls can see a push this morning. 
If we reject from here the daily will form a lower high and we will see a tightening pattern within the highlighted  support and resistance  lines.  
Important for the bulls to show up or we could stay in this range into tomorrow.  
Healthy consolidation after the most recent bull move and the 15 min chart needs to change the trend.  
Also look to  EMA  12 support on the 4 hour and hourly.  
Another morning like yesterday with the bulls comfortable as worst case, we likely stay in the tightening pattern if bulls cannot prove themselves.

The current situation of  Bitcoin -1.76%  is quite difficult. We are on a clear treshold. A lot of traders are saying that we are on a clear downtrend, but the same amount of people are claiming that we will have our reversal soon. 

This article tries to sum up all important information you have to need! 

1: Retracement of a parabolic uptrend: 
There is a rule of thumb for the retracement of a parabolic uptrend. We should retrace to approx. the 0.786  Fibonacci Retracement  +/- 10%! 
Depending where we start the count, we are already in that target. Although both ways (blue and red) have still some space for a further downwave! 







2: The bloody support of Bitcoin: 
The average cost of mining one  bitcoin -1.76%  are at USA/Russia approx. 4700$ and at 3100$ for china! 
A drop below a target of 4700$ would be savage. Nevertheless, i can't image that we will hit that target. 







3: Manipulation of  Bitcoin -1.76%  and the Bart Simpson Pattern: 
A friend of mine found some unusual patterns in the orderbooks of several exchanges: 
https://twitter.com/CryptoSyndrome 
Altcoins are manipulated on a daily basis. It seems that  bitcoin -1.76%  is now affected to this too, which causes all these 3-5% pump and dumps. 
Thus, we are forming all the time the Bartin Simpsons Patterns. 

4: Similarity to 2014: 
Bitcoin -1.76%  now: 






Bitcoin -1.76%  2014: 







5: Deminishing downtrend and a strong support 
If we see the falling  wedges  as the force of the downtrend, then the force is diminishing! 
Furthermore we have strong support which is holding now for the 4th time! 







6: The Indicators 
Having a look at the indicators at 2D, we have a good potential for an upwave now. 
The  volume  is deminishing which should indicate a breakout soon. 
The  MACD  is about to cross, the  RSI  was slightly overbought and is heading up like the  Stoch .  RSI . 
The 200  EMA  is slighty under the current price and act as a support. 

7: The symetrical Triangle 
The theory says, that we should have in a  sym -1.72% . triangle 5 times an  ABC  wave. The waves are not perfect, but we can construct them. 






As you can see, the last four ABC-Waves formed always a 1:1 extention, which indicates that we have finished wave 5. 

8: A possible Head and Shoulders 
Even if this is not the most perfect  Head and Shoulders  Pattern, it's still valid! 
We are currently at the neckline, which is a strong and important resistance. Breaking upwards should indicate a good uptrend. 







9: The magic  6th 0.00%  of the month 






Suprisingly we have on every  6th 0.00%  of the month a reversal. Why is that??? 
One reason could be the  CME Group Futures  with dates for the settlements always nearby the  6th 0.00%  of the month! 
http://www.cmegroup.com 

10: Longterm  Bullish  TA 
The whole pattern could be seen as a big  bullish pennant . 







11: Shortterm  Bullish  TA 
Leading diagonal  starting wave1 of an  Elliott Wave , since we have now an impulse wave, after the 5x  ABC  pattern inside the triangle is finished. 
Our target should be at the top of the triangle nearby 8600-8800$. 







12: Longterm  Bearish  TA 
We also can argue, that we are currenty in an downtrend and the  sym -1.72% . triangle just continuing the trend. 
Our target should be nearby 6000$ which is also a finished downwards  Elliott Wave .

Nothing is happening in the market:  volatility  has become extinct and coins' trading fallen out of fashion. Range-bound bots and robotic humans absolutely prosper in this environment. The price was unable to break the 7700 threshold. For me this is a  bearish  signal. Indicators provide mixed signals, so let's examine wave structure. The move from May 29 is a  3-wave -0.12%  correction within a larger downtrend. A price drop below 7500 would confirm this scenario.

					Impulse Wave Truncation (Truncated Fifth) - 
Truncated 5th wave is when the market has become so over-extended in Wave 3 that there is not much force left for the impulse wave to come to a proper completion. So when this happens, there is a chance that the last wave of the impulse, Wave 5, will not reach the end of Wave 3 before the market starts correcting in the opposite direction. At this point, the market is just too exhausted. This condition is often called a “failure” or a “Truncation.”

I can see many people still believe that we are going inside a  descending triangle . I also believed this in my idea that i shard on may 1st: 



 

Things can change so quickly and if we didn't adapt to the changes then someone will. That's why i believe that we have to be in fast adapt mode in this market. Doesn't mean that you need to change without checking yourself. I try to find 2-3 confirmations before i change my idea on something. This includes pattern changes, trend changes etc 

There are 21 corrective wave patterns in EW which is categorized into major 3 corrective wave patterns: 

Zigzag  (5-3-5) 
Flat (3-3-5) 
Triangle (3-3-3-3-3) 

And other patterns are combinations of the above which is:  

Double three (A combination of two corrective patterns above) 
Triple three (A combination of three corrective patterns above) 

So what i can see now is that we are in two double three combination corrective wave pattern: 








More info here:  

https://elliottwave-forecast.com/elliott-wave-theory/#corrective-waves 

Confirmations: 

1. Wave ((i)) of C is 1.6k and ((v)) is going to be completed below the triangle 
2. Wave (E) of the triangle can't go beyond the triangle.  
3. This has happened twice before in 2013 & 2015 

Each wave  got 3 subwaves (a,b &c) inside and we are in the subwave c of ((y)) of Y which is an impulsive wave. 

Impulsive waves: 1,3,5,a,c 
Corrective waves: 2,4,b 

Normal Fibo Ratios for these waves are: 

wave 2 = 0.5 - 0.8 of wave 1  
wave 3 = 1.236 - 1.618 of wave 1  
wave 4 = 0.5 - 0.618 of wave 3  
wave 5 = 0.618 - 1 of wave 1  
wave B = 0.5 - 0.8 of wave A  
wave C = 0.618 - 1.236 of wave A  

Now if you check what happened in subwave a of ((y)) of Y you can see that: 

Wave (i) of a: 985$ 
Wave (ii) of a: 434$  
Wave ( iii -0.48% ) of a: 1207$  
Wave (iv) of a: 691$ [~0.618 of Wave ( iii -0.48% )] 
Wave (v) of a: 950$  








I have seen  BTC -1.76%  impulsive waves fibo ratios almost the same as the previous impulsive wave fibo ratios. 
Now if you apply the same for the last wave C of (E) this is what you get: 

Wave ((i)) of c: 1587$ 
Wave ((ii)) of c  = 793$ 
Wave (( iii -0.48% )) of c  = 1961$ 
Wave ((iv)) of c [~0.618 of Wave (( iii -0.48% ))] = 1212$ 
Wave ((v)) of c  = 1587$ 








Also note that Wave ((iv)) might not retrace upto 0.618 of Wave (( iii -0.48% )) as everyone will be in panic mode by that time so minimum retracement would be around 0.386 of Wave (( iii -0.48% )) which is around 756$ and this is why i can see it goes down to 5k level or little bit more towards 4.7k which is the lowest level of the  support zone  (orange dotted lines) 








So 3 Possible Support lines for reversal would be 

1. Blue: 5800 - 6100 (Only possible if Wave ((v)) is truncated) 
2. Orange: 4700 - 5000 (This is most likely where we heading)  
3. Red: 4100 - 4400 (Only possible if Wave (( iii -0.48% )) is extended)

 Bitcoin -1.76%  has recently developed an interesting pattern of completing a  bullish  and  bearish  cycle on the sixth of every month in an alternating order. As we can see in the chart above, a fall is followed by a rise. This has happened twice before and is expected to happen again now on the  6th 0.00%  of June, 2018. This time  Bitcoin -1.76%  will finish a  bearish  cycle and I expected to begin the next  bullish  cycle at least till the end of  6th 0.00%  of July, 2018. 

This pattern of rise and fall is also supported by other patterns on the chart that signal a  bullish  reversal. The support line has also held firmly and if this pattern of alternating rise and fall ensues,  Bitcoin -1.76%  could very well make new highs by the end of the year. The  RSI  is recovering from oversold levels and has now approached a normal.  Bitcoin -1.76%  is currently at a favorable point for  bullish  entries. The price broke a long term resistance as it break past the downtrend line in April, 2018. This was a big accomplishment for the bulls but the lack of confidence pulled the price back to the support line. Currently, the price is just above the support line and appears to be all set for a  bullish  comeback but the reality is, there are not enough bulls in the market. 

The past few months have been devastating for the price of  Bitcoin -1.76%  ( BTC -1.76% ) and a lot of investors are still running scared. Institutional investors are looking for more clarity regarding regulations concerning cryptocurrencies and also safer ways to invest and store their coins. As for retail investors, most of them comprise of first time investors who have never traded any financial asset before. So, when they saw that  Bitcoin -1.76%  ( BTC -1.76% ) is making 20% gains every day, they thought this could go on forever and jumped with both feet, only to find the carpet pulled under from their feet. Big investors have always played small investors as cannon fodder and have gotten away with their schemes even in regulated markets like forex or the stock market. Cryptocurrencies is a new market with no proper regulations which means it is natural to expect that those who can afford to not play by the rules, most likely won’t.

Hello friends,  

It's been a while since my last post; lack of time and an urge to do more research has mainly driven me to take a break from posting ideas on TradingView. I am still in the process of doing more research and study, but I figure posting once in a while couldn't hurt. 

Since I have become recently very convinced about this, I am outlining a very possible situation with  Bitcoin -1.76%  where the  trend line  we have been on since early October breaks, reaching around a temporary low of $5000. This is examined on the  daily chart , since this is one of the best charts to examine trends of this size. I have to first and foremost say that I am not trying to spread fear, I know many people do not like to hear  bearish  ideas, but  technical analysis  is ultimately a rational exercise, and I feel that possibilities with very strong signs should be explored. 

There are a few things to look at, but I first want to talk about the big picture with, long-term  support and resistance  lines. I think most people can agree that there was a very significant downtrending resistance line that began from the peak of the  ATH 0.63%  in late December, to the low of around $6400 (thick red line). After the break from that line, it seems we moved into a sideways trend, bouncing back and forth between an emerging downtrending resistance line (light red) and a support line that we seem to have been respecting since mid-October (light green); at least this appears to be the case with the lows, where the angle's effectiveness appears very strongly. Finally, based on previous bounces, we can establish a support of around $5000-$5300 (I've thus created a small  support zone  around that range, in dark green), as well as lower supports around $3200 and $2000 (though I do not believe these will be reached, in dark green).   

Now, onto the analysis - it's no secret that  Bitcoin -1.76%  has been squeezing in, ready for a significant move either upwards or downwards. Initially I considered the upwards move to be more likely due to the significant media attention cryptocurrency has been receiving, but after viewing previous market cycles of  Bitcoin -1.76%  (check 2013), it seems clear to me that the  bearish  scenario of closing in on the market cycle is very likely, and should at the very least be prepared for with proper risk management. According to Dow Theory, which is said to have laid the foundations of modern  technical analysis , history repeats itself, and this is a situation where we forced to consider this. 

Should we break from the line, we will likely fall straight down to the $5000-$5000 area, where we will shoot back up and bounce towards around $6700 or so (maybe a little less). From there one, we will likely enter a sideways trend, which we will continue until we see higher highs and higher lows and parabolic movement returns, which could lead to us challenging the all-time high, and hitting $35k-$50k. 

NOTE: I seem to have reached the max character limit for this section of the idea, so I will continue my text below.

Comment:
					Onto the short-term: 


Scenario A: 

The reason why I have drawn this movement into a pennant is this way, is simply because we have been moving through this ascending triangle for quite a while now (May 23rd to today). I don't think that the pattern will be sufficient to directly lead into a strong sell-off, but we should consider that the size of ascending triangle suggests a small movement downwards at the very least, which can create a higher low, and thus move into position into a bearish pennant. Why would a bearish pennant occur here and not have a bounce to $8500-$8700? The reason is in positioning - the huge downtrend (May 5th to May 26th) creates a very nice flagpole in which it hits around the $5000 area very perfectly, and thus I would not be surprised if this happens. 

Second reason: on the Stoch RSI indicator on the daily chart, it appears to be dangerously high, which would suggest it being oversold. For the most part, it seems to have called lows and highs, at least to some extent. This overdrawn movement may very well have increased the likelyhood of Bitcoin being oversold. This could suggest that this is the last step into a sharp downturn, but this does not preclude Situation B. Volume has also been steadily decreasing, but this is the case with any sort of consolidation, I believe. 

Finally, the lines I have drawn below the triangle are simply bounces that I think seem fairly reasonable. The length from to support to the lines correlate with the length of the flagpole, of course, though it may seem chopped off due to the huge line from the long-term support downwards. 


Scenario B: 

This is much simpler, Bitcoin hits the upper resistance line, bounces off, challenges the lower support line, and we potentially see a break, and the rest unfolds from there. 


----------------------------------------------------------------------- 


With all this being said, do not fear if you are hoping for more parabolic movement - this likely will not be the end, and will simply be the set up for a long, drawn out sideways movement until the first signs of bullish activity begin and we start all over again. If you are longing around here, please consider using risk management, prepare for every possibility. If you are shorting, the same applies. 

Please trade with care. I wish the best to all traders!

Comment:
					This really is a very minor note, but I just want to emphasize that the rising wedge (which I erroneously refer to as an ascending triangle, a bad habit I have) entering a bearish pennant is more based on intuition than anything. Also, this pennant is mainly based on the conservative assumption that the break will happen at 7900, if it happens at 7700 where we seem to be general resistance, the pennant would look something like this:

Jun 7




I am Mid term-bullish on  BTC -1.76%  going into the end of this week, but looking to get into the market on a pull back to occur before I get in to the market.  The jury is still out as to whether this weekly bear trend is ready to turn around.  

We can see that both the  RSI  and  MFI  are both  Bullish  on the daily having bottomed when reaching oversold on both at c. $7k support where we found our longer term  trend line . 

We are currently in the process of meeting the Tenkan (blue line) as I write this, so in the very short term, I am looking for a pull back to $7550 range for an entry.  One of the main reasons for this is that on the 4hour timeframes we are close to completing an edge to edge trade so the risk reward doesn’t fit my profile, however a break out from the cloud or above the Tenkan around $7777 will make me enter the market. 

The  RSI  and  MFI  have both been excellent indicators in this bear market.  Whenever  RSI  has gone above the 60 and the  MFI  80; its time to exit the market from a  bullish  trade and consider shorting as it progresses higher.   

Based on the  RSI ,  MFI  trends and the fact that we will run into the Kijun at just around $8-8.2k, I will be scalling out at this  bearish  confluence level to start looking for pull backs and reassessment as i believe it to be a key point as  

Best case scenario this trade would yield a 10% return before leverage. 
This is for illustrative purposes only, please DYOR and goodluck with your trading.

So the pullback trade that we were looking at worked out & has made it's way back to the neckline level of structure. We are now at what i like to call a ""decision point"" Essentially IF price is able to violate this current level od structure THEN we're likely to continue to our next price projection.  

Something that a lot of newer traders don't understand is that when it comes to bigger moves, the market will often provide multiple opportunities to get involved. For those who don't rush and for those who don't get discouraged. If you perform consistent analysis you can often find multiple ways to involve yourself in a trade even if you missed the first strike.

Recent price action has clear signs of wash trading / market manipulation fud and lots of nonsense. Its hard to prove almost impossible so as a trader we just need to deal with it. Ideally the situation you are supposed to trade are critical break up and break down points to enter the trade. Dont enter or exit dumb trades and lose money.

I don't really encourage anyone to short  Bitcoin -1.76% , but in all honesty, don't expect the bulls to fly anytime soon.

My best idea ever, taking some time off the last 2 days :) The whales just continue to play their little games by squeezing leveraged short and long positions out of the market. Can't play them, it's just too easy. Maybe it's time we retail traders stand together, combine our  volume  and use their own game against them. Yeah, maybe we could even make a blockbuster movie about this :) I love me some science fiction :) LOL  

My last update of the previous analysis i showed 2 important support levels where the price could bounce up from. The first support around 7350 did the trick and the price got pushed back to 7700. From that point on i told my members that i thought i was seeing distribution, but it was still very confusing to figure out what was going on. TA was showing  bullish  signs, that  bull flag  was very strong and was even turning slowly up and was about to squeeze upwards. But of course out of no where the price got dumped, the move we saw a few hours ago. After that 200 point drop the price got pushed up again to 7700 like that dump was a glitch. If your a whale, why not push out leveraged traders and take your money while your accumulating or distributing. It's like a bonus, like the cherry on top :)  

Anyway, in this chart we can see allot of similarities of what is going on. As you know i have been saying i am still  bearish  for the medium term, but i just could not say what was going to happen on the short term. 2 days ago after we finally dropped out of that  wedge , i said we would have 2 options.  
- Break those 2 support levels from the last update of my previous chart (73xx and 71xx) 
- Make a higher low at those same support levels and make another move up above the high.  
 
As we can see in the chart, the  fractal  is not 100% identical so it's no guarantee that the 7700 high we just saw is the high already and that we start to move down. But based on this  fractal , i don't want to see the price get above the 7800/7900. This  fractal  confirms my  bearish  view as well. That's why TA is so great, you can turn any chart to fit your view :). 

Even without this  fractal , i just give it a very small chance that 7K price action is the fundament of a low to start another bull rally, i just highly doubt that. I want to see more  volume  to begin with and at least  double bottom  kind of formation. So the minimum i expect is a test of the 7100/6900in the coming week or 2. But the movement i have in mind for the med term is a drop below the 7K to form a big V shape low. If we get to see that, than i might even become  bullish  for the rest of the year :).  

As long as the price stays above the 73xx, we have to assume the bulls are still in control and we should see another wave up. So for me the 73xx is an important turning point.

Comment:
					At the moment it looks like bulls are trying to push higher, this bull flag/triangle is still very strong. So no sign of weakness yet! First small sign would be a drop below 7620/7600. Bulls need to break 7700

Comment:
					This is my bigger picture, think this bearish triangle is still 100% in play. I think if bulls can't break the 7800/7900 the bearish version is probably going to happen. Can't say HOW it will go, this blue line is just a guess. But a big V shape low would be the most bullish for the long term. I still think we are seeing distribution here. The only way this idea can be countered, is through a big increase of buying volume, if that doesn't happen, i think it's only a matter of time.

Comment:
					Lower time frame we can see a new upwards channel and maybe even a rising wedge. From the looks of it, it's slowly going down to test the support line again. Depending on what will happen there we can make a better prediction for the rest of the day.

Comment:
					What a surprise, nothing has changed :) 

The price took a small dump but the volume was low so no real read on what the intent was. So we might see another move up, if we start to see a small pump that takes out the 7800, be aware of a fake breakout. The blue line is a possibility of what the move could look like IF we move up and if the breakout fails. If that happens than we will probably get confirmation if the price breaks the 7600ish. If we break the 7800 it should stay above the 7700 to confirm another move up. Not much more to say about what's going on.

Comment:
					So we have made a small drop, but there is no volume confirming it, not yet at least. First small support has been broken, but not yet very meaningful because of the low volume. For the ones who shorted it, just be aware of another squeeze up, since this small move downwards looks a bit to controlled.  

Pure TA, it broke the channel and retested the former support as resistance now.

829,1528359434.0,Taiwan_Bear,2618 (Double top & 0.618 pull-back) - do not miss it!!,"
In the last couple of TAs I have mentioned the “2618 pattern” and have been asked what 2618 means. Sorry for taking it so long as it took me quite a while to put everything altogether. But, as promised, I have explained below the rules and trade setups for the 2618 pattern.  

What are the rules/setups/steps for 2618?  
1.	Form a  double top  (Note #1)  
2.	Neckline has to be broken  
3.	After price found support at point (b), wait for pull back to 0.618 fib retracement of (a)(b)  
4.	After price retraced to 0.618, look for confluence and sell (eg. Structures,  trendlines  ,  double top  on a lower time frame,  rsi  divergence,  bearish pin bar  ,  inside bar  break down etc.) (Note #2)  
5.	Stop loss to be set above  double top 
6.	Set Take Profit levels (Note #3)  

Note #1 ( Double top ):  
The first step for the formation of 2618 is to form a  double top  at key resistance levels. Why at key resistance levels? Because we want to avoid fake double tops which can occur occasionally.  

There are some variations between various resources (books, websites) regarding the definitions of “double top”. The main differences occur where:  
a)	Some said for a  double top  to be valid, the wick of the 2nd top cannot exceed the wick of the 1st top; whereas, others said:  
b)	The wick of the 2nd top can exceed the wick of the 1st top but the candle close of the 2nd top CANNOT exceed the wick of the 1st top; or  
c)	The wick of the 2nd top can exceed the wick of the 1st top and the candle close of the 2nd top CAN exceed the wick of the 1st top; or  
d)	The wick of the 2nd top meets at least the candle close of the 1st top; or  
e)	The body of the 2nd top cannot exceed the body of the 1st top  

Personally, I would say all the above definitions work just fine although I do prefer definition a) because it means that the selling pressure is strong and the bulls fail to make a higher high. When there is a higher high formed in a downtrend, it can mean the downtrend has reversed and therefore you might not want to sell when the price pulls back to the 0.618 fib retracement.  

Note #2 ( 0.618 retracement ):  
When the price pulls back to 0.618, it does not mean to sell straight away. There must be more than one reason to sell other than the 0.618 retrace. The more reasons the better. In this example, you can see there are certainly structures (key resistance levels) at the 0.618 retrace. As well, there was a  double top  formed on the lower time frame. Consequently, you can sell.  

After  BTC              hit the 0.618 retrace the first time, the price dropped from $9735 to $8650. but quickly bounced back to the 0.618 retrace level. That was a second & better opportunity to sell. Not only did  BTC              form a  double top  on the larger time frame, but also with a  bearish  divergence on the 4hr time frame. Accordingly, you have more reasons to sell.  

Note #3 (Set take profit)  
Same as the rules of “Double top”, there are some variations as to which price level should you take profits. Personally, I would stick to the below:  
1)	First, take profit when risk/reward ratio hits 1:1 (recommend to take 30% - 50% profits and adjust the SL of the remaining positions to break-even)  
2)	When price hits the same price level as the low after the neckline is broken ((b) point in this example)  
3)	When price hits 1.272 fib extension of (a)(b)  
4)	When price hits point (d) (using  AB=CD  pattern. If you are not sure what the rules of  AB=CD  are, you can refer to my previous TA in which I have attached the link below)  
5)	If in a one-way market (heavily bearish/bullish), you can always keep 10% to 20% of your positions and take profits when risk/reward ratio hits 1:5 or even 1:10

 BTC -1.76%  is on the verge of breaking to a daily higher high on the bounce if the bulls can see a push this morning. 
If we reject from here the daily will form a lower high and we will see a tightening pattern within the highlighted  support and resistance  lines.  
Important for the bulls to show up or we could stay in this range into tomorrow.  
Healthy consolidation after the most recent bull move and the 15 min chart needs to change the trend.  
Also look to  EMA  12 support on the 4 hour and hourly.  
Another morning like yesterday with the bulls comfortable as worst case, we likely stay in the tightening pattern if bulls cannot prove themselves.

The current situation of  Bitcoin -1.76%  is quite difficult. We are on a clear treshold. A lot of traders are saying that we are on a clear downtrend, but the same amount of people are claiming that we will have our reversal soon. 

This article tries to sum up all important information you have to need! 

1: Retracement of a parabolic uptrend: 
There is a rule of thumb for the retracement of a parabolic uptrend. We should retrace to approx. the 0.786  Fibonacci Retracement  +/- 10%! 
Depending where we start the count, we are already in that target. Although both ways (blue and red) have still some space for a further downwave! 







2: The bloody support of Bitcoin: 
The average cost of mining one  bitcoin -1.76%  are at USA/Russia approx. 4700$ and at 3100$ for china! 
A drop below a target of 4700$ would be savage. Nevertheless, i can't image that we will hit that target. 







3: Manipulation of  Bitcoin -1.76%  and the Bart Simpson Pattern: 
A friend of mine found some unusual patterns in the orderbooks of several exchanges: 
https://twitter.com/CryptoSyndrome 
Altcoins are manipulated on a daily basis. It seems that  bitcoin -1.76%  is now affected to this too, which causes all these 3-5% pump and dumps. 
Thus, we are forming all the time the Bartin Simpsons Patterns. 

4: Similarity to 2014: 
Bitcoin -1.76%  now: 






Bitcoin -1.76%  2014: 







5: Deminishing downtrend and a strong support 
If we see the falling  wedges  as the force of the downtrend, then the force is diminishing! 
Furthermore we have strong support which is holding now for the 4th time! 







6: The Indicators 
Having a look at the indicators at 2D, we have a good potential for an upwave now. 
The  volume  is deminishing which should indicate a breakout soon. 
The  MACD  is about to cross, the  RSI  was slightly overbought and is heading up like the  Stoch .  RSI . 
The 200  EMA  is slighty under the current price and act as a support. 

7: The symetrical Triangle 
The theory says, that we should have in a  sym -0.80% . triangle 5 times an  ABC  wave. The waves are not perfect, but we can construct them. 






As you can see, the last four ABC-Waves formed always a 1:1 extention, which indicates that we have finished wave 5. 

8: A possible Head and Shoulders 
Even if this is not the most perfect  Head and Shoulders  Pattern, it's still valid! 
We are currently at the neckline, which is a strong and important resistance. Breaking upwards should indicate a good uptrend. 







9: The magic  6th 0.00%  of the month 






Suprisingly we have on every  6th 0.00%  of the month a reversal. Why is that??? 
One reason could be the  CME Group Futures  with dates for the settlements always nearby the  6th 0.00%  of the month! 
http://www.cmegroup.com 

10: Longterm  Bullish  TA 
The whole pattern could be seen as a big  bullish pennant . 







11: Shortterm  Bullish  TA 
Leading diagonal  starting wave1 of an  Elliott Wave , since we have now an impulse wave, after the 5x  ABC  pattern inside the triangle is finished. 
Our target should be at the top of the triangle nearby 8600-8800$. 







12: Longterm  Bearish  TA 
We also can argue, that we are currenty in an downtrend and the  sym -0.80% . triangle just continuing the trend. 
Our target should be nearby 6000$ which is also a finished downwards  Elliott Wave .

Nothing is happening in the market:  volatility  has become extinct and coins' trading fallen out of fashion. Range-bound bots and robotic humans absolutely prosper in this environment. The price was unable to break the 7700 threshold. For me this is a  bearish  signal. Indicators provide mixed signals, so let's examine wave structure. The move from May 29 is a  3-wave -0.12%  correction within a larger downtrend. A price drop below 7500 would confirm this scenario.

					Impulse Wave Truncation (Truncated Fifth) - 
Truncated 5th wave is when the market has become so over-extended in Wave 3 that there is not much force left for the impulse wave to come to a proper completion. So when this happens, there is a chance that the last wave of the impulse, Wave 5, will not reach the end of Wave 3 before the market starts correcting in the opposite direction. At this point, the market is just too exhausted. This condition is often called a “failure” or a “Truncation.”

I can see many people still believe that we are going inside a  descending triangle . I also believed this in my idea that i shard on may 1st: 



 

Things can change so quickly and if we didn't adapt to the changes then someone will. That's why i believe that we have to be in fast adapt mode in this market. Doesn't mean that you need to change without checking yourself. I try to find 2-3 confirmations before i change my idea on something. This includes pattern changes, trend changes etc 

There are 21 corrective wave patterns in EW which is categorized into major 3 corrective wave patterns: 

Zigzag  (5-3-5) 
Flat (3-3-5) 
Triangle (3-3-3-3-3) 

And other patterns are combinations of the above which is:  

Double three (A combination of two corrective patterns above) 
Triple three (A combination of three corrective patterns above) 

So what i can see now is that we are in two double three combination corrective wave pattern: 








More info here:  

https://elliottwave-forecast.com/elliott-wave-theory/#corrective-waves 

Confirmations: 

1. Wave ((i)) of C is 1.6k and ((v)) is going to be completed below the triangle 
2. Wave (E) of the triangle can't go beyond the triangle.  
3. This has happened twice before in 2013 & 2015 

Each wave  got 3 subwaves (a,b &c) inside and we are in the subwave c of ((y)) of Y which is an impulsive wave. 

Impulsive waves: 1,3,5,a,c 
Corrective waves: 2,4,b 

Normal Fibo Ratios for these waves are: 

wave 2 = 0.5 - 0.8 of wave 1  
wave 3 = 1.236 - 1.618 of wave 1  
wave 4 = 0.5 - 0.618 of wave 3  
wave 5 = 0.618 - 1 of wave 1  
wave B = 0.5 - 0.8 of wave A  
wave C = 0.618 - 1.236 of wave A  

Now if you check what happened in subwave a of ((y)) of Y you can see that: 

Wave (i) of a: 985$ 
Wave (ii) of a: 434$  
Wave ( iii -0.46% ) of a: 1207$  
Wave (iv) of a: 691$ [~0.618 of Wave ( iii -0.46% )] 
Wave (v) of a: 950$  








I have seen  BTC -1.79%  impulsive waves fibo ratios almost the same as the previous impulsive wave fibo ratios. 
Now if you apply the same for the last wave C of (E) this is what you get: 

Wave ((i)) of c: 1587$ 
Wave ((ii)) of c  = 793$ 
Wave (( iii -0.46% )) of c  = 1961$ 
Wave ((iv)) of c [~0.618 of Wave (( iii -0.46% ))] = 1212$ 
Wave ((v)) of c  = 1587$ 








Also note that Wave ((iv)) might not retrace upto 0.618 of Wave (( iii -0.46% )) as everyone will be in panic mode by that time so minimum retracement would be around 0.386 of Wave (( iii -0.46% )) which is around 756$ and this is why i can see it goes down to 5k level or little bit more towards 4.7k which is the lowest level of the  support zone  (orange dotted lines) 








So 3 Possible Support lines for reversal would be 

1. Blue: 5800 - 6100 (Only possible if Wave ((v)) is truncated) 
2. Orange: 4700 - 5000 (This is most likely where we heading)  
3. Red: 4100 - 4400 (Only possible if Wave (( iii -0.46% )) is extended)

 Bitcoin -1.79%  has recently developed an interesting pattern of completing a  bullish  and  bearish  cycle on the sixth of every month in an alternating order. As we can see in the chart above, a fall is followed by a rise. This has happened twice before and is expected to happen again now on the  6th 0.00%  of June, 2018. This time  Bitcoin -1.79%  will finish a  bearish  cycle and I expected to begin the next  bullish  cycle at least till the end of  6th 0.00%  of July, 2018. 

This pattern of rise and fall is also supported by other patterns on the chart that signal a  bullish  reversal. The support line has also held firmly and if this pattern of alternating rise and fall ensues,  Bitcoin -1.79%  could very well make new highs by the end of the year. The  RSI  is recovering from oversold levels and has now approached a normal.  Bitcoin -1.79%  is currently at a favorable point for  bullish  entries. The price broke a long term resistance as it break past the downtrend line in April, 2018. This was a big accomplishment for the bulls but the lack of confidence pulled the price back to the support line. Currently, the price is just above the support line and appears to be all set for a  bullish  comeback but the reality is, there are not enough bulls in the market. 

The past few months have been devastating for the price of  Bitcoin -1.79%  ( BTC -1.79% ) and a lot of investors are still running scared. Institutional investors are looking for more clarity regarding regulations concerning cryptocurrencies and also safer ways to invest and store their coins. As for retail investors, most of them comprise of first time investors who have never traded any financial asset before. So, when they saw that  Bitcoin -1.79%  ( BTC -1.79% ) is making 20% gains every day, they thought this could go on forever and jumped with both feet, only to find the carpet pulled under from their feet. Big investors have always played small investors as cannon fodder and have gotten away with their schemes even in regulated markets like forex or the stock market. Cryptocurrencies is a new market with no proper regulations which means it is natural to expect that those who can afford to not play by the rules, most likely won’t.

Hello friends,  

It's been a while since my last post; lack of time and an urge to do more research has mainly driven me to take a break from posting ideas on TradingView. I am still in the process of doing more research and study, but I figure posting once in a while couldn't hurt. 

Since I have become recently very convinced about this, I am outlining a very possible situation with  Bitcoin -1.79%  where the  trend line  we have been on since early October breaks, reaching around a temporary low of $5000. This is examined on the  daily chart , since this is one of the best charts to examine trends of this size. I have to first and foremost say that I am not trying to spread fear, I know many people do not like to hear  bearish  ideas, but  technical analysis  is ultimately a rational exercise, and I feel that possibilities with very strong signs should be explored. 

There are a few things to look at, but I first want to talk about the big picture with, long-term  support and resistance  lines. I think most people can agree that there was a very significant downtrending resistance line that began from the peak of the  ATH 0.63%  in late December, to the low of around $6400 (thick red line). After the break from that line, it seems we moved into a sideways trend, bouncing back and forth between an emerging downtrending resistance line (light red) and a support line that we seem to have been respecting since mid-October (light green); at least this appears to be the case with the lows, where the angle's effectiveness appears very strongly. Finally, based on previous bounces, we can establish a support of around $5000-$5300 (I've thus created a small  support zone  around that range, in dark green), as well as lower supports around $3200 and $2000 (though I do not believe these will be reached, in dark green).   

Now, onto the analysis - it's no secret that  Bitcoin -1.79%  has been squeezing in, ready for a significant move either upwards or downwards. Initially I considered the upwards move to be more likely due to the significant media attention cryptocurrency has been receiving, but after viewing previous market cycles of  Bitcoin -1.79%  (check 2013), it seems clear to me that the  bearish  scenario of closing in on the market cycle is very likely, and should at the very least be prepared for with proper risk management. According to Dow Theory, which is said to have laid the foundations of modern  technical analysis , history repeats itself, and this is a situation where we forced to consider this. 

Should we break from the line, we will likely fall straight down to the $5000-$5000 area, where we will shoot back up and bounce towards around $6700 or so (maybe a little less). From there one, we will likely enter a sideways trend, which we will continue until we see higher highs and higher lows and parabolic movement returns, which could lead to us challenging the all-time high, and hitting $35k-$50k. 

NOTE: I seem to have reached the max character limit for this section of the idea, so I will continue my text below.

Comment:
					Onto the short-term: 


Scenario A: 

The reason why I have drawn this movement into a pennant is this way, is simply because we have been moving through this ascending triangle for quite a while now (May 23rd to today). I don't think that the pattern will be sufficient to directly lead into a strong sell-off, but we should consider that the size of ascending triangle suggests a small movement downwards at the very least, which can create a higher low, and thus move into position into a bearish pennant. Why would a bearish pennant occur here and not have a bounce to $8500-$8700? The reason is in positioning - the huge downtrend (May 5th to May 26th) creates a very nice flagpole in which it hits around the $5000 area very perfectly, and thus I would not be surprised if this happens. 

Second reason: on the Stoch RSI indicator on the daily chart, it appears to be dangerously high, which would suggest it being oversold. For the most part, it seems to have called lows and highs, at least to some extent. This overdrawn movement may very well have increased the likelyhood of Bitcoin being oversold. This could suggest that this is the last step into a sharp downturn, but this does not preclude Situation B. Volume has also been steadily decreasing, but this is the case with any sort of consolidation, I believe. 

Finally, the lines I have drawn below the triangle are simply bounces that I think seem fairly reasonable. The length from to support to the lines correlate with the length of the flagpole, of course, though it may seem chopped off due to the huge line from the long-term support downwards. 


Scenario B: 

This is much simpler, Bitcoin hits the upper resistance line, bounces off, challenges the lower support line, and we potentially see a break, and the rest unfolds from there. 


----------------------------------------------------------------------- 


With all this being said, do not fear if you are hoping for more parabolic movement - this likely will not be the end, and will simply be the set up for a long, drawn out sideways movement until the first signs of bullish activity begin and we start all over again. If you are longing around here, please consider using risk management, prepare for every possibility. If you are shorting, the same applies. 

Please trade with care. I wish the best to all traders!

Comment:
					This really is a very minor note, but I just want to emphasize that the rising wedge (which I erroneously refer to as an ascending triangle, a bad habit I have) entering a bearish pennant is more based on intuition than anything. Also, this pennant is mainly based on the conservative assumption that the break will happen at 7900, if it happens at 7700 where we seem to be general resistance, the pennant would look something like this:

I am Mid term-bullish on  BTC -1.79%  going into the end of this week, but looking to get into the market on a pull back to occur before I get in to the market.  The jury is still out as to whether this weekly bear trend is ready to turn around.  

We can see that both the  RSI  and  MFI  are both  Bullish  on the daily having bottomed when reaching oversold on both at c. $7k support where we found our longer term  trend line . 

We are currently in the process of meeting the Tenkan (blue line) as I write this, so in the very short term, I am looking for a pull back to $7550 range for an entry.  One of the main reasons for this is that on the 4hour timeframes we are close to completing an edge to edge trade so the risk reward doesn’t fit my profile, however a break out from the cloud or above the Tenkan around $7777 will make me enter the market. 

The  RSI  and  MFI  have both been excellent indicators in this bear market.  Whenever  RSI  has gone above the 60 and the  MFI  80; its time to exit the market from a  bullish  trade and consider shorting as it progresses higher.   

Based on the  RSI ,  MFI  trends and the fact that we will run into the Kijun at just around $8-8.2k, I will be scalling out at this  bearish  confluence level to start looking for pull backs and reassessment as i believe it to be a key point as  

Best case scenario this trade would yield a 10% return before leverage. 
This is for illustrative purposes only, please DYOR and goodluck with your trading.

So the pullback trade that we were looking at worked out & has made it's way back to the neckline level of structure. We are now at what i like to call a ""decision point"" Essentially IF price is able to violate this current level od structure THEN we're likely to continue to our next price projection.  

Something that a lot of newer traders don't understand is that when it comes to bigger moves, the market will often provide multiple opportunities to get involved. For those who don't rush and for those who don't get discouraged. If you perform consistent analysis you can often find multiple ways to involve yourself in a trade even if you missed the first strike.

This is the way markets move, If you question my charting check my previous posts. Its as simple as pie. We are going down, How long and how far is too soon to say. Here is a chart that we can understand the future price action and where to buy back. Before you guys start blasting my comment section with the time and how it may not be right thats correct. I am not calculating the time I'm just making a technical drawing of the directions that we will see in the next few months.  

Recent price action has clear signs of wash trading / market manipulation fud and lots of nonsense. Its hard to prove almost impossible so as a trader we just need to deal with it. Ideally the situation you are supposed to trade are critical break up and break down points to enter the trade. Dont enter or exit dumb trades and lose money. As an experienced trader you should be looking for shorts, I would not consider a long unless we are over $10-12k

I am never good with words so instead of writing paragraphs of clarification to justify my call for SHORT since my last posting, I have explained everything on my chart with the least words possible using Fibonacci. It does not matter how popular  Bitcoin -1.79%  has become, or how deep it has disrupted the financial sector, or how many institutional investors have come to invest in it -- the psychology behind a market cycle does not change. 

I don't really encourage anyone to short  Bitcoin -1.79% , but in all honesty, don't expect the bulls to fly anytime soon. Like I said before, this correction that we are having right now is the ""MOTHER OF ALL CORRECTIONS"" after a 4-year-long bull cycle since the 2013 correction... and we are just halfway through.

My best idea ever, taking some time off the last 2 days :) The whales just continue to play their little games by squeezing leveraged short and long positions out of the market. Can't play them, it's just too easy. Maybe it's time we retail traders stand together, combine our  volume  and use their own game against them. Yeah, maybe we could even make a blockbuster movie about this :) I love me some science fiction :) LOL  

My last update of the previous analysis i showed 2 important support levels where the price could bounce up from. The first support around 7350 did the trick and the price got pushed back to 7700. From that point on i told my members that i thought i was seeing distribution, but it was still very confusing to figure out what was going on. TA was showing  bullish  signs, that  bull flag  was very strong and was even turning slowly up and was about to squeeze upwards. But of course out of no where the price got dumped, the move we saw a few hours ago. After that 200 point drop the price got pushed up again to 7700 like that dump was a glitch. If your a whale, why not push out leveraged traders and take your money while your accumulating or distributing. It's like a bonus, like the cherry on top :)  

Anyway, in this chart we can see allot of similarities of what is going on. As you know i have been saying i am still  bearish  for the medium term, but i just could not say what was going to happen on the short term. 2 days ago after we finally dropped out of that  wedge , i said we would have 2 options.  
- Break those 2 support levels from the last update of my previous chart (73xx and 71xx) 
- Make a higher low at those same support levels and make another move up above the high.  
 
As we can see in the chart, the  fractal  is not 100% identical so it's no guarantee that the 7700 high we just saw is the high already and that we start to move down. But based on this  fractal , i don't want to see the price get above the 7800/7900. This  fractal  confirms my  bearish  view as well. That's why TA is so great, you can turn any chart to fit your view :). 

Even without this  fractal , i just give it a very small chance that 7K price action is the fundament of a low to start another bull rally, i just highly doubt that. I want to see more  volume  to begin with and at least  double bottom  kind of formation. So the minimum i expect is a test of the 7100/6900in the coming week or 2. But the movement i have in mind for the med term is a drop below the 7K to form a big V shape low. If we get to see that, than i might even become  bullish  for the rest of the year :).  

As long as the price stays above the 73xx, we have to assume the bulls are still in control and we should see another wave up. So for me the 73xx is an important turning point.

					At the moment it looks like bulls are trying to push higher, this bull flag/triangle is still very strong. So no sign of weakness yet! First small sign would be a drop below 7620/7600. Bulls need to break 7700

					This is my bigger picture, think this bearish triangle is still 100% in play. I think if bulls can't break the 7800/7900 the bearish version is probably going to happen. Can't say HOW it will go, this blue line is just a guess. But a big V shape low would be the most bullish for the long term. I still think we are seeing distribution here. The only way this idea can be countered, is through a big increase of buying volume, if that doesn't happen, i think it's only a matter of time.

					What a surprise, nothing has changed :) 

The price took a small dump but the volume was low so no real read on what the intent was. So we might see another move up, if we start to see a small pump that takes out the 7800, be aware of a fake breakout. The blue line is a possibility of what the move could look like IF we move up and if the breakout fails. If that happens than we will probably get confirmation if the price breaks the 7600ish. If we break the 7800 it should stay above the 7700 to confirm another move up. Not much more to say about what's going on.

Comment:
					So we have made a small drop, but there is no volume confirming it, not yet at least. First small support has been broken, but not yet very meaningful because of the low volume. For the ones who shorted it, just be aware of another squeeze up, since this small move downwards looks a bit to controlled.  

Pure TA, it broke the channel and retested the former support as resistance now.

847,1528359434.0,Taiwan_Bear,2618 (Double top & 0.618 pull-back) - do not miss it!!,"
In the last couple of TAs I have mentioned the “2618 pattern” and have been asked what 2618 means. Sorry for taking it so long as it took me quite a while to put everything altogether. But, as promised, I have explained below the rules and trade setups for the 2618 pattern.  

What are the rules/setups/steps for 2618?  
1.	Form a  double top  (Note #1)  
2.	Neckline has to be broken  
3.	After price found support at point (b), wait for pull back to 0.618 fib retracement of (a)(b)  
4.	After price retraced to 0.618, look for confluence and sell (eg. Structures,  trendlines  ,  double top  on a lower time frame,  rsi  divergence,  bearish pin bar  ,  inside bar  break down etc.) (Note #2)  
5.	Stop loss to be set above  double top 
6.	Set Take Profit levels (Note #3)  

Note #1 ( Double top ):  
The first step for the formation of 2618 is to form a  double top  at key resistance levels. Why at key resistance levels? Because we want to avoid fake double tops which can occur occasionally.  

There are some variations between various resources (books, websites) regarding the definitions of “double top”. The main differences occur where:  
a)	Some said for a  double top  to be valid, the wick of the 2nd top cannot exceed the wick of the 1st top; whereas, others said:  
b)	The wick of the 2nd top can exceed the wick of the 1st top but the candle close of the 2nd top CANNOT exceed the wick of the 1st top; or  
c)	The wick of the 2nd top can exceed the wick of the 1st top and the candle close of the 2nd top CAN exceed the wick of the 1st top; or  
d)	The wick of the 2nd top meets at least the candle close of the 1st top; or  
e)	The body of the 2nd top cannot exceed the body of the 1st top  

Personally, I would say all the above definitions work just fine although I do prefer definition a) because it means that the selling pressure is strong and the bulls fail to make a higher high. When there is a higher high formed in a downtrend, it can mean the downtrend has reversed and therefore you might not want to sell when the price pulls back to the 0.618 fib retracement.  

Note #2 ( 0.618 retracement ):  
When the price pulls back to 0.618, it does not mean to sell straight away. There must be more than one reason to sell other than the 0.618 retrace. The more reasons the better. In this example, you can see there are certainly structures (key resistance levels) at the 0.618 retrace. As well, there was a  double top  formed on the lower time frame. Consequently, you can sell.  

After  BTC              hit the 0.618 retrace the first time, the price dropped from $9735 to $8650. but quickly bounced back to the 0.618 retrace level. That was a second & better opportunity to sell. Not only did  BTC              form a  double top  on the larger time frame, but also with a  bearish  divergence on the 4hr time frame. Accordingly, you have more reasons to sell.  

Note #3 (Set take profit)  
Same as the rules of “Double top”, there are some variations as to which price level should you take profits. Personally, I would stick to the below:  
1)	First, take profit when risk/reward ratio hits 1:1 (recommend to take 30% - 50% profits and adjust the SL of the remaining positions to break-even)  
2)	When price hits the same price level as the low after the neckline is broken ((b) point in this example)  
3)	When price hits 1.272 fib extension of (a)(b)  
4)	When price hits point (d) (using  AB=CD  pattern. If you are not sure what the rules of  AB=CD  are, you can refer to my previous TA in which I have attached the link below)  
5)	If in a one-way market (heavily bearish/bullish), you can always keep 10% to 20% of your positions and take profits when risk/reward ratio hits 1:5 or even 1:10

 BTC -1.79%  is on the verge of breaking to a daily higher high on the bounce if the bulls can see a push this morning. 
If we reject from here the daily will form a lower high and we will see a tightening pattern within the highlighted  support and resistance  lines.  
Important for the bulls to show up or we could stay in this range into tomorrow.  
Healthy consolidation after the most recent bull move and the 15 min chart needs to change the trend.  
Also look to  EMA  12 support on the 4 hour and hourly.  
Another morning like yesterday with the bulls comfortable as worst case, we likely stay in the tightening pattern if bulls cannot prove themselves.

The current situation of  Bitcoin -1.79%  is quite difficult. We are on a clear treshold. A lot of traders are saying that we are on a clear downtrend, but the same amount of people are claiming that we will have our reversal soon. 

This article tries to sum up all important information you have to need! 

1: Retracement of a parabolic uptrend: 
There is a rule of thumb for the retracement of a parabolic uptrend. We should retrace to approx. the 0.786  Fibonacci Retracement  +/- 10%! 
Depending where we start the count, we are already in that target. Although both ways (blue and red) have still some space for a further downwave! 







2: The bloody support of Bitcoin: 
The average cost of mining one  bitcoin -1.79%  are at USA/Russia approx. 4700$ and at 3100$ for china! 
A drop below a target of 4700$ would be savage. Nevertheless, i can't image that we will hit that target. 







3: Manipulation of  Bitcoin -1.79%  and the Bart Simpson Pattern: 
A friend of mine found some unusual patterns in the orderbooks of several exchanges: 
https://twitter.com/CryptoSyndrome 
Altcoins are manipulated on a daily basis. It seems that  bitcoin -1.79%  is now affected to this too, which causes all these 3-5% pump and dumps. 
Thus, we are forming all the time the Bartin Simpsons Patterns. 

4: Similarity to 2014: 
Bitcoin -1.79%  now: 






Bitcoin -1.79%  2014: 







5: Deminishing downtrend and a strong support 
If we see the falling  wedges  as the force of the downtrend, then the force is diminishing! 
Furthermore we have strong support which is holding now for the 4th time! 







6: The Indicators 
Having a look at the indicators at 2D, we have a good potential for an upwave now. 
The  volume  is deminishing which should indicate a breakout soon. 
The  MACD  is about to cross, the  RSI  was slightly overbought and is heading up like the  Stoch .  RSI . 
The 200  EMA  is slighty under the current price and act as a support. 

7: The symetrical Triangle 
The theory says, that we should have in a  sym -0.80% . triangle 5 times an  ABC  wave. The waves are not perfect, but we can construct them. 






As you can see, the last four ABC-Waves formed always a 1:1 extention, which indicates that we have finished wave 5. 

8: A possible Head and Shoulders 
Even if this is not the most perfect  Head and Shoulders  Pattern, it's still valid! 
We are currently at the neckline, which is a strong and important resistance. Breaking upwards should indicate a good uptrend. 







9: The magic  6th 0.00%  of the month 






Suprisingly we have on every  6th 0.00%  of the month a reversal. Why is that??? 
One reason could be the  CME Group Futures  with dates for the settlements always nearby the  6th 0.00%  of the month! 
http://www.cmegroup.com 

10: Longterm  Bullish  TA 
The whole pattern could be seen as a big  bullish pennant . 







11: Shortterm  Bullish  TA 
Leading diagonal  starting wave1 of an  Elliott Wave , since we have now an impulse wave, after the 5x  ABC  pattern inside the triangle is finished. 
Our target should be at the top of the triangle nearby 8600-8800$. 







12: Longterm  Bearish  TA 
We also can argue, that we are currenty in an downtrend and the  sym -0.80% . triangle just continuing the trend. 
Our target should be nearby 6000$ which is also a finished downwards  Elliott Wave .

Nothing is happening in the market:  volatility  has become extinct and coins' trading fallen out of fashion. Range-bound bots and robotic humans absolutely prosper in this environment. The price was unable to break the 7700 threshold. For me this is a  bearish  signal. Indicators provide mixed signals, so let's examine wave structure. The move from May 29 is a  3-wave -0.12%  correction within a larger downtrend. A price drop below 7500 would confirm this scenario.

					Impulse Wave Truncation (Truncated Fifth) - 
Truncated 5th wave is when the market has become so over-extended in Wave 3 that there is not much force left for the impulse wave to come to a proper completion. So when this happens, there is a chance that the last wave of the impulse, Wave 5, will not reach the end of Wave 3 before the market starts correcting in the opposite direction. At this point, the market is just too exhausted. This condition is often called a “failure” or a “Truncation.”

I can see many people still believe that we are going inside a  descending triangle . I also believed this in my idea that i shard on may 1st: 



 

Things can change so quickly and if we didn't adapt to the changes then someone will. That's why i believe that we have to be in fast adapt mode in this market. Doesn't mean that you need to change without checking yourself. I try to find 2-3 confirmations before i change my idea on something. This includes pattern changes, trend changes etc 

There are 21 corrective wave patterns in EW which is categorized into major 3 corrective wave patterns: 

Zigzag  (5-3-5) 
Flat (3-3-5) 
Triangle (3-3-3-3-3) 

And other patterns are combinations of the above which is:  

Double three (A combination of two corrective patterns above) 
Triple three (A combination of three corrective patterns above) 

So what i can see now is that we are in two double three combination corrective wave pattern: 








More info here:  

https://elliottwave-forecast.com/elliott-wave-theory/#corrective-waves 

Confirmations: 

1. Wave ((i)) of C is 1.6k and ((v)) is going to be completed below the triangle 
2. Wave (E) of the triangle can't go beyond the triangle.  
3. This has happened twice before in 2013 & 2015 

Each wave  got 3 subwaves (a,b &c) inside and we are in the subwave c of ((y)) of Y which is an impulsive wave. 

Impulsive waves: 1,3,5,a,c 
Corrective waves: 2,4,b 

Normal Fibo Ratios for these waves are: 

wave 2 = 0.5 - 0.8 of wave 1  
wave 3 = 1.236 - 1.618 of wave 1  
wave 4 = 0.5 - 0.618 of wave 3  
wave 5 = 0.618 - 1 of wave 1  
wave B = 0.5 - 0.8 of wave A  
wave C = 0.618 - 1.236 of wave A  

Now if you check what happened in subwave a of ((y)) of Y you can see that: 

Wave (i) of a: 985$ 
Wave (ii) of a: 434$  
Wave ( iii             ) of a: 1207$  
Wave (iv) of a: 691$ [~0.618 of Wave ( iii             )] 
Wave (v) of a: 950$  








I have seen  BTC              impulsive waves fibo ratios almost the same as the previous impulsive wave fibo ratios. 
Now if you apply the same for the last wave C of (E) this is what you get: 

Wave ((i)) of c: 1587$ 
Wave ((ii)) of c  = 793$ 
Wave (( iii             )) of c  = 1961$ 
Wave ((iv)) of c [~0.618 of Wave (( iii             ))] = 1212$ 
Wave ((v)) of c  = 1587$ 








Also note that Wave ((iv)) might not retrace upto 0.618 of Wave (( iii             )) as everyone will be in panic mode by that time so minimum retracement would be around 0.386 of Wave (( iii             )) which is around 756$ and this is why i can see it goes down to 5k level or little bit more towards 4.7k which is the lowest level of the  support zone  (orange dotted lines) 








So 3 Possible Support lines for reversal would be 

1. Blue: 5800 - 6100 (Only possible if Wave ((v)) is truncated) 
2. Orange: 4700 - 5000 (This is most likely where we heading)  
3. Red: 4100 - 4400 (Only possible if Wave (( iii             )) is extended)

 Bitcoin -1.79%  has recently developed an interesting pattern of completing a  bullish  and  bearish  cycle on the sixth of every month in an alternating order. As we can see in the chart above, a fall is followed by a rise. This has happened twice before and is expected to happen again now on the  6th 0.00%  of June, 2018. This time  Bitcoin -1.79%  will finish a  bearish  cycle and I expected to begin the next  bullish  cycle at least till the end of  6th 0.00%  of July, 2018. 

This pattern of rise and fall is also supported by other patterns on the chart that signal a  bullish  reversal. The support line has also held firmly and if this pattern of alternating rise and fall ensues,  Bitcoin -1.79%  could very well make new highs by the end of the year. The  RSI  is recovering from oversold levels and has now approached a normal.  Bitcoin -1.79%  is currently at a favorable point for  bullish  entries. The price broke a long term resistance as it break past the downtrend line in April, 2018. This was a big accomplishment for the bulls but the lack of confidence pulled the price back to the support line. Currently, the price is just above the support line and appears to be all set for a  bullish  comeback but the reality is, there are not enough bulls in the market. 

The past few months have been devastating for the price of  Bitcoin -1.79%  ( BTC -1.79% ) and a lot of investors are still running scared. Institutional investors are looking for more clarity regarding regulations concerning cryptocurrencies and also safer ways to invest and store their coins. As for retail investors, most of them comprise of first time investors who have never traded any financial asset before. So, when they saw that  Bitcoin -1.79%  ( BTC -1.79% ) is making 20% gains every day, they thought this could go on forever and jumped with both feet, only to find the carpet pulled under from their feet. Big investors have always played small investors as cannon fodder and have gotten away with their schemes even in regulated markets like forex or the stock market. Cryptocurrencies is a new market with no proper regulations which means it is natural to expect that those who can afford to not play by the rules, most likely won’t.

Hello friends,  

It's been a while since my last post; lack of time and an urge to do more research has mainly driven me to take a break from posting ideas on TradingView. I am still in the process of doing more research and study, but I figure posting once in a while couldn't hurt. 

Since I have become recently very convinced about this, I am outlining a very possible situation with  Bitcoin -1.79%  where the  trend line  we have been on since early October breaks, reaching around a temporary low of $5000. This is examined on the  daily chart , since this is one of the best charts to examine trends of this size. I have to first and foremost say that I am not trying to spread fear, I know many people do not like to hear  bearish  ideas, but  technical analysis  is ultimately a rational exercise, and I feel that possibilities with very strong signs should be explored. 

There are a few things to look at, but I first want to talk about the big picture with, long-term  support and resistance  lines. I think most people can agree that there was a very significant downtrending resistance line that began from the peak of the  ATH 0.63%  in late December, to the low of around $6400 (thick red line). After the break from that line, it seems we moved into a sideways trend, bouncing back and forth between an emerging downtrending resistance line (light red) and a support line that we seem to have been respecting since mid-October (light green); at least this appears to be the case with the lows, where the angle's effectiveness appears very strongly. Finally, based on previous bounces, we can establish a support of around $5000-$5300 (I've thus created a small  support zone  around that range, in dark green), as well as lower supports around $3200 and $2000 (though I do not believe these will be reached, in dark green).   

Now, onto the analysis - it's no secret that  Bitcoin -1.79%  has been squeezing in, ready for a significant move either upwards or downwards. Initially I considered the upwards move to be more likely due to the significant media attention cryptocurrency has been receiving, but after viewing previous market cycles of  Bitcoin -1.79%  (check 2013), it seems clear to me that the  bearish  scenario of closing in on the market cycle is very likely, and should at the very least be prepared for with proper risk management. According to Dow Theory, which is said to have laid the foundations of modern  technical analysis , history repeats itself, and this is a situation where we forced to consider this. 

Should we break from the line, we will likely fall straight down to the $5000-$5000 area, where we will shoot back up and bounce towards around $6700 or so (maybe a little less). From there one, we will likely enter a sideways trend, which we will continue until we see higher highs and higher lows and parabolic movement returns, which could lead to us challenging the all-time high, and hitting $35k-$50k. 

NOTE: I seem to have reached the max character limit for this section of the idea, so I will continue my text below.

Comment:
					Onto the short-term: 


Scenario A: 

The reason why I have drawn this movement into a pennant is this way, is simply because we have been moving through this ascending triangle for quite a while now (May 23rd to today). I don't think that the pattern will be sufficient to directly lead into a strong sell-off, but we should consider that the size of ascending triangle suggests a small movement downwards at the very least, which can create a higher low, and thus move into position into a bearish pennant. Why would a bearish pennant occur here and not have a bounce to $8500-$8700? The reason is in positioning - the huge downtrend (May 5th to May 26th) creates a very nice flagpole in which it hits around the $5000 area very perfectly, and thus I would not be surprised if this happens. 

Second reason: on the Stoch RSI indicator on the daily chart, it appears to be dangerously high, which would suggest it being oversold. For the most part, it seems to have called lows and highs, at least to some extent. This overdrawn movement may very well have increased the likelyhood of Bitcoin being oversold. This could suggest that this is the last step into a sharp downturn, but this does not preclude Situation B. Volume has also been steadily decreasing, but this is the case with any sort of consolidation, I believe. 

Finally, the lines I have drawn below the triangle are simply bounces that I think seem fairly reasonable. The length from to support to the lines correlate with the length of the flagpole, of course, though it may seem chopped off due to the huge line from the long-term support downwards. 


Scenario B: 

This is much simpler, Bitcoin hits the upper resistance line, bounces off, challenges the lower support line, and we potentially see a break, and the rest unfolds from there. 


----------------------------------------------------------------------- 


With all this being said, do not fear if you are hoping for more parabolic movement - this likely will not be the end, and will simply be the set up for a long, drawn out sideways movement until the first signs of bullish activity begin and we start all over again. If you are longing around here, please consider using risk management, prepare for every possibility. If you are shorting, the same applies. 

Please trade with care. I wish the best to all traders!

Comment:
					This really is a very minor note, but I just want to emphasize that the rising wedge (which I erroneously refer to as an ascending triangle, a bad habit I have) entering a bearish pennant is more based on intuition than anything. Also, this pennant is mainly based on the conservative assumption that the break will happen at 7900, if it happens at 7700 where we seem to be general resistance, the pennant would look something like this:

Jun 7




I am Mid term-bullish on  BTC -1.79%  going into the end of this week, but looking to get into the market on a pull back to occur before I get in to the market.  The jury is still out as to whether this weekly bear trend is ready to turn around.  

We can see that both the  RSI  and  MFI  are both  Bullish  on the daily having bottomed when reaching oversold on both at c. $7k support where we found our longer term  trend line . 

We are currently in the process of meeting the Tenkan (blue line) as I write this, so in the very short term, I am looking for a pull back to $7550 range for an entry.  One of the main reasons for this is that on the 4hour timeframes we are close to completing an edge to edge trade so the risk reward doesn’t fit my profile, however a break out from the cloud or above the Tenkan around $7777 will make me enter the market. 

The  RSI  and  MFI  have both been excellent indicators in this bear market.  Whenever  RSI  has gone above the 60 and the  MFI  80; its time to exit the market from a  bullish  trade and consider shorting as it progresses higher.   

Based on the  RSI ,  MFI  trends and the fact that we will run into the Kijun at just around $8-8.2k, I will be scalling out at this  bearish  confluence level to start looking for pull backs and reassessment as i believe it to be a key point as  

Best case scenario this trade would yield a 10% return before leverage. 
This is for illustrative purposes only, please DYOR and goodluck with your trading.

So the pullback trade that we were looking at worked out & has made it's way back to the neckline level of structure. We are now at what i like to call a ""decision point"" Essentially IF price is able to violate this current level od structure THEN we're likely to continue to our next price projection.  

Something that a lot of newer traders don't understand is that when it comes to bigger moves, the market will often provide multiple opportunities to get involved. For those who don't rush and for those who don't get discouraged. If you perform consistent analysis you can often find multiple ways to involve yourself in a trade even if you missed the first strike.

Here is a chart that we can understand the future price action and where to buy back. Before you guys start blasting my comment section with the time and how it may not be right thats correct. I am not calculating the time I'm just making a technical drawing of the directions that we will see in the next few months.  

Recent price action has clear signs of wash trading / market manipulation fud and lots of nonsense. Its hard to prove almost impossible so as a trader we just need to deal with it. Ideally the situation you are supposed to trade are critical break up and break down points to enter the trade. Dont enter or exit dumb trades and lose money. As an experienced trader you should be looking for shorts, I would not consider a long unless we are over $10-12k

I am never good with words so instead of writing paragraphs of clarification to justify my call for SHORT since my last posting, I have explained everything on my chart with the least words possible using Fibonacci. It does not matter how popular  Bitcoin -1.78%  has become, or how deep it has disrupted the financial sector, or how many institutional investors have come to invest in it -- the psychology behind a market cycle does not change. 

I don't really encourage anyone to short  Bitcoin -1.78% , but in all honesty, don't expect the bulls to fly anytime soon. Like I said before, this correction that we are having right now is the ""MOTHER OF ALL CORRECTIONS"" after a 4-year-long bull cycle since the 2013 correction... and we are just halfway through.

My best idea ever, taking some time off the last 2 days :) The whales just continue to play their little games by squeezing leveraged short and long positions out of the market. Can't play them, it's just too easy. Maybe it's time we retail traders stand together, combine our  volume  and use their own game against them. Yeah, maybe we could even make a blockbuster movie about this :) I love me some science fiction :) LOL  

My last update of the previous analysis i showed 2 important support levels where the price could bounce up from. The first support around 7350 did the trick and the price got pushed back to 7700. From that point on i told my members that i thought i was seeing distribution, but it was still very confusing to figure out what was going on. TA was showing  bullish  signs, that  bull flag  was very strong and was even turning slowly up and was about to squeeze upwards. But of course out of no where the price got dumped, the move we saw a few hours ago. After that 200 point drop the price got pushed up again to 7700 like that dump was a glitch. If your a whale, why not push out leveraged traders and take your money while your accumulating or distributing. It's like a bonus, like the cherry on top :)  

Anyway, in this chart we can see allot of similarities of what is going on. As you know i have been saying i am still  bearish  for the medium term, but i just could not say what was going to happen on the short term. 2 days ago after we finally dropped out of that  wedge , i said we would have 2 options.  
- Break those 2 support levels from the last update of my previous chart (73xx and 71xx) 
- Make a higher low at those same support levels and make another move up above the high.  
 
As we can see in the chart, the  fractal  is not 100% identical so it's no guarantee that the 7700 high we just saw is the high already and that we start to move down. But based on this  fractal , i don't want to see the price get above the 7800/7900. This  fractal  confirms my  bearish  view as well. That's why TA is so great, you can turn any chart to fit your view :). 

Even without this  fractal , i just give it a very small chance that 7K price action is the fundament of a low to start another bull rally, i just highly doubt that. I want to see more  volume  to begin with and at least  double bottom  kind of formation. So the minimum i expect is a test of the 7100/6900in the coming week or 2. But the movement i have in mind for the med term is a drop below the 7K to form a big V shape low. If we get to see that, than i might even become  bullish  for the rest of the year :).  

As long as the price stays above the 73xx, we have to assume the bulls are still in control and we should see another wave up. So for me the 73xx is an important turning point.

					At the moment it looks like bulls are trying to push higher, this bull flag/triangle is still very strong. So no sign of weakness yet! First small sign would be a drop below 7620/7600. Bulls need to break 7700

					This is my bigger picture, think this bearish triangle is still 100% in play. I think if bulls can't break the 7800/7900 the bearish version is probably going to happen. Can't say HOW it will go, this blue line is just a guess. But a big V shape low would be the most bullish for the long term. I still think we are seeing distribution here. The only way this idea can be countered, is through a big increase of buying volume, if that doesn't happen, i think it's only a matter of time.

					Lower time frame we can see a new upwards channel and maybe even a rising wedge. From the looks of it, it's slowly going down to test the support line again. Depending on what will happen there we can make a better prediction for the rest of the day.

					What a surprise, nothing has changed :) 

The price took a small dump but the volume was low so no real read on what the intent was. So we might see another move up, if we start to see a small pump that takes out the 7800, be aware of a fake breakout. The blue line is a possibility of what the move could look like IF we move up and if the breakout fails. If that happens than we will probably get confirmation if the price breaks the 7600ish. If we break the 7800 it should stay above the 7700 to confirm another move up. Not much more to say about what's going on.

					So we have made a small drop, but there is no volume confirming it, not yet at least. First small support has been broken, but not yet very meaningful because of the low volume. For the ones who shorted it, just be aware of another squeeze up, since this small move downwards looks a bit to controlled.  

Pure TA, it broke the channel and retested the former support as resistance now.

In the last couple of TAs I have mentioned the “2618 pattern” and have been asked what 2618 means. Sorry for taking it so long as it took me quite a while to put everything altogether. But, as promised, I have explained below the rules and trade setups for the 2618 pattern.  

What are the rules/setups/steps for 2618?  
1.	Form a  double top  (Note #1)  
2.	Neckline has to be broken  
3.	After price found support at point (b), wait for pull back to 0.618 fib retracement of (a)(b)  
4.	After price retraced to 0.618, look for confluence and sell (eg. Structures,  trendlines  ,  double top  on a lower time frame,  rsi  divergence,  bearish pin bar  ,  inside bar  break down etc.) (Note #2)  
5.	Stop loss to be set above  double top 
6.	Set Take Profit levels (Note #3)  

Note #1 ( Double top ):  
The first step for the formation of 2618 is to form a  double top  at key resistance levels. Why at key resistance levels? Because we want to avoid fake double tops which can occur occasionally.  

There are some variations between various resources (books, websites) regarding the definitions of “double top”. The main differences occur where:  
a)	Some said for a  double top  to be valid, the wick of the 2nd top cannot exceed the wick of the 1st top; whereas, others said:  
b)	The wick of the 2nd top can exceed the wick of the 1st top but the candle close of the 2nd top CANNOT exceed the wick of the 1st top; or  
c)	The wick of the 2nd top can exceed the wick of the 1st top and the candle close of the 2nd top CAN exceed the wick of the 1st top; or  
d)	The wick of the 2nd top meets at least the candle close of the 1st top; or  
e)	The body of the 2nd top cannot exceed the body of the 1st top  

Personally, I would say all the above definitions work just fine although I do prefer definition a) because it means that the selling pressure is strong and the bulls fail to make a higher high. When there is a higher high formed in a downtrend, it can mean the downtrend has reversed and therefore you might not want to sell when the price pulls back to the 0.618 fib retracement.  

Note #2 ( 0.618 retracement ):  
When the price pulls back to 0.618, it does not mean to sell straight away. There must be more than one reason to sell other than the 0.618 retrace. The more reasons the better. In this example, you can see there are certainly structures (key resistance levels) at the 0.618 retrace. As well, there was a  double top  formed on the lower time frame. Consequently, you can sell.  

After  BTC -1.70%  hit the 0.618 retrace the first time, the price dropped from $9735 to $8650. but quickly bounced back to the 0.618 retrace level. That was a second & better opportunity to sell. Not only did  BTC -1.70%  form a  double top  on the larger time frame, but also with a  bearish  divergence on the 4hr time frame. Accordingly, you have more reasons to sell.  

Note #3 (Set take profit)  
Same as the rules of “Double top”, there are some variations as to which price level should you take profits. Personally, I would stick to the below:  
1)	First, take profit when risk/reward ratio hits 1:1 (recommend to take 30% - 50% profits and adjust the SL of the remaining positions to break-even)  
2)	When price hits the same price level as the low after the neckline is broken ((b) point in this example)  
3)	When price hits 1.272 fib extension of (a)(b)  
4)	When price hits point (d) (using  AB=CD  pattern. If you are not sure what the rules of  AB=CD  are, you can refer to my previous TA in which I have attached the link below)  
5)	If in a one-way market (heavily bearish/bullish), you can always keep 10% to 20% of your positions and take profits when risk/reward ratio hits 1:5 or even 1:10

 BTC -1.70%  is on the verge of breaking to a daily higher high on the bounce if the bulls can see a push this morning. 
If we reject from here the daily will form a lower high and we will see a tightening pattern within the highlighted  support and resistance  lines.  
Important for the bulls to show up or we could stay in this range into tomorrow.  
Healthy consolidation after the most recent bull move and the 15 min chart needs to change the trend.  
Also look to  EMA  12 support on the 4 hour and hourly.  
Another morning like yesterday with the bulls comfortable as worst case, we likely stay in the tightening pattern if bulls cannot prove themselves.

The current situation of  Bitcoin -1.70%  is quite difficult. We are on a clear treshold. A lot of traders are saying that we are on a clear downtrend, but the same amount of people are claiming that we will have our reversal soon. 

This article tries to sum up all important information you have to need! 

1: Retracement of a parabolic uptrend: 
There is a rule of thumb for the retracement of a parabolic uptrend. We should retrace to approx. the 0.786  Fibonacci Retracement  +/- 10%! 
Depending where we start the count, we are already in that target. Although both ways (blue and red) have still some space for a further downwave! 







2: The bloody support of Bitcoin: 
The average cost of mining one  bitcoin -1.70%  are at USA/Russia approx. 4700$ and at 3100$ for china! 
A drop below a target of 4700$ would be savage. Nevertheless, i can't image that we will hit that target. 







3: Manipulation of  Bitcoin -1.70%  and the Bart Simpson Pattern: 
A friend of mine found some unusual patterns in the orderbooks of several exchanges: 
https://twitter.com/CryptoSyndrome 
Altcoins are manipulated on a daily basis. It seems that  bitcoin -1.70%  is now affected to this too, which causes all these 3-5% pump and dumps. 
Thus, we are forming all the time the Bartin Simpsons Patterns. 

4: Similarity to 2014: 
Bitcoin -1.70%  now: 






Bitcoin -1.70%  2014: 







5: Deminishing downtrend and a strong support 
If we see the falling  wedges  as the force of the downtrend, then the force is diminishing! 
Furthermore we have strong support which is holding now for the 4th time! 







6: The Indicators 
Having a look at the indicators at 2D, we have a good potential for an upwave now. 
The  volume  is deminishing which should indicate a breakout soon. 
The  MACD  is about to cross, the  RSI  was slightly overbought and is heading up like the  Stoch .  RSI . 
The 200  EMA  is slighty under the current price and act as a support. 

7: The symetrical Triangle 
The theory says, that we should have in a  sym -0.80% . triangle 5 times an  ABC  wave. The waves are not perfect, but we can construct them. 






As you can see, the last four ABC-Waves formed always a 1:1 extention, which indicates that we have finished wave 5. 

8: A possible Head and Shoulders 
Even if this is not the most perfect  Head and Shoulders  Pattern, it's still valid! 
We are currently at the neckline, which is a strong and important resistance. Breaking upwards should indicate a good uptrend. 







9: The magic  6th 0.00%  of the month 






Suprisingly we have on every  6th 0.00%  of the month a reversal. Why is that??? 
One reason could be the  CME Group Futures  with dates for the settlements always nearby the  6th 0.00%  of the month! 
http://www.cmegroup.com 

10: Longterm  Bullish  TA 
The whole pattern could be seen as a big  bullish pennant . 







11: Shortterm  Bullish  TA 
Leading diagonal  starting wave1 of an  Elliott Wave , since we have now an impulse wave, after the 5x  ABC  pattern inside the triangle is finished. 
Our target should be at the top of the triangle nearby 8600-8800$. 







12: Longterm  Bearish  TA 
We also can argue, that we are currenty in an downtrend and the  sym -0.80% . triangle just continuing the trend. 
Our target should be nearby 6000$ which is also a finished downwards  Elliott Wave .

Nothing is happening in the market:  volatility  has become extinct and coins' trading fallen out of fashion. Range-bound bots and robotic humans absolutely prosper in this environment. The price was unable to break the 7700 threshold. For me this is a  bearish  signal. Indicators provide mixed signals, so let's examine wave structure. The move from May 29 is a  3-wave -0.12%  correction within a larger downtrend. A price drop below 7500 would confirm this scenario.

					Impulse Wave Truncation (Truncated Fifth) - 
Truncated 5th wave is when the market has become so over-extended in Wave 3 that there is not much force left for the impulse wave to come to a proper completion. So when this happens, there is a chance that the last wave of the impulse, Wave 5, will not reach the end of Wave 3 before the market starts correcting in the opposite direction. At this point, the market is just too exhausted. This condition is often called a “failure” or a “Truncation.”

I can see many people still believe that we are going inside a  descending triangle . I also believed this in my idea that i shard on may 1st: 



 

Things can change so quickly and if we didn't adapt to the changes then someone will. That's why i believe that we have to be in fast adapt mode in this market. Doesn't mean that you need to change without checking yourself. I try to find 2-3 confirmations before i change my idea on something. This includes pattern changes, trend changes etc 

There are 21 corrective wave patterns in EW which is categorized into major 3 corrective wave patterns: 

Zigzag  (5-3-5) 
Flat (3-3-5) 
Triangle (3-3-3-3-3) 

And other patterns are combinations of the above which is:  

Double three (A combination of two corrective patterns above) 
Triple three (A combination of three corrective patterns above) 

So what i can see now is that we are in two double three combination corrective wave pattern: 








More info here:  

https://elliottwave-forecast.com/elliott-wave-theory/#corrective-waves 

Confirmations: 

1. Wave ((i)) of C is 1.6k and ((v)) is going to be completed below the triangle 
2. Wave (E) of the triangle can't go beyond the triangle.  
3. This has happened twice before in 2013 & 2015 

Each wave  got 3 subwaves (a,b &c) inside and we are in the subwave c of ((y)) of Y which is an impulsive wave. 

Impulsive waves: 1,3,5,a,c 
Corrective waves: 2,4,b 

Normal Fibo Ratios for these waves are: 

wave 2 = 0.5 - 0.8 of wave 1  
wave 3 = 1.236 - 1.618 of wave 1  
wave 4 = 0.5 - 0.618 of wave 3  
wave 5 = 0.618 - 1 of wave 1  
wave B = 0.5 - 0.8 of wave A  
wave C = 0.618 - 1.236 of wave A  

Now if you check what happened in subwave a of ((y)) of Y you can see that: 

Wave (i) of a: 985$ 
Wave (ii) of a: 434$  
Wave ( iii -0.41% ) of a: 1207$  
Wave (iv) of a: 691$ [~0.618 of Wave ( iii -0.41% )] 
Wave (v) of a: 950$  








I have seen  BTC -1.79%  impulsive waves fibo ratios almost the same as the previous impulsive wave fibo ratios. 
Now if you apply the same for the last wave C of (E) this is what you get: 

Wave ((i)) of c: 1587$ 
Wave ((ii)) of c  = 793$ 
Wave (( iii -0.41% )) of c  = 1961$ 
Wave ((iv)) of c [~0.618 of Wave (( iii -0.41% ))] = 1212$ 
Wave ((v)) of c  = 1587$ 








Also note that Wave ((iv)) might not retrace upto 0.618 of Wave (( iii -0.41% )) as everyone will be in panic mode by that time so minimum retracement would be around 0.386 of Wave (( iii -0.41% )) which is around 756$ and this is why i can see it goes down to 5k level or little bit more towards 4.7k which is the lowest level of the  support zone  (orange dotted lines) 








So 3 Possible Support lines for reversal would be 

1. Blue: 5800 - 6100 (Only possible if Wave ((v)) is truncated) 
2. Orange: 4700 - 5000 (This is most likely where we heading)  
3. Red: 4100 - 4400 (Only possible if Wave (( iii -0.41% )) is extended)

 Bitcoin -1.78%  has recently developed an interesting pattern of completing a  bullish  and  bearish  cycle on the sixth of every month in an alternating order. As we can see in the chart above, a fall is followed by a rise. This has happened twice before and is expected to happen again now on the  6th 0.00%  of June, 2018. This time  Bitcoin -1.78%  will finish a  bearish  cycle and I expected to begin the next  bullish  cycle at least till the end of  6th 0.00%  of July, 2018. 

This pattern of rise and fall is also supported by other patterns on the chart that signal a  bullish  reversal. The support line has also held firmly and if this pattern of alternating rise and fall ensues,  Bitcoin -1.78%  could very well make new highs by the end of the year. The  RSI  is recovering from oversold levels and has now approached a normal.  Bitcoin -1.78%  is currently at a favorable point for  bullish  entries. The price broke a long term resistance as it break past the downtrend line in April, 2018. This was a big accomplishment for the bulls but the lack of confidence pulled the price back to the support line. Currently, the price is just above the support line and appears to be all set for a  bullish  comeback but the reality is, there are not enough bulls in the market. 

The past few months have been devastating for the price of  Bitcoin -1.78%  ( BTC -1.78% ) and a lot of investors are still running scared. Institutional investors are looking for more clarity regarding regulations concerning cryptocurrencies and also safer ways to invest and store their coins. As for retail investors, most of them comprise of first time investors who have never traded any financial asset before. So, when they saw that  Bitcoin -1.78%  ( BTC -1.78% ) is making 20% gains every day, they thought this could go on forever and jumped with both feet, only to find the carpet pulled under from their feet. Big investors have always played small investors as cannon fodder and have gotten away with their schemes even in regulated markets like forex or the stock market. Cryptocurrencies is a new market with no proper regulations which means it is natural to expect that those who can afford to not play by the rules, most likely won’t.

Hello friends,  

It's been a while since my last post; lack of time and an urge to do more research has mainly driven me to take a break from posting ideas on TradingView. I am still in the process of doing more research and study, but I figure posting once in a while couldn't hurt. 

Since I have become recently very convinced about this, I am outlining a very possible situation with  Bitcoin -1.79%  where the  trend line  we have been on since early October breaks, reaching around a temporary low of $5000. This is examined on the  daily chart , since this is one of the best charts to examine trends of this size. I have to first and foremost say that I am not trying to spread fear, I know many people do not like to hear  bearish  ideas, but  technical analysis  is ultimately a rational exercise, and I feel that possibilities with very strong signs should be explored. 

There are a few things to look at, but I first want to talk about the big picture with, long-term  support and resistance  lines. I think most people can agree that there was a very significant downtrending resistance line that began from the peak of the  ATH 0.63%  in late December, to the low of around $6400 (thick red line). After the break from that line, it seems we moved into a sideways trend, bouncing back and forth between an emerging downtrending resistance line (light red) and a support line that we seem to have been respecting since mid-October (light green); at least this appears to be the case with the lows, where the angle's effectiveness appears very strongly. Finally, based on previous bounces, we can establish a support of around $5000-$5300 (I've thus created a small  support zone  around that range, in dark green), as well as lower supports around $3200 and $2000 (though I do not believe these will be reached, in dark green).   

Now, onto the analysis - it's no secret that  Bitcoin -1.79%  has been squeezing in, ready for a significant move either upwards or downwards. Initially I considered the upwards move to be more likely due to the significant media attention cryptocurrency has been receiving, but after viewing previous market cycles of  Bitcoin -1.79%  (check 2013), it seems clear to me that the  bearish  scenario of closing in on the market cycle is very likely, and should at the very least be prepared for with proper risk management. According to Dow Theory, which is said to have laid the foundations of modern  technical analysis , history repeats itself, and this is a situation where we forced to consider this. 

Should we break from the line, we will likely fall straight down to the $5000-$5000 area, where we will shoot back up and bounce towards around $6700 or so (maybe a little less). From there one, we will likely enter a sideways trend, which we will continue until we see higher highs and higher lows and parabolic movement returns, which could lead to us challenging the all-time high, and hitting $35k-$50k. 

NOTE: I seem to have reached the max character limit for this section of the idea, so I will continue my text below.

Comment:
					Onto the short-term: 


Scenario A: 

The reason why I have drawn this movement into a pennant is this way, is simply because we have been moving through this ascending triangle for quite a while now (May 23rd to today). I don't think that the pattern will be sufficient to directly lead into a strong sell-off, but we should consider that the size of ascending triangle suggests a small movement downwards at the very least, which can create a higher low, and thus move into position into a bearish pennant. Why would a bearish pennant occur here and not have a bounce to $8500-$8700? The reason is in positioning - the huge downtrend (May 5th to May 26th) creates a very nice flagpole in which it hits around the $5000 area very perfectly, and thus I would not be surprised if this happens. 

Second reason: on the Stoch RSI indicator on the daily chart, it appears to be dangerously high, which would suggest it being oversold. For the most part, it seems to have called lows and highs, at least to some extent. This overdrawn movement may very well have increased the likelyhood of Bitcoin being oversold. This could suggest that this is the last step into a sharp downturn, but this does not preclude Situation B. Volume has also been steadily decreasing, but this is the case with any sort of consolidation, I believe. 

Finally, the lines I have drawn below the triangle are simply bounces that I think seem fairly reasonable. The length from to support to the lines correlate with the length of the flagpole, of course, though it may seem chopped off due to the huge line from the long-term support downwards. 


Scenario B: 

This is much simpler, Bitcoin hits the upper resistance line, bounces off, challenges the lower support line, and we potentially see a break, and the rest unfolds from there. 


----------------------------------------------------------------------- 


With all this being said, do not fear if you are hoping for more parabolic movement - this likely will not be the end, and will simply be the set up for a long, drawn out sideways movement until the first signs of bullish activity begin and we start all over again. If you are longing around here, please consider using risk management, prepare for every possibility. If you are shorting, the same applies. 

Please trade with care. I wish the best to all traders!

Comment:
					This really is a very minor note, but I just want to emphasize that the rising wedge (which I erroneously refer to as an ascending triangle, a bad habit I have) entering a bearish pennant is more based on intuition than anything. Also, this pennant is mainly based on the conservative assumption that the break will happen at 7900, if it happens at 7700 where we seem to be general resistance, the pennant would look something like this:

Jun 7




I am Mid term-bullish on  BTC -1.79%  going into the end of this week, but looking to get into the market on a pull back to occur before I get in to the market.  The jury is still out as to whether this weekly bear trend is ready to turn around.  

We can see that both the  RSI  and  MFI  are both  Bullish  on the daily having bottomed when reaching oversold on both at c. $7k support where we found our longer term  trend line . 

We are currently in the process of meeting the Tenkan (blue line) as I write this, so in the very short term, I am looking for a pull back to $7550 range for an entry.  One of the main reasons for this is that on the 4hour timeframes we are close to completing an edge to edge trade so the risk reward doesn’t fit my profile, however a break out from the cloud or above the Tenkan around $7777 will make me enter the market. 

The  RSI  and  MFI  have both been excellent indicators in this bear market.  Whenever  RSI  has gone above the 60 and the  MFI  80; its time to exit the market from a  bullish  trade and consider shorting as it progresses higher.   

Based on the  RSI ,  MFI  trends and the fact that we will run into the Kijun at just around $8-8.2k, I will be scalling out at this  bearish  confluence level to start looking for pull backs and reassessment as i believe it to be a key point as  

Best case scenario this trade would yield a 10% return before leverage. 
This is for illustrative purposes only, please DYOR and goodluck with your trading.

So the pullback trade that we were looking at worked out & has made it's way back to the neckline level of structure. We are now at what i like to call a ""decision point"" Essentially IF price is able to violate this current level od structure THEN we're likely to continue to our next price projection.  

Something that a lot of newer traders don't understand is that when it comes to bigger moves, the market will often provide multiple opportunities to get involved. For those who don't rush and for those who don't get discouraged. If you perform consistent analysis you can often find multiple ways to involve yourself in a trade even if you missed the first strike.

Ideally the situation you are supposed to trade are critical break up and break down points to enter the trade. Dont enter or exit dumb trades and lose money. As an experienced trader you should be looking for shorts, I would not consider a long unless we are over $10-12k

I am never good with words so instead of writing paragraphs of clarification to justify my call for SHORT since my last posting, I have explained everything on my chart with the least words possible using Fibonacci. It does not matter how popular  Bitcoin -1.78%  has become, or how deep it has disrupted the financial sector, or how many institutional investors have come to invest in it -- the psychology behind a market cycle does not change. 

I don't really encourage anyone to short  Bitcoin -1.78% , but in all honesty, don't expect the bulls to fly anytime soon. Like I said before, this correction that we are having right now is the ""MOTHER OF ALL CORRECTIONS"" after a 4-year-long bull cycle since the 2013 correction... and we are just halfway through.

My best idea ever, taking some time off the last 2 days :) The whales just continue to play their little games by squeezing leveraged short and long positions out of the market. Can't play them, it's just too easy. Maybe it's time we retail traders stand together, combine our  volume  and use their own game against them. Yeah, maybe we could even make a blockbuster movie about this :) I love me some science fiction :) LOL  

My last update of the previous analysis i showed 2 important support levels where the price could bounce up from. The first support around 7350 did the trick and the price got pushed back to 7700. From that point on i told my members that i thought i was seeing distribution, but it was still very confusing to figure out what was going on. TA was showing  bullish  signs, that  bull flag  was very strong and was even turning slowly up and was about to squeeze upwards. But of course out of no where the price got dumped, the move we saw a few hours ago. After that 200 point drop the price got pushed up again to 7700 like that dump was a glitch. If your a whale, why not push out leveraged traders and take your money while your accumulating or distributing. It's like a bonus, like the cherry on top :)  

Anyway, in this chart we can see allot of similarities of what is going on. As you know i have been saying i am still  bearish  for the medium term, but i just could not say what was going to happen on the short term. 2 days ago after we finally dropped out of that  wedge , i said we would have 2 options.  
- Break those 2 support levels from the last update of my previous chart (73xx and 71xx) 
- Make a higher low at those same support levels and make another move up above the high.  
 
As we can see in the chart, the  fractal  is not 100% identical so it's no guarantee that the 7700 high we just saw is the high already and that we start to move down. But based on this  fractal , i don't want to see the price get above the 7800/7900. This  fractal  confirms my  bearish  view as well. That's why TA is so great, you can turn any chart to fit your view :). 

Even without this  fractal , i just give it a very small chance that 7K price action is the fundament of a low to start another bull rally, i just highly doubt that. I want to see more  volume  to begin with and at least  double bottom  kind of formation. So the minimum i expect is a test of the 7100/6900in the coming week or 2. But the movement i have in mind for the med term is a drop below the 7K to form a big V shape low. If we get to see that, than i might even become  bullish  for the rest of the year :).  

As long as the price stays above the 73xx, we have to assume the bulls are still in control and we should see another wave up. So for me the 73xx is an important turning point.

Comment:
					At the moment it looks like bulls are trying to push higher, this bull flag/triangle is still very strong. So no sign of weakness yet! First small sign would be a drop below 7620/7600. Bulls need to break 7700

Comment:
					This is my bigger picture, think this bearish triangle is still 100% in play. I think if bulls can't break the 7800/7900 the bearish version is probably going to happen. Can't say HOW it will go, this blue line is just a guess. But a big V shape low would be the most bullish for the long term. I still think we are seeing distribution here. The only way this idea can be countered, is through a big increase of buying volume, if that doesn't happen, i think it's only a matter of time.

					Lower time frame we can see a new upwards channel and maybe even a rising wedge. From the looks of it, it's slowly going down to test the support line again. Depending on what will happen there we can make a better prediction for the rest of the day.

Comment:
					What a surprise, nothing has changed :) 

The price took a small dump but the volume was low so no real read on what the intent was. So we might see another move up, if we start to see a small pump that takes out the 7800, be aware of a fake breakout. The blue line is a possibility of what the move could look like IF we move up and if the breakout fails. If that happens than we will probably get confirmation if the price breaks the 7600ish. If we break the 7800 it should stay above the 7700 to confirm another move up. Not much more to say about what's going on.

Comment:
					So we have made a small drop, but there is no volume confirming it, not yet at least. First small support has been broken, but not yet very meaningful because of the low volume. For the ones who shorted it, just be aware of another squeeze up, since this small move downwards looks a bit to controlled.  

Pure TA, it broke the channel and retested the former support as resistance now.

883,1528359434.0,Taiwan_Bear,2618 (Double top & 0.618 pull-back) - do not miss it!!,"
In the last couple of TAs I have mentioned the “2618 pattern” and have been asked what 2618 means. Sorry for taking it so long as it took me quite a while to put everything altogether. But, as promised, I have explained below the rules and trade setups for the 2618 pattern.  

What are the rules/setups/steps for 2618?  
1.	Form a  double top  (Note #1)  
2.	Neckline has to be broken  
3.	After price found support at point (b), wait for pull back to 0.618 fib retracement of (a)(b)  
4.	After price retraced to 0.618, look for confluence and sell (eg. Structures,  trendlines  ,  double top  on a lower time frame,  rsi  divergence,  bearish pin bar  ,  inside bar  break down etc.) (Note #2)  
5.	Stop loss to be set above  double top 
6.	Set Take Profit levels (Note #3)  

Note #1 ( Double top ):  
The first step for the formation of 2618 is to form a  double top  at key resistance levels. Why at key resistance levels? Because we want to avoid fake double tops which can occur occasionally.  

There are some variations between various resources (books, websites) regarding the definitions of “double top”. The main differences occur where:  
a)	Some said for a  double top  to be valid, the wick of the 2nd top cannot exceed the wick of the 1st top; whereas, others said:  
b)	The wick of the 2nd top can exceed the wick of the 1st top but the candle close of the 2nd top CANNOT exceed the wick of the 1st top; or  
c)	The wick of the 2nd top can exceed the wick of the 1st top and the candle close of the 2nd top CAN exceed the wick of the 1st top; or  
d)	The wick of the 2nd top meets at least the candle close of the 1st top; or  
e)	The body of the 2nd top cannot exceed the body of the 1st top  

Personally, I would say all the above definitions work just fine although I do prefer definition a) because it means that the selling pressure is strong and the bulls fail to make a higher high. When there is a higher high formed in a downtrend, it can mean the downtrend has reversed and therefore you might not want to sell when the price pulls back to the 0.618 fib retracement.  

Note #2 ( 0.618 retracement ):  
When the price pulls back to 0.618, it does not mean to sell straight away. There must be more than one reason to sell other than the 0.618 retrace. The more reasons the better. In this example, you can see there are certainly structures (key resistance levels) at the 0.618 retrace. As well, there was a  double top  formed on the lower time frame. Consequently, you can sell.  

After  BTC              hit the 0.618 retrace the first time, the price dropped from $9735 to $8650. but quickly bounced back to the 0.618 retrace level. That was a second & better opportunity to sell. Not only did  BTC              form a  double top  on the larger time frame, but also with a  bearish  divergence on the 4hr time frame. Accordingly, you have more reasons to sell.  

Note #3 (Set take profit)  
Same as the rules of “Double top”, there are some variations as to which price level should you take profits. Personally, I would stick to the below:  
1)	First, take profit when risk/reward ratio hits 1:1 (recommend to take 30% - 50% profits and adjust the SL of the remaining positions to break-even)  
2)	When price hits the same price level as the low after the neckline is broken ((b) point in this example)  
3)	When price hits 1.272 fib extension of (a)(b)  
4)	When price hits point (d) (using  AB=CD  pattern. If you are not sure what the rules of  AB=CD  are, you can refer to my previous TA in which I have attached the link below)  
5)	If in a one-way market (heavily bearish/bullish), you can always keep 10% to 20% of your positions and take profits when risk/reward ratio hits 1:5 or even 1:10

 BTC -1.78%  is on the verge of breaking to a daily higher high on the bounce if the bulls can see a push this morning. 
If we reject from here the daily will form a lower high and we will see a tightening pattern within the highlighted  support and resistance  lines.  
Important for the bulls to show up or we could stay in this range into tomorrow.  
Healthy consolidation after the most recent bull move and the 15 min chart needs to change the trend.  
Also look to  EMA  12 support on the 4 hour and hourly.  
Another morning like yesterday with the bulls comfortable as worst case, we likely stay in the tightening pattern if bulls cannot prove themselves.

The current situation of  Bitcoin -1.78%  is quite difficult. We are on a clear treshold. A lot of traders are saying that we are on a clear downtrend, but the same amount of people are claiming that we will have our reversal soon. 

This article tries to sum up all important information you have to need! 

1: Retracement of a parabolic uptrend: 
There is a rule of thumb for the retracement of a parabolic uptrend. We should retrace to approx. the 0.786  Fibonacci Retracement  +/- 10%! 
Depending where we start the count, we are already in that target. Although both ways (blue and red) have still some space for a further downwave! 







2: The bloody support of Bitcoin: 
The average cost of mining one  bitcoin -1.78%  are at USA/Russia approx. 4700$ and at 3100$ for china! 
A drop below a target of 4700$ would be savage. Nevertheless, i can't image that we will hit that target. 







3: Manipulation of  Bitcoin -1.78%  and the Bart Simpson Pattern: 
A friend of mine found some unusual patterns in the orderbooks of several exchanges: 
https://twitter.com/CryptoSyndrome 
Altcoins are manipulated on a daily basis. It seems that  bitcoin -1.78%  is now affected to this too, which causes all these 3-5% pump and dumps. 
Thus, we are forming all the time the Bartin Simpsons Patterns. 

4: Similarity to 2014: 
Bitcoin -1.78%  now: 






Bitcoin -1.78%  2014: 







5: Deminishing downtrend and a strong support 
If we see the falling  wedges  as the force of the downtrend, then the force is diminishing! 
Furthermore we have strong support which is holding now for the 4th time! 







6: The Indicators 
Having a look at the indicators at 2D, we have a good potential for an upwave now. 
The  volume  is deminishing which should indicate a breakout soon. 
The  MACD  is about to cross, the  RSI  was slightly overbought and is heading up like the  Stoch .  RSI . 
The 200  EMA  is slighty under the current price and act as a support. 

7: The symetrical Triangle 
The theory says, that we should have in a  sym -1.72% . triangle 5 times an  ABC  wave. The waves are not perfect, but we can construct them. 






As you can see, the last four ABC-Waves formed always a 1:1 extention, which indicates that we have finished wave 5. 

8: A possible Head and Shoulders 
Even if this is not the most perfect  Head and Shoulders  Pattern, it's still valid! 
We are currently at the neckline, which is a strong and important resistance. Breaking upwards should indicate a good uptrend. 







9: The magic  6th 0.00%  of the month 






Suprisingly we have on every  6th 0.00%  of the month a reversal. Why is that??? 
One reason could be the  CME Group Futures  with dates for the settlements always nearby the  6th 0.00%  of the month! 
http://www.cmegroup.com 

10: Longterm  Bullish  TA 
The whole pattern could be seen as a big  bullish pennant . 







11: Shortterm  Bullish  TA 
Leading diagonal  starting wave1 of an  Elliott Wave , since we have now an impulse wave, after the 5x  ABC  pattern inside the triangle is finished. 
Our target should be at the top of the triangle nearby 8600-8800$. 







12: Longterm  Bearish  TA 
We also can argue, that we are currenty in an downtrend and the  sym -1.72% . triangle just continuing the trend. 
Our target should be nearby 6000$ which is also a finished downwards  Elliott Wave .

Nothing is happening in the market:  volatility  has become extinct and coins' trading fallen out of fashion. Range-bound bots and robotic humans absolutely prosper in this environment. The price was unable to break the 7700 threshold. For me this is a  bearish  signal. Indicators provide mixed signals, so let's examine wave structure. The move from May 29 is a  3-wave              correction within a larger downtrend. A price drop below 7500 would confirm this scenario.

					Impulse Wave Truncation (Truncated Fifth) - 
Truncated 5th wave is when the market has become so over-extended in Wave 3 that there is not much force left for the impulse wave to come to a proper completion. So when this happens, there is a chance that the last wave of the impulse, Wave 5, will not reach the end of Wave 3 before the market starts correcting in the opposite direction. At this point, the market is just too exhausted. This condition is often called a “failure” or a “Truncation.”

I can see many people still believe that we are going inside a  descending triangle . I also believed this in my idea that i shard on may 1st: 



 

Things can change so quickly and if we didn't adapt to the changes then someone will. That's why i believe that we have to be in fast adapt mode in this market. Doesn't mean that you need to change without checking yourself. I try to find 2-3 confirmations before i change my idea on something. This includes pattern changes, trend changes etc 

There are 21 corrective wave patterns in EW which is categorized into major 3 corrective wave patterns: 

Zigzag  (5-3-5) 
Flat (3-3-5) 
Triangle (3-3-3-3-3) 

And other patterns are combinations of the above which is:  

Double three (A combination of two corrective patterns above) 
Triple three (A combination of three corrective patterns above) 

So what i can see now is that we are in two double three combination corrective wave pattern: 








More info here:  

https://elliottwave-forecast.com/elliott-wave-theory/#corrective-waves 

Confirmations: 

1. Wave ((i)) of C is 1.6k and ((v)) is going to be completed below the triangle 
2. Wave (E) of the triangle can't go beyond the triangle.  
3. This has happened twice before in 2013 & 2015 

Each wave  got 3 subwaves (a,b &c) inside and we are in the subwave c of ((y)) of Y which is an impulsive wave. 

Impulsive waves: 1,3,5,a,c 
Corrective waves: 2,4,b 

Normal Fibo Ratios for these waves are: 

wave 2 = 0.5 - 0.8 of wave 1  
wave 3 = 1.236 - 1.618 of wave 1  
wave 4 = 0.5 - 0.618 of wave 3  
wave 5 = 0.618 - 1 of wave 1  
wave B = 0.5 - 0.8 of wave A  
wave C = 0.618 - 1.236 of wave A  

Now if you check what happened in subwave a of ((y)) of Y you can see that: 

Wave (i) of a: 985$ 
Wave (ii) of a: 434$  
Wave ( iii -0.37% ) of a: 1207$  
Wave (iv) of a: 691$ [~0.618 of Wave ( iii -0.37% )] 
Wave (v) of a: 950$  








I have seen  BTC              impulsive waves fibo ratios almost the same as the previous impulsive wave fibo ratios. 
Now if you apply the same for the last wave C of (E) this is what you get: 

Wave ((i)) of c: 1587$ 
Wave ((ii)) of c  = 793$ 
Wave (( iii -0.37% )) of c  = 1961$ 
Wave ((iv)) of c [~0.618 of Wave (( iii -0.37% ))] = 1212$ 
Wave ((v)) of c  = 1587$ 








Also note that Wave ((iv)) might not retrace upto 0.618 of Wave (( iii -0.37% )) as everyone will be in panic mode by that time so minimum retracement would be around 0.386 of Wave (( iii -0.37% )) which is around 756$ and this is why i can see it goes down to 5k level or little bit more towards 4.7k which is the lowest level of the  support zone  (orange dotted lines) 








So 3 Possible Support lines for reversal would be 

1. Blue: 5800 - 6100 (Only possible if Wave ((v)) is truncated) 
2. Orange: 4700 - 5000 (This is most likely where we heading)  
3. Red: 4100 - 4400 (Only possible if Wave (( iii -0.37% )) is extended)

 Bitcoin -1.78%  has recently developed an interesting pattern of completing a  bullish  and  bearish  cycle on the sixth of every month in an alternating order. As we can see in the chart above, a fall is followed by a rise. This has happened twice before and is expected to happen again now on the  6th 0.00%  of June, 2018. This time  Bitcoin -1.78%  will finish a  bearish  cycle and I expected to begin the next  bullish  cycle at least till the end of  6th 0.00%  of July, 2018. 

This pattern of rise and fall is also supported by other patterns on the chart that signal a  bullish  reversal. The support line has also held firmly and if this pattern of alternating rise and fall ensues,  Bitcoin -1.78%  could very well make new highs by the end of the year. The  RSI  is recovering from oversold levels and has now approached a normal.  Bitcoin -1.78%  is currently at a favorable point for  bullish  entries. The price broke a long term resistance as it break past the downtrend line in April, 2018. This was a big accomplishment for the bulls but the lack of confidence pulled the price back to the support line. Currently, the price is just above the support line and appears to be all set for a  bullish  comeback but the reality is, there are not enough bulls in the market. 

The past few months have been devastating for the price of  Bitcoin -1.78%  ( BTC -1.78% ) and a lot of investors are still running scared. Institutional investors are looking for more clarity regarding regulations concerning cryptocurrencies and also safer ways to invest and store their coins. As for retail investors, most of them comprise of first time investors who have never traded any financial asset before. So, when they saw that  Bitcoin -1.78%  ( BTC -1.78% ) is making 20% gains every day, they thought this could go on forever and jumped with both feet, only to find the carpet pulled under from their feet. Big investors have always played small investors as cannon fodder and have gotten away with their schemes even in regulated markets like forex or the stock market.

Hello friends,  

It's been a while since my last post; lack of time and an urge to do more research has mainly driven me to take a break from posting ideas on TradingView. I am still in the process of doing more research and study, but I figure posting once in a while couldn't hurt. 

Since I have become recently very convinced about this, I am outlining a very possible situation with  Bitcoin -1.78%  where the  trend line  we have been on since early October breaks, reaching around a temporary low of $5000. This is examined on the  daily chart , since this is one of the best charts to examine trends of this size. I have to first and foremost say that I am not trying to spread fear, I know many people do not like to hear  bearish  ideas, but  technical analysis  is ultimately a rational exercise, and I feel that possibilities with very strong signs should be explored. 

There are a few things to look at, but I first want to talk about the big picture with, long-term  support and resistance  lines. I think most people can agree that there was a very significant downtrending resistance line that began from the peak of the  ATH 0.63%  in late December, to the low of around $6400 (thick red line). After the break from that line, it seems we moved into a sideways trend, bouncing back and forth between an emerging downtrending resistance line (light red) and a support line that we seem to have been respecting since mid-October (light green); at least this appears to be the case with the lows, where the angle's effectiveness appears very strongly. Finally, based on previous bounces, we can establish a support of around $5000-$5300 (I've thus created a small  support zone  around that range, in dark green), as well as lower supports around $3200 and $2000 (though I do not believe these will be reached, in dark green).   

Now, onto the analysis - it's no secret that  Bitcoin -1.78%  has been squeezing in, ready for a significant move either upwards or downwards. Initially I considered the upwards move to be more likely due to the significant media attention cryptocurrency has been receiving, but after viewing previous market cycles of  Bitcoin -1.78%  (check 2013), it seems clear to me that the  bearish  scenario of closing in on the market cycle is very likely, and should at the very least be prepared for with proper risk management. According to Dow Theory, which is said to have laid the foundations of modern  technical analysis , history repeats itself, and this is a situation where we forced to consider this. 

Should we break from the line, we will likely fall straight down to the $5000-$5000 area, where we will shoot back up and bounce towards around $6700 or so (maybe a little less). From there one, we will likely enter a sideways trend, which we will continue until we see higher highs and higher lows and parabolic movement returns, which could lead to us challenging the all-time high, and hitting $35k-$50k. 

NOTE: I seem to have reached the max character limit for this section of the idea, so I will continue my text below.

Comment:
					Onto the short-term: 


Scenario A: 

The reason why I have drawn this movement into a pennant is this way, is simply because we have been moving through this ascending triangle for quite a while now (May 23rd to today). I don't think that the pattern will be sufficient to directly lead into a strong sell-off, but we should consider that the size of ascending triangle suggests a small movement downwards at the very least, which can create a higher low, and thus move into position into a bearish pennant. Why would a bearish pennant occur here and not have a bounce to $8500-$8700? The reason is in positioning - the huge downtrend (May 5th to May 26th) creates a very nice flagpole in which it hits around the $5000 area very perfectly, and thus I would not be surprised if this happens. 

Second reason: on the Stoch RSI indicator on the daily chart, it appears to be dangerously high, which would suggest it being oversold. For the most part, it seems to have called lows and highs, at least to some extent. This overdrawn movement may very well have increased the likelyhood of Bitcoin being oversold. This could suggest that this is the last step into a sharp downturn, but this does not preclude Situation B. Volume has also been steadily decreasing, but this is the case with any sort of consolidation, I believe. 

Finally, the lines I have drawn below the triangle are simply bounces that I think seem fairly reasonable. The length from to support to the lines correlate with the length of the flagpole, of course, though it may seem chopped off due to the huge line from the long-term support downwards. 


Scenario B: 

This is much simpler, Bitcoin hits the upper resistance line, bounces off, challenges the lower support line, and we potentially see a break, and the rest unfolds from there. 


----------------------------------------------------------------------- 


With all this being said, do not fear if you are hoping for more parabolic movement - this likely will not be the end, and will simply be the set up for a long, drawn out sideways movement until the first signs of bullish activity begin and we start all over again. If you are longing around here, please consider using risk management, prepare for every possibility. If you are shorting, the same applies. 

Please trade with care. I wish the best to all traders!

Comment:
					This really is a very minor note, but I just want to emphasize that the rising wedge (which I erroneously refer to as an ascending triangle, a bad habit I have) entering a bearish pennant is more based on intuition than anything. Also, this pennant is mainly based on the conservative assumption that the break will happen at 7900, if it happens at 7700 where we seem to be general resistance, the pennant would look something like this:

I am Mid term-bullish on  BTC -1.78%  going into the end of this week, but looking to get into the market on a pull back to occur before I get in to the market.  The jury is still out as to whether this weekly bear trend is ready to turn around.  

We can see that both the  RSI  and  MFI  are both  Bullish  on the daily having bottomed when reaching oversold on both at c. $7k support where we found our longer term  trend line . 

We are currently in the process of meeting the Tenkan (blue line) as I write this, so in the very short term, I am looking for a pull back to $7550 range for an entry.  One of the main reasons for this is that on the 4hour timeframes we are close to completing an edge to edge trade so the risk reward doesn’t fit my profile, however a break out from the cloud or above the Tenkan around $7777 will make me enter the market. 

The  RSI  and  MFI  have both been excellent indicators in this bear market.  Whenever  RSI  has gone above the 60 and the  MFI  80; its time to exit the market from a  bullish  trade and consider shorting as it progresses higher.   

Based on the  RSI ,  MFI  trends and the fact that we will run into the Kijun at just around $8-8.2k, I will be scalling out at this  bearish  confluence level to start looking for pull backs and reassessment as i believe it to be a key point as  

Best case scenario this trade would yield a 10% return before leverage. 
This is for illustrative purposes only, please DYOR and goodluck with your trading.

So the pullback trade that we were looking at worked out & has made it's way back to the neckline level of structure. We are now at what i like to call a ""decision point"" Essentially IF price is able to violate this current level od structure THEN we're likely to continue to our next price projection.  

Something that a lot of newer traders don't understand is that when it comes to bigger moves, the market will often provide multiple opportunities to get involved. For those who don't rush and for those who don't get discouraged. If you perform consistent analysis you can often find multiple ways to involve yourself in a trade even if you missed the first strike.

This is the way markets move, If you question my charting check my previous posts. Its as simple as pie. We are going down, How long and how far is too soon to say. Here is a chart that we can understand the future price action and where to buy back. Before you guys start blasting my comment section with the time and how it may not be right thats correct. I am not calculating the time I'm just making a technical drawing of the directions that we will see in the next few months.  

Recent price action has clear signs of wash trading / market manipulation fud and lots of nonsense. Its hard to prove almost impossible so as a trader we just need to deal with it. Ideally the situation you are supposed to trade are critical break up and break down points to enter the trade. Dont enter or exit dumb trades and lose money. As an experienced trader you should be looking for shorts, I would not consider a long unless we are over $10-12k

I am never good with words so instead of writing paragraphs of clarification to justify my call for SHORT since my last posting, I have explained everything on my chart with the least words possible using Fibonacci. It does not matter how popular  Bitcoin -1.78%  has become, or how deep it has disrupted the financial sector, or how many institutional investors have come to invest in it -- the psychology behind a market cycle does not change. 

I don't really encourage anyone to short  Bitcoin -1.78% , but in all honesty, don't expect the bulls to fly anytime soon. Like I said before, this correction that we are having right now is the ""MOTHER OF ALL CORRECTIONS"" after a 4-year-long bull cycle since the 2013 correction... and we are just halfway through.

My best idea ever, taking some time off the last 2 days :) The whales just continue to play their little games by squeezing leveraged short and long positions out of the market. Can't play them, it's just too easy. Maybe it's time we retail traders stand together, combine our  volume  and use their own game against them. Yeah, maybe we could even make a blockbuster movie about this :) I love me some science fiction :) LOL  

My last update of the previous analysis i showed 2 important support levels where the price could bounce up from. The first support around 7350 did the trick and the price got pushed back to 7700. From that point on i told my members that i thought i was seeing distribution, but it was still very confusing to figure out what was going on. TA was showing  bullish  signs, that  bull flag  was very strong and was even turning slowly up and was about to squeeze upwards. But of course out of no where the price got dumped, the move we saw a few hours ago. After that 200 point drop the price got pushed up again to 7700 like that dump was a glitch. If your a whale, why not push out leveraged traders and take your money while your accumulating or distributing. It's like a bonus, like the cherry on top :)  

Anyway, in this chart we can see allot of similarities of what is going on. As you know i have been saying i am still  bearish  for the medium term, but i just could not say what was going to happen on the short term. 2 days ago after we finally dropped out of that  wedge , i said we would have 2 options.  
- Break those 2 support levels from the last update of my previous chart (73xx and 71xx) 
- Make a higher low at those same support levels and make another move up above the high.  
 
As we can see in the chart, the  fractal  is not 100% identical so it's no guarantee that the 7700 high we just saw is the high already and that we start to move down. But based on this  fractal , i don't want to see the price get above the 7800/7900. This  fractal  confirms my  bearish  view as well. That's why TA is so great, you can turn any chart to fit your view :). 

Even without this  fractal , i just give it a very small chance that 7K price action is the fundament of a low to start another bull rally, i just highly doubt that. I want to see more  volume  to begin with and at least  double bottom  kind of formation. So the minimum i expect is a test of the 7100/6900in the coming week or 2. But the movement i have in mind for the med term is a drop below the 7K to form a big V shape low. If we get to see that, than i might even become  bullish  for the rest of the year :).  

As long as the price stays above the 73xx, we have to assume the bulls are still in control and we should see another wave up. So for me the 73xx is an important turning point.

					At the moment it looks like bulls are trying to push higher, this bull flag/triangle is still very strong. So no sign of weakness yet! First small sign would be a drop below 7620/7600. Bulls need to break 7700

					This is my bigger picture, think this bearish triangle is still 100% in play. I think if bulls can't break the 7800/7900 the bearish version is probably going to happen. Can't say HOW it will go, this blue line is just a guess. But a big V shape low would be the most bullish for the long term. I still think we are seeing distribution here. The only way this idea can be countered, is through a big increase of buying volume, if that doesn't happen, i think it's only a matter of time.

					What a surprise, nothing has changed :) 

The price took a small dump but the volume was low so no real read on what the intent was. So we might see another move up, if we start to see a small pump that takes out the 7800, be aware of a fake breakout. The blue line is a possibility of what the move could look like IF we move up and if the breakout fails. If that happens than we will probably get confirmation if the price breaks the 7600ish. If we break the 7800 it should stay above the 7700 to confirm another move up. Not much more to say about what's going on.

Comment:
					So we have made a small drop, but there is no volume confirming it, not yet at least. First small support has been broken, but not yet very meaningful because of the low volume. For the ones who shorted it, just be aware of another squeeze up, since this small move downwards looks a bit to controlled.  

Pure TA, it broke the channel and retested the former support as resistance now.

901,1528359434.0,Taiwan_Bear,2618 (Double top & 0.618 pull-back) - do not miss it!!,"
In the last couple of TAs I have mentioned the “2618 pattern” and have been asked what 2618 means. Sorry for taking it so long as it took me quite a while to put everything altogether. But, as promised, I have explained below the rules and trade setups for the 2618 pattern.  

What are the rules/setups/steps for 2618?  
1.	Form a  double top  (Note #1)  
2.	Neckline has to be broken  
3.	After price found support at point (b), wait for pull back to 0.618 fib retracement of (a)(b)  
4.	After price retraced to 0.618, look for confluence and sell (eg. Structures,  trendlines  ,  double top  on a lower time frame,  rsi  divergence,  bearish pin bar  ,  inside bar  break down etc.) (Note #2)  
5.	Stop loss to be set above  double top 
6.	Set Take Profit levels (Note #3)  

Note #1 ( Double top ):  
The first step for the formation of 2618 is to form a  double top  at key resistance levels. Why at key resistance levels? Because we want to avoid fake double tops which can occur occasionally.  

There are some variations between various resources (books, websites) regarding the definitions of “double top”. The main differences occur where:  
a)	Some said for a  double top  to be valid, the wick of the 2nd top cannot exceed the wick of the 1st top; whereas, others said:  
b)	The wick of the 2nd top can exceed the wick of the 1st top but the candle close of the 2nd top CANNOT exceed the wick of the 1st top; or  
c)	The wick of the 2nd top can exceed the wick of the 1st top and the candle close of the 2nd top CAN exceed the wick of the 1st top; or  
d)	The wick of the 2nd top meets at least the candle close of the 1st top; or  
e)	The body of the 2nd top cannot exceed the body of the 1st top  

Personally, I would say all the above definitions work just fine although I do prefer definition a) because it means that the selling pressure is strong and the bulls fail to make a higher high. When there is a higher high formed in a downtrend, it can mean the downtrend has reversed and therefore you might not want to sell when the price pulls back to the 0.618 fib retracement.  

Note #2 ( 0.618 retracement ):  
When the price pulls back to 0.618, it does not mean to sell straight away. There must be more than one reason to sell other than the 0.618 retrace. The more reasons the better. In this example, you can see there are certainly structures (key resistance levels) at the 0.618 retrace. As well, there was a  double top  formed on the lower time frame. Consequently, you can sell.  

After  BTC              hit the 0.618 retrace the first time, the price dropped from $9735 to $8650. but quickly bounced back to the 0.618 retrace level. That was a second & better opportunity to sell. Not only did  BTC              form a  double top  on the larger time frame, but also with a  bearish  divergence on the 4hr time frame. Accordingly, you have more reasons to sell.  

Note #3 (Set take profit)  
Same as the rules of “Double top”, there are some variations as to which price level should you take profits. Personally, I would stick to the below:  
1)	First, take profit when risk/reward ratio hits 1:1 (recommend to take 30% - 50% profits and adjust the SL of the remaining positions to break-even)  
2)	When price hits the same price level as the low after the neckline is broken ((b) point in this example)  
3)	When price hits 1.272 fib extension of (a)(b)  
4)	When price hits point (d) (using  AB=CD  pattern. If you are not sure what the rules of  AB=CD  are, you can refer to my previous TA in which I have attached the link below)  
5)	If in a one-way market (heavily bearish/bullish), you can always keep 10% to 20% of your positions and take profits when risk/reward ratio hits 1:5 or even 1:10

 BTC -1.77%  is on the verge of breaking to a daily higher high on the bounce if the bulls can see a push this morning. 
If we reject from here the daily will form a lower high and we will see a tightening pattern within the highlighted  support and resistance  lines.  
Important for the bulls to show up or we could stay in this range into tomorrow.  
Healthy consolidation after the most recent bull move and the 15 min chart needs to change the trend.  
Also look to  EMA  12 support on the 4 hour and hourly.  
Another morning like yesterday with the bulls comfortable as worst case, we likely stay in the tightening pattern if bulls cannot prove themselves.

The current situation of  Bitcoin -1.77%  is quite difficult. We are on a clear treshold. A lot of traders are saying that we are on a clear downtrend, but the same amount of people are claiming that we will have our reversal soon. 

This article tries to sum up all important information you have to need! 

1: Retracement of a parabolic uptrend: 
There is a rule of thumb for the retracement of a parabolic uptrend. We should retrace to approx. the 0.786  Fibonacci Retracement  +/- 10%! 
Depending where we start the count, we are already in that target. Although both ways (blue and red) have still some space for a further downwave! 







2: The bloody support of Bitcoin: 
The average cost of mining one  bitcoin -1.77%  are at USA/Russia approx. 4700$ and at 3100$ for china! 
A drop below a target of 4700$ would be savage. Nevertheless, i can't image that we will hit that target. 







3: Manipulation of  Bitcoin -1.77%  and the Bart Simpson Pattern: 
A friend of mine found some unusual patterns in the orderbooks of several exchanges: 
https://twitter.com/CryptoSyndrome 
Altcoins are manipulated on a daily basis. It seems that  bitcoin -1.77%  is now affected to this too, which causes all these 3-5% pump and dumps. 
Thus, we are forming all the time the Bartin Simpsons Patterns. 

4: Similarity to 2014: 
Bitcoin -1.77%  now: 






Bitcoin -1.77%  2014: 







5: Deminishing downtrend and a strong support 
If we see the falling  wedges  as the force of the downtrend, then the force is diminishing! 
Furthermore we have strong support which is holding now for the 4th time! 







6: The Indicators 
Having a look at the indicators at 2D, we have a good potential for an upwave now. 
The  volume  is deminishing which should indicate a breakout soon. 
The  MACD  is about to cross, the  RSI  was slightly overbought and is heading up like the  Stoch .  RSI . 
The 200  EMA  is slighty under the current price and act as a support. 

7: The symetrical Triangle 
The theory says, that we should have in a  sym -1.72% . triangle 5 times an  ABC  wave. The waves are not perfect, but we can construct them. 






As you can see, the last four ABC-Waves formed always a 1:1 extention, which indicates that we have finished wave 5. 

8: A possible Head and Shoulders 
Even if this is not the most perfect  Head and Shoulders  Pattern, it's still valid! 
We are currently at the neckline, which is a strong and important resistance. Breaking upwards should indicate a good uptrend. 







9: The magic  6th 0.00%  of the month 






Suprisingly we have on every  6th 0.00%  of the month a reversal. Why is that??? 
One reason could be the  CME Group Futures  with dates for the settlements always nearby the  6th 0.00%  of the month! 
http://www.cmegroup.com 

10: Longterm  Bullish  TA 
The whole pattern could be seen as a big  bullish pennant . 







11: Shortterm  Bullish  TA 
Leading diagonal  starting wave1 of an  Elliott Wave , since we have now an impulse wave, after the 5x  ABC  pattern inside the triangle is finished. 
Our target should be at the top of the triangle nearby 8600-8800$. 







12: Longterm  Bearish  TA 
We also can argue, that we are currenty in an downtrend and the  sym -1.72% . triangle just continuing the trend. 
Our target should be nearby 6000$ which is also a finished downwards  Elliott Wave .

Nothing is happening in the market:  volatility  has become extinct and coins' trading fallen out of fashion. Range-bound bots and robotic humans absolutely prosper in this environment. The price was unable to break the 7700 threshold. For me this is a  bearish  signal. Indicators provide mixed signals, so let's examine wave structure. The move from May 29 is a  3-wave              correction within a larger downtrend. A price drop below 7500 would confirm this scenario.

					Impulse Wave Truncation (Truncated Fifth) - 
Truncated 5th wave is when the market has become so over-extended in Wave 3 that there is not much force left for the impulse wave to come to a proper completion. So when this happens, there is a chance that the last wave of the impulse, Wave 5, will not reach the end of Wave 3 before the market starts correcting in the opposite direction. At this point, the market is just too exhausted. This condition is often called a “failure” or a “Truncation.”

I can see many people still believe that we are going inside a  descending triangle . I also believed this in my idea that i shard on may 1st: 



 

Things can change so quickly and if we didn't adapt to the changes then someone will. That's why i believe that we have to be in fast adapt mode in this market. Doesn't mean that you need to change without checking yourself. I try to find 2-3 confirmations before i change my idea on something. This includes pattern changes, trend changes etc 

There are 21 corrective wave patterns in EW which is categorized into major 3 corrective wave patterns: 

Zigzag  (5-3-5) 
Flat (3-3-5) 
Triangle (3-3-3-3-3) 

And other patterns are combinations of the above which is:  

Double three (A combination of two corrective patterns above) 
Triple three (A combination of three corrective patterns above) 

So what i can see now is that we are in two double three combination corrective wave pattern: 








More info here:  

https://elliottwave-forecast.com/elliott-wave-theory/#corrective-waves 

Confirmations: 

1. Wave ((i)) of C is 1.6k and ((v)) is going to be completed below the triangle 
2. Wave (E) of the triangle can't go beyond the triangle.  
3. This has happened twice before in 2013 & 2015 

Each wave  got 3 subwaves (a,b &c) inside and we are in the subwave c of ((y)) of Y which is an impulsive wave. 

Impulsive waves: 1,3,5,a,c 
Corrective waves: 2,4,b 

Normal Fibo Ratios for these waves are: 

wave 2 = 0.5 - 0.8 of wave 1  
wave 3 = 1.236 - 1.618 of wave 1  
wave 4 = 0.5 - 0.618 of wave 3  
wave 5 = 0.618 - 1 of wave 1  
wave B = 0.5 - 0.8 of wave A  
wave C = 0.618 - 1.236 of wave A  

Now if you check what happened in subwave a of ((y)) of Y you can see that: 

Wave (i) of a: 985$ 
Wave (ii) of a: 434$  
Wave ( iii -0.35% ) of a: 1207$  
Wave (iv) of a: 691$ [~0.618 of Wave ( iii -0.35% )] 
Wave (v) of a: 950$  








I have seen  BTC -1.77%  impulsive waves fibo ratios almost the same as the previous impulsive wave fibo ratios. 
Now if you apply the same for the last wave C of (E) this is what you get: 

Wave ((i)) of c: 1587$ 
Wave ((ii)) of c  = 793$ 
Wave (( iii -0.35% )) of c  = 1961$ 
Wave ((iv)) of c [~0.618 of Wave (( iii -0.35% ))] = 1212$ 
Wave ((v)) of c  = 1587$ 








Also note that Wave ((iv)) might not retrace upto 0.618 of Wave (( iii -0.35% )) as everyone will be in panic mode by that time so minimum retracement would be around 0.386 of Wave (( iii -0.35% )) which is around 756$ and this is why i can see it goes down to 5k level or little bit more towards 4.7k which is the lowest level of the  support zone  (orange dotted lines) 








So 3 Possible Support lines for reversal would be 

1. Blue: 5800 - 6100 (Only possible if Wave ((v)) is truncated) 
2. Orange: 4700 - 5000 (This is most likely where we heading)  
3. Red: 4100 - 4400 (Only possible if Wave (( iii -0.35% )) is extended)

 Bitcoin -1.77%  has recently developed an interesting pattern of completing a  bullish  and  bearish  cycle on the sixth of every month in an alternating order. As we can see in the chart above, a fall is followed by a rise. This has happened twice before and is expected to happen again now on the  6th 0.00%  of June, 2018. This time  Bitcoin -1.77%  will finish a  bearish  cycle and I expected to begin the next  bullish  cycle at least till the end of  6th 0.00%  of July, 2018. 

This pattern of rise and fall is also supported by other patterns on the chart that signal a  bullish  reversal. The support line has also held firmly and if this pattern of alternating rise and fall ensues,  Bitcoin -1.77%  could very well make new highs by the end of the year. The  RSI  is recovering from oversold levels and has now approached a normal.  Bitcoin -1.77%  is currently at a favorable point for  bullish  entries. The price broke a long term resistance as it break past the downtrend line in April, 2018. This was a big accomplishment for the bulls but the lack of confidence pulled the price back to the support line. Currently, the price is just above the support line and appears to be all set for a  bullish  comeback but the reality is, there are not enough bulls in the market. 

The past few months have been devastating for the price of  Bitcoin -1.77%  ( BTC -1.77% ) and a lot of investors are still running scared. Institutional investors are looking for more clarity regarding regulations concerning cryptocurrencies and also safer ways to invest and store their coins. As for retail investors, most of them comprise of first time investors who have never traded any financial asset before. So, when they saw that  Bitcoin -1.77%  ( BTC -1.77% ) is making 20% gains every day, they thought this could go on forever and jumped with both feet, only to find the carpet pulled under from their feet. Big investors have always played small investors as cannon fodder and have gotten away with their schemes even in regulated markets like forex or the stock market. Cryptocurrencies is a new market with no proper regulations which means it is natural to expect that those who can afford to not play by the rules, most likely won’t.

Hello friends,  

It's been a while since my last post; lack of time and an urge to do more research has mainly driven me to take a break from posting ideas on TradingView. I am still in the process of doing more research and study, but I figure posting once in a while couldn't hurt. 

Since I have become recently very convinced about this, I am outlining a very possible situation with  Bitcoin              where the  trend line  we have been on since early October breaks, reaching around a temporary low of $5000. This is examined on the  daily chart , since this is one of the best charts to examine trends of this size. I have to first and foremost say that I am not trying to spread fear, I know many people do not like to hear  bearish  ideas, but  technical analysis  is ultimately a rational exercise, and I feel that possibilities with very strong signs should be explored. 

There are a few things to look at, but I first want to talk about the big picture with, long-term  support and resistance  lines. I think most people can agree that there was a very significant downtrending resistance line that began from the peak of the  ATH              in late December, to the low of around $6400 (thick red line). After the break from that line, it seems we moved into a sideways trend, bouncing back and forth between an emerging downtrending resistance line (light red) and a support line that we seem to have been respecting since mid-October (light green); at least this appears to be the case with the lows, where the angle's effectiveness appears very strongly. Finally, based on previous bounces, we can establish a support of around $5000-$5300 (I've thus created a small  support zone  around that range, in dark green), as well as lower supports around $3200 and $2000 (though I do not believe these will be reached, in dark green).   

Now, onto the analysis - it's no secret that  Bitcoin              has been squeezing in, ready for a significant move either upwards or downwards. Initially I considered the upwards move to be more likely due to the significant media attention cryptocurrency has been receiving, but after viewing previous market cycles of  Bitcoin              (check 2013), it seems clear to me that the  bearish  scenario of closing in on the market cycle is very likely, and should at the very least be prepared for with proper risk management. According to Dow Theory, which is said to have laid the foundations of modern  technical analysis , history repeats itself, and this is a situation where we forced to consider this. 

Should we break from the line, we will likely fall straight down to the $5000-$5000 area, where we will shoot back up and bounce towards around $6700 or so (maybe a little less). From there one, we will likely enter a sideways trend, which we will continue until we see higher highs and higher lows and parabolic movement returns, which could lead to us challenging the all-time high, and hitting $35k-$50k. 

NOTE: I seem to have reached the max character limit for this section of the idea, so I will continue my text below.

Comment:
					Onto the short-term: 


Scenario A: 

The reason why I have drawn this movement into a pennant is this way, is simply because we have been moving through this ascending triangle for quite a while now (May 23rd to today). I don't think that the pattern will be sufficient to directly lead into a strong sell-off, but we should consider that the size of ascending triangle suggests a small movement downwards at the very least, which can create a higher low, and thus move into position into a bearish pennant. Why would a bearish pennant occur here and not have a bounce to $8500-$8700? The reason is in positioning - the huge downtrend (May 5th to May 26th) creates a very nice flagpole in which it hits around the $5000 area very perfectly, and thus I would not be surprised if this happens. 

Second reason: on the Stoch RSI indicator on the daily chart, it appears to be dangerously high, which would suggest it being oversold. For the most part, it seems to have called lows and highs, at least to some extent. This overdrawn movement may very well have increased the likelyhood of Bitcoin being oversold. This could suggest that this is the last step into a sharp downturn, but this does not preclude Situation B. Volume has also been steadily decreasing, but this is the case with any sort of consolidation, I believe. 

Finally, the lines I have drawn below the triangle are simply bounces that I think seem fairly reasonable. The length from to support to the lines correlate with the length of the flagpole, of course, though it may seem chopped off due to the huge line from the long-term support downwards. 


Scenario B: 

This is much simpler, Bitcoin hits the upper resistance line, bounces off, challenges the lower support line, and we potentially see a break, and the rest unfolds from there. 


----------------------------------------------------------------------- 


With all this being said, do not fear if you are hoping for more parabolic movement - this likely will not be the end, and will simply be the set up for a long, drawn out sideways movement until the first signs of bullish activity begin and we start all over again. If you are longing around here, please consider using risk management, prepare for every possibility. If you are shorting, the same applies. 

Please trade with care. I wish the best to all traders!

Comment:
					This really is a very minor note, but I just want to emphasize that the rising wedge (which I erroneously refer to as an ascending triangle, a bad habit I have) entering a bearish pennant is more based on intuition than anything. Also, this pennant is mainly based on the conservative assumption that the break will happen at 7900, if it happens at 7700 where we seem to be general resistance, the pennant would look something like this:

Jun 7




I am Mid term-bullish on  BTC -1.77%  going into the end of this week, but looking to get into the market on a pull back to occur before I get in to the market.  The jury is still out as to whether this weekly bear trend is ready to turn around.  

We can see that both the  RSI  and  MFI  are both  Bullish  on the daily having bottomed when reaching oversold on both at c. $7k support where we found our longer term  trend line . 

We are currently in the process of meeting the Tenkan (blue line) as I write this, so in the very short term, I am looking for a pull back to $7550 range for an entry.  One of the main reasons for this is that on the 4hour timeframes we are close to completing an edge to edge trade so the risk reward doesn’t fit my profile, however a break out from the cloud or above the Tenkan around $7777 will make me enter the market. 

The  RSI  and  MFI  have both been excellent indicators in this bear market.  Whenever  RSI  has gone above the 60 and the  MFI  80; its time to exit the market from a  bullish  trade and consider shorting as it progresses higher.   

Based on the  RSI ,  MFI  trends and the fact that we will run into the Kijun at just around $8-8.2k, I will be scalling out at this  bearish  confluence level to start looking for pull backs and reassessment as i believe it to be a key point as  

Best case scenario this trade would yield a 10% return before leverage. 
This is for illustrative purposes only, please DYOR and goodluck with your trading.

So the pullback trade that we were looking at worked out & has made it's way back to the neckline level of structure. We are now at what i like to call a ""decision point"" Essentially IF price is able to violate this current level od structure THEN we're likely to continue to our next price projection.  

Something that a lot of newer traders don't understand is that when it comes to bigger moves, the market will often provide multiple opportunities to get involved. For those who don't rush and for those who don't get discouraged. If you perform consistent analysis you can often find multiple ways to involve yourself in a trade even if you missed the first strike.

Recent price action has clear signs of wash trading / market manipulation fud and lots of nonsense. Its hard to prove almost impossible so as a trader we just need to deal with it. Ideally the situation you are supposed to trade are critical break up and break down points to enter the trade. Dont enter or exit dumb trades and lose money.

My best idea ever, taking some time off the last 2 days :) The whales just continue to play their little games by squeezing leveraged short and long positions out of the market. Can't play them, it's just too easy. Maybe it's time we retail traders stand together, combine our  volume  and use their own game against them. Yeah, maybe we could even make a blockbuster movie about this :) I love me some science fiction :) LOL  

My last update of the previous analysis i showed 2 important support levels where the price could bounce up from. The first support around 7350 did the trick and the price got pushed back to 7700. From that point on i told my members that i thought i was seeing distribution, but it was still very confusing to figure out what was going on. TA was showing  bullish  signs, that  bull flag  was very strong and was even turning slowly up and was about to squeeze upwards. But of course out of no where the price got dumped, the move we saw a few hours ago. After that 200 point drop the price got pushed up again to 7700 like that dump was a glitch. If your a whale, why not push out leveraged traders and take your money while your accumulating or distributing. It's like a bonus, like the cherry on top :)  

Anyway, in this chart we can see allot of similarities of what is going on. As you know i have been saying i am still  bearish  for the medium term, but i just could not say what was going to happen on the short term. 2 days ago after we finally dropped out of that  wedge , i said we would have 2 options.  
- Break those 2 support levels from the last update of my previous chart (73xx and 71xx) 
- Make a higher low at those same support levels and make another move up above the high.  
 
As we can see in the chart, the  fractal  is not 100% identical so it's no guarantee that the 7700 high we just saw is the high already and that we start to move down. But based on this  fractal , i don't want to see the price get above the 7800/7900. This  fractal  confirms my  bearish  view as well. That's why TA is so great, you can turn any chart to fit your view :). 

Even without this  fractal , i just give it a very small chance that 7K price action is the fundament of a low to start another bull rally, i just highly doubt that. I want to see more  volume  to begin with and at least  double bottom  kind of formation. So the minimum i expect is a test of the 7100/6900in the coming week or 2. But the movement i have in mind for the med term is a drop below the 7K to form a big V shape low. If we get to see that, than i might even become  bullish  for the rest of the year :).  

As long as the price stays above the 73xx, we have to assume the bulls are still in control and we should see another wave up. So for me the 73xx is an important turning point.

					At the moment it looks like bulls are trying to push higher, this bull flag/triangle is still very strong. So no sign of weakness yet! First small sign would be a drop below 7620/7600. Bulls need to break 7700

					This is my bigger picture, think this bearish triangle is still 100% in play. I think if bulls can't break the 7800/7900 the bearish version is probably going to happen. Can't say HOW it will go, this blue line is just a guess. But a big V shape low would be the most bullish for the long term. I still think we are seeing distribution here. The only way this idea can be countered, is through a big increase of buying volume, if that doesn't happen, i think it's only a matter of time.

So we might see another move up, if we start to see a small pump that takes out the 7800, be aware of a fake breakout. The blue line is a possibility of what the move could look like IF we move up and if the breakout fails. If that happens than we will probably get confirmation if the price breaks the 7600ish. If we break the 7800 it should stay above the 7700 to confirm another move up. Not much more to say about what's going on.

Comment:
					So we have made a small drop, but there is no volume confirming it, not yet at least. First small support has been broken, but not yet very meaningful because of the low volume. For the ones who shorted it, just be aware of another squeeze up, since this small move downwards looks a bit to controlled.  

Pure TA, it broke the channel and retested the former support as resistance now.

919,1528359434.0,Taiwan_Bear,2618 (Double top & 0.618 pull-back) - do not miss it!!,"
In the last couple of TAs I have mentioned the “2618 pattern” and have been asked what 2618 means. Sorry for taking it so long as it took me quite a while to put everything altogether. But, as promised, I have explained below the rules and trade setups for the 2618 pattern.  

What are the rules/setups/steps for 2618?  
1.	Form a  double top  (Note #1)  
2.	Neckline has to be broken  
3.	After price found support at point (b), wait for pull back to 0.618 fib retracement of (a)(b)  
4.	After price retraced to 0.618, look for confluence and sell (eg. Structures,  trendlines  ,  double top  on a lower time frame,  rsi  divergence,  bearish pin bar  ,  inside bar  break down etc.) (Note #2)  
5.	Stop loss to be set above  double top 
6.	Set Take Profit levels (Note #3)  

Note #1 ( Double top ):  
The first step for the formation of 2618 is to form a  double top  at key resistance levels. Why at key resistance levels? Because we want to avoid fake double tops which can occur occasionally.  

There are some variations between various resources (books, websites) regarding the definitions of “double top”. The main differences occur where:  
a)	Some said for a  double top  to be valid, the wick of the 2nd top cannot exceed the wick of the 1st top; whereas, others said:  
b)	The wick of the 2nd top can exceed the wick of the 1st top but the candle close of the 2nd top CANNOT exceed the wick of the 1st top; or  
c)	The wick of the 2nd top can exceed the wick of the 1st top and the candle close of the 2nd top CAN exceed the wick of the 1st top; or  
d)	The wick of the 2nd top meets at least the candle close of the 1st top; or  
e)	The body of the 2nd top cannot exceed the body of the 1st top  

Personally, I would say all the above definitions work just fine although I do prefer definition a) because it means that the selling pressure is strong and the bulls fail to make a higher high. When there is a higher high formed in a downtrend, it can mean the downtrend has reversed and therefore you might not want to sell when the price pulls back to the 0.618 fib retracement.  

Note #2 ( 0.618 retracement ):  
When the price pulls back to 0.618, it does not mean to sell straight away. There must be more than one reason to sell other than the 0.618 retrace. The more reasons the better. In this example, you can see there are certainly structures (key resistance levels) at the 0.618 retrace. As well, there was a  double top  formed on the lower time frame. Consequently, you can sell.  

After  BTC -1.72%  hit the 0.618 retrace the first time, the price dropped from $9735 to $8650. but quickly bounced back to the 0.618 retrace level. That was a second & better opportunity to sell. Not only did  BTC -1.72%  form a  double top  on the larger time frame, but also with a  bearish  divergence on the 4hr time frame. Accordingly, you have more reasons to sell.  

Note #3 (Set take profit)  
Same as the rules of “Double top”, there are some variations as to which price level should you take profits. Personally, I would stick to the below:  
1)	First, take profit when risk/reward ratio hits 1:1 (recommend to take 30% - 50% profits and adjust the SL of the remaining positions to break-even)  
2)	When price hits the same price level as the low after the neckline is broken ((b) point in this example)  
3)	When price hits 1.272 fib extension of (a)(b)  
4)	When price hits point (d) (using  AB=CD  pattern. If you are not sure what the rules of  AB=CD  are, you can refer to my previous TA in which I have attached the link below)  
5)	If in a one-way market (heavily bearish/bullish), you can always keep 10% to 20% of your positions and take profits when risk/reward ratio hits 1:5 or even 1:10

 BTC              is on the verge of breaking to a daily higher high on the bounce if the bulls can see a push this morning. 
If we reject from here the daily will form a lower high and we will see a tightening pattern within the highlighted  support and resistance  lines.  
Important for the bulls to show up or we could stay in this range into tomorrow.  
Healthy consolidation after the most recent bull move and the 15 min chart needs to change the trend.  
Also look to  EMA  12 support on the 4 hour and hourly.  
Another morning like yesterday with the bulls comfortable as worst case, we likely stay in the tightening pattern if bulls cannot prove themselves.

The current situation of  Bitcoin -1.72%  is quite difficult. We are on a clear treshold. A lot of traders are saying that we are on a clear downtrend, but the same amount of people are claiming that we will have our reversal soon. 

This article tries to sum up all important information you have to need! 

1: Retracement of a parabolic uptrend: 
There is a rule of thumb for the retracement of a parabolic uptrend. We should retrace to approx. the 0.786  Fibonacci Retracement  +/- 10%! 
Depending where we start the count, we are already in that target. Although both ways (blue and red) have still some space for a further downwave! 







2: The bloody support of Bitcoin: 
The average cost of mining one  bitcoin -1.72%  are at USA/Russia approx. 4700$ and at 3100$ for china! 
A drop below a target of 4700$ would be savage. Nevertheless, i can't image that we will hit that target. 







3: Manipulation of  Bitcoin -1.72%  and the Bart Simpson Pattern: 
A friend of mine found some unusual patterns in the orderbooks of several exchanges: 
https://twitter.com/CryptoSyndrome 
Altcoins are manipulated on a daily basis. It seems that  bitcoin -1.72%  is now affected to this too, which causes all these 3-5% pump and dumps. 
Thus, we are forming all the time the Bartin Simpsons Patterns. 

4: Similarity to 2014: 
Bitcoin -1.72%  now: 






Bitcoin -1.72%  2014: 







5: Deminishing downtrend and a strong support 
If we see the falling  wedges  as the force of the downtrend, then the force is diminishing! 
Furthermore we have strong support which is holding now for the 4th time! 







6: The Indicators 
Having a look at the indicators at 2D, we have a good potential for an upwave now. 
The  volume  is deminishing which should indicate a breakout soon. 
The  MACD  is about to cross, the  RSI  was slightly overbought and is heading up like the  Stoch .  RSI . 
The 200  EMA  is slighty under the current price and act as a support. 

7: The symetrical Triangle 
The theory says, that we should have in a  sym -0.80% . triangle 5 times an  ABC  wave. The waves are not perfect, but we can construct them. 






As you can see, the last four ABC-Waves formed always a 1:1 extention, which indicates that we have finished wave 5. 

8: A possible Head and Shoulders 
Even if this is not the most perfect  Head and Shoulders  Pattern, it's still valid! 
We are currently at the neckline, which is a strong and important resistance. Breaking upwards should indicate a good uptrend. 







9: The magic  6th 0.00%  of the month 






Suprisingly we have on every  6th 0.00%  of the month a reversal. Why is that??? 
One reason could be the  CME Group Futures  with dates for the settlements always nearby the  6th 0.00%  of the month! 
http://www.cmegroup.com 

10: Longterm  Bullish  TA 
The whole pattern could be seen as a big  bullish pennant . 







11: Shortterm  Bullish  TA 
Leading diagonal  starting wave1 of an  Elliott Wave , since we have now an impulse wave, after the 5x  ABC  pattern inside the triangle is finished. 
Our target should be at the top of the triangle nearby 8600-8800$. 







12: Longterm  Bearish  TA 
We also can argue, that we are currenty in an downtrend and the  sym -0.80% . triangle just continuing the trend. 
Our target should be nearby 6000$ which is also a finished downwards  Elliott Wave .

Nothing is happening in the market:  volatility  has become extinct and coins' trading fallen out of fashion. Range-bound bots and robotic humans absolutely prosper in this environment. The price was unable to break the 7700 threshold. For me this is a  bearish  signal. Indicators provide mixed signals, so let's examine wave structure. The move from May 29 is a  3-wave -0.12%  correction within a larger downtrend. A price drop below 7500 would confirm this scenario.

					Impulse Wave Truncation (Truncated Fifth) - 
Truncated 5th wave is when the market has become so over-extended in Wave 3 that there is not much force left for the impulse wave to come to a proper completion. So when this happens, there is a chance that the last wave of the impulse, Wave 5, will not reach the end of Wave 3 before the market starts correcting in the opposite direction. At this point, the market is just too exhausted. This condition is often called a “failure” or a “Truncation.”

I can see many people still believe that we are going inside a  descending triangle . I also believed this in my idea that i shard on may 1st: 



 

Things can change so quickly and if we didn't adapt to the changes then someone will. That's why i believe that we have to be in fast adapt mode in this market. Doesn't mean that you need to change without checking yourself. I try to find 2-3 confirmations before i change my idea on something. This includes pattern changes, trend changes etc 

There are 21 corrective wave patterns in EW which is categorized into major 3 corrective wave patterns: 

Zigzag  (5-3-5) 
Flat (3-3-5) 
Triangle (3-3-3-3-3) 

And other patterns are combinations of the above which is:  

Double three (A combination of two corrective patterns above) 
Triple three (A combination of three corrective patterns above) 

So what i can see now is that we are in two double three combination corrective wave pattern: 








More info here:  

https://elliottwave-forecast.com/elliott-wave-theory/#corrective-waves 

Confirmations: 

1. Wave ((i)) of C is 1.6k and ((v)) is going to be completed below the triangle 
2. Wave (E) of the triangle can't go beyond the triangle.  
3. This has happened twice before in 2013 & 2015 

Each wave  got 3 subwaves (a,b &c) inside and we are in the subwave c of ((y)) of Y which is an impulsive wave. 

Impulsive waves: 1,3,5,a,c 
Corrective waves: 2,4,b 

Normal Fibo Ratios for these waves are: 

wave 2 = 0.5 - 0.8 of wave 1  
wave 3 = 1.236 - 1.618 of wave 1  
wave 4 = 0.5 - 0.618 of wave 3  
wave 5 = 0.618 - 1 of wave 1  
wave B = 0.5 - 0.8 of wave A  
wave C = 0.618 - 1.236 of wave A  

Now if you check what happened in subwave a of ((y)) of Y you can see that: 

Wave (i) of a: 985$ 
Wave (ii) of a: 434$  
Wave ( iii -0.38% ) of a: 1207$  
Wave (iv) of a: 691$ [~0.618 of Wave ( iii -0.38% )] 
Wave (v) of a: 950$  








I have seen  BTC -1.72%  impulsive waves fibo ratios almost the same as the previous impulsive wave fibo ratios. 
Now if you apply the same for the last wave C of (E) this is what you get: 

Wave ((i)) of c: 1587$ 
Wave ((ii)) of c  = 793$ 
Wave (( iii -0.38% )) of c  = 1961$ 
Wave ((iv)) of c [~0.618 of Wave (( iii -0.38% ))] = 1212$ 
Wave ((v)) of c  = 1587$ 








Also note that Wave ((iv)) might not retrace upto 0.618 of Wave (( iii -0.38% )) as everyone will be in panic mode by that time so minimum retracement would be around 0.386 of Wave (( iii -0.38% )) which is around 756$ and this is why i can see it goes down to 5k level or little bit more towards 4.7k which is the lowest level of the  support zone  (orange dotted lines) 








So 3 Possible Support lines for reversal would be 

1. Blue: 5800 - 6100 (Only possible if Wave ((v)) is truncated) 
2. Orange: 4700 - 5000 (This is most likely where we heading)  
3. Red: 4100 - 4400 (Only possible if Wave (( iii -0.38% )) is extended)

 Bitcoin -1.74%  has recently developed an interesting pattern of completing a  bullish  and  bearish  cycle on the sixth of every month in an alternating order. As we can see in the chart above, a fall is followed by a rise. This has happened twice before and is expected to happen again now on the  6th 0.00%  of June, 2018. This time  Bitcoin -1.74%  will finish a  bearish  cycle and I expected to begin the next  bullish  cycle at least till the end of  6th 0.00%  of July, 2018. 

This pattern of rise and fall is also supported by other patterns on the chart that signal a  bullish  reversal. The support line has also held firmly and if this pattern of alternating rise and fall ensues,  Bitcoin -1.74%  could very well make new highs by the end of the year. The  RSI  is recovering from oversold levels and has now approached a normal.  Bitcoin -1.74%  is currently at a favorable point for  bullish  entries. The price broke a long term resistance as it break past the downtrend line in April, 2018. This was a big accomplishment for the bulls but the lack of confidence pulled the price back to the support line. Currently, the price is just above the support line and appears to be all set for a  bullish  comeback but the reality is, there are not enough bulls in the market. 

The past few months have been devastating for the price of  Bitcoin -1.74%  ( BTC -1.74% ) and a lot of investors are still running scared. Institutional investors are looking for more clarity regarding regulations concerning cryptocurrencies and also safer ways to invest and store their coins. As for retail investors, most of them comprise of first time investors who have never traded any financial asset before. So, when they saw that  Bitcoin -1.74%  ( BTC -1.74% ) is making 20% gains every day, they thought this could go on forever and jumped with both feet, only to find the carpet pulled under from their feet. Big investors have always played small investors as cannon fodder and have gotten away with their schemes even in regulated markets like forex or the stock market. Cryptocurrencies is a new market with no proper regulations which means it is natural to expect that those who can afford to not play by the rules, most likely won’t.

Hello friends,  

It's been a while since my last post; lack of time and an urge to do more research has mainly driven me to take a break from posting ideas on TradingView. I am still in the process of doing more research and study, but I figure posting once in a while couldn't hurt. 

Since I have become recently very convinced about this, I am outlining a very possible situation with  Bitcoin -1.75%  where the  trend line  we have been on since early October breaks, reaching around a temporary low of $5000. This is examined on the  daily chart , since this is one of the best charts to examine trends of this size. I have to first and foremost say that I am not trying to spread fear, I know many people do not like to hear  bearish  ideas, but  technical analysis  is ultimately a rational exercise, and I feel that possibilities with very strong signs should be explored. 

There are a few things to look at, but I first want to talk about the big picture with, long-term  support and resistance  lines. I think most people can agree that there was a very significant downtrending resistance line that began from the peak of the  ATH 0.63%  in late December, to the low of around $6400 (thick red line). After the break from that line, it seems we moved into a sideways trend, bouncing back and forth between an emerging downtrending resistance line (light red) and a support line that we seem to have been respecting since mid-October (light green); at least this appears to be the case with the lows, where the angle's effectiveness appears very strongly. Finally, based on previous bounces, we can establish a support of around $5000-$5300 (I've thus created a small  support zone  around that range, in dark green), as well as lower supports around $3200 and $2000 (though I do not believe these will be reached, in dark green).   

Now, onto the analysis - it's no secret that  Bitcoin -1.75%  has been squeezing in, ready for a significant move either upwards or downwards. Initially I considered the upwards move to be more likely due to the significant media attention cryptocurrency has been receiving, but after viewing previous market cycles of  Bitcoin -1.75%  (check 2013), it seems clear to me that the  bearish  scenario of closing in on the market cycle is very likely, and should at the very least be prepared for with proper risk management. According to Dow Theory, which is said to have laid the foundations of modern  technical analysis , history repeats itself, and this is a situation where we forced to consider this. 

Should we break from the line, we will likely fall straight down to the $5000-$5000 area, where we will shoot back up and bounce towards around $6700 or so (maybe a little less). From there one, we will likely enter a sideways trend, which we will continue until we see higher highs and higher lows and parabolic movement returns, which could lead to us challenging the all-time high, and hitting $35k-$50k. 

NOTE: I seem to have reached the max character limit for this section of the idea, so I will continue my text below.

Comment:
					Onto the short-term: 


Scenario A: 

The reason why I have drawn this movement into a pennant is this way, is simply because we have been moving through this ascending triangle for quite a while now (May 23rd to today). I don't think that the pattern will be sufficient to directly lead into a strong sell-off, but we should consider that the size of ascending triangle suggests a small movement downwards at the very least, which can create a higher low, and thus move into position into a bearish pennant. Why would a bearish pennant occur here and not have a bounce to $8500-$8700? The reason is in positioning - the huge downtrend (May 5th to May 26th) creates a very nice flagpole in which it hits around the $5000 area very perfectly, and thus I would not be surprised if this happens. 

Second reason: on the Stoch RSI indicator on the daily chart, it appears to be dangerously high, which would suggest it being oversold. For the most part, it seems to have called lows and highs, at least to some extent. This overdrawn movement may very well have increased the likelyhood of Bitcoin being oversold. This could suggest that this is the last step into a sharp downturn, but this does not preclude Situation B. Volume has also been steadily decreasing, but this is the case with any sort of consolidation, I believe. 

Finally, the lines I have drawn below the triangle are simply bounces that I think seem fairly reasonable. The length from to support to the lines correlate with the length of the flagpole, of course, though it may seem chopped off due to the huge line from the long-term support downwards. 


Scenario B: 

This is much simpler, Bitcoin hits the upper resistance line, bounces off, challenges the lower support line, and we potentially see a break, and the rest unfolds from there. 


----------------------------------------------------------------------- 


With all this being said, do not fear if you are hoping for more parabolic movement - this likely will not be the end, and will simply be the set up for a long, drawn out sideways movement until the first signs of bullish activity begin and we start all over again. If you are longing around here, please consider using risk management, prepare for every possibility. If you are shorting, the same applies. 

Please trade with care. I wish the best to all traders!

Comment:
					This really is a very minor note, but I just want to emphasize that the rising wedge (which I erroneously refer to as an ascending triangle, a bad habit I have) entering a bearish pennant is more based on intuition than anything. Also, this pennant is mainly based on the conservative assumption that the break will happen at 7900, if it happens at 7700 where we seem to be general resistance, the pennant would look something like this:

Jun 7




I am Mid term-bullish on  BTC -1.75%  going into the end of this week, but looking to get into the market on a pull back to occur before I get in to the market.  The jury is still out as to whether this weekly bear trend is ready to turn around.  

We can see that both the  RSI  and  MFI  are both  Bullish  on the daily having bottomed when reaching oversold on both at c. $7k support where we found our longer term  trend line . 

We are currently in the process of meeting the Tenkan (blue line) as I write this, so in the very short term, I am looking for a pull back to $7550 range for an entry.  One of the main reasons for this is that on the 4hour timeframes we are close to completing an edge to edge trade so the risk reward doesn’t fit my profile, however a break out from the cloud or above the Tenkan around $7777 will make me enter the market. 

The  RSI  and  MFI  have both been excellent indicators in this bear market.  Whenever  RSI  has gone above the 60 and the  MFI  80; its time to exit the market from a  bullish  trade and consider shorting as it progresses higher.   

Based on the  RSI ,  MFI  trends and the fact that we will run into the Kijun at just around $8-8.2k, I will be scalling out at this  bearish  confluence level to start looking for pull backs and reassessment as i believe it to be a key point as  

Best case scenario this trade would yield a 10% return before leverage. 
This is for illustrative purposes only, please DYOR and goodluck with your trading.

So the pullback trade that we were looking at worked out & has made it's way back to the neckline level of structure. We are now at what i like to call a ""decision point"" Essentially IF price is able to violate this current level od structure THEN we're likely to continue to our next price projection.  

Something that a lot of newer traders don't understand is that when it comes to bigger moves, the market will often provide multiple opportunities to get involved. For those who don't rush and for those who don't get discouraged. If you perform consistent analysis you can often find multiple ways to involve yourself in a trade even if you missed the first strike.

This is the way markets move, If you question my charting check my previous posts. Its as simple as pie. We are going down, How long and how far is too soon to say. Here is a chart that we can understand the future price action and where to buy back. Before you guys start blasting my comment section with the time and how it may not be right thats correct. I am not calculating the time I'm just making a technical drawing of the directions that we will see in the next few months.  

Recent price action has clear signs of wash trading / market manipulation fud and lots of nonsense. Its hard to prove almost impossible so as a trader we just need to deal with it. Ideally the situation you are supposed to trade are critical break up and break down points to enter the trade. Dont enter or exit dumb trades and lose money. As an experienced trader you should be looking for shorts, I would not consider a long unless we are over $10-12k

I am never good with words so instead of writing paragraphs of clarification to justify my call for SHORT since my last posting, I have explained everything on my chart with the least words possible using Fibonacci. It does not matter how popular  Bitcoin -1.75%  has become, or how deep it has disrupted the financial sector, or how many institutional investors have come to invest in it -- the psychology behind a market cycle does not change. 

I don't really encourage anyone to short  Bitcoin -1.75% , but in all honesty, don't expect the bulls to fly anytime soon. Like I said before, this correction that we are having right now is the ""MOTHER OF ALL CORRECTIONS"" after a 4-year-long bull cycle since the 2013 correction... and we are just halfway through.

My best idea ever, taking some time off the last 2 days :) The whales just continue to play their little games by squeezing leveraged short and long positions out of the market. Can't play them, it's just too easy. Maybe it's time we retail traders stand together, combine our  volume  and use their own game against them. Yeah, maybe we could even make a blockbuster movie about this :) I love me some science fiction :) LOL  

My last update of the previous analysis i showed 2 important support levels where the price could bounce up from. The first support around 7350 did the trick and the price got pushed back to 7700. From that point on i told my members that i thought i was seeing distribution, but it was still very confusing to figure out what was going on. TA was showing  bullish  signs, that  bull flag  was very strong and was even turning slowly up and was about to squeeze upwards. But of course out of no where the price got dumped, the move we saw a few hours ago. After that 200 point drop the price got pushed up again to 7700 like that dump was a glitch. If your a whale, why not push out leveraged traders and take your money while your accumulating or distributing. It's like a bonus, like the cherry on top :)  

Anyway, in this chart we can see allot of similarities of what is going on. As you know i have been saying i am still  bearish  for the medium term, but i just could not say what was going to happen on the short term. 2 days ago after we finally dropped out of that  wedge , i said we would have 2 options.  
- Break those 2 support levels from the last update of my previous chart (73xx and 71xx) 
- Make a higher low at those same support levels and make another move up above the high.  
 
As we can see in the chart, the  fractal  is not 100% identical so it's no guarantee that the 7700 high we just saw is the high already and that we start to move down. But based on this  fractal , i don't want to see the price get above the 7800/7900. This  fractal  confirms my  bearish  view as well. That's why TA is so great, you can turn any chart to fit your view :). 

Even without this  fractal , i just give it a very small chance that 7K price action is the fundament of a low to start another bull rally, i just highly doubt that. I want to see more  volume  to begin with and at least  double bottom  kind of formation. So the minimum i expect is a test of the 7100/6900in the coming week or 2. But the movement i have in mind for the med term is a drop below the 7K to form a big V shape low. If we get to see that, than i might even become  bullish  for the rest of the year :).  

As long as the price stays above the 73xx, we have to assume the bulls are still in control and we should see another wave up. So for me the 73xx is an important turning point.

					At the moment it looks like bulls are trying to push higher, this bull flag/triangle is still very strong. So no sign of weakness yet! First small sign would be a drop below 7620/7600. Bulls need to break 7700

Comment:
					This is my bigger picture, think this bearish triangle is still 100% in play. I think if bulls can't break the 7800/7900 the bearish version is probably going to happen. Can't say HOW it will go, this blue line is just a guess. But a big V shape low would be the most bullish for the long term. I still think we are seeing distribution here. The only way this idea can be countered, is through a big increase of buying volume, if that doesn't happen, i think it's only a matter of time.

Comment:
					What a surprise, nothing has changed :) 

The price took a small dump but the volume was low so no real read on what the intent was. So we might see another move up, if we start to see a small pump that takes out the 7800, be aware of a fake breakout. The blue line is a possibility of what the move could look like IF we move up and if the breakout fails. If that happens than we will probably get confirmation if the price breaks the 7600ish. If we break the 7800 it should stay above the 7700 to confirm another move up. Not much more to say about what's going on.

Comment:
					So we have made a small drop, but there is no volume confirming it, not yet at least. First small support has been broken, but not yet very meaningful because of the low volume. For the ones who shorted it, just be aware of another squeeze up, since this small move downwards looks a bit to controlled.  

Pure TA, it broke the channel and retested the former support as resistance now.

937,1528359434.0,Taiwan_Bear,2618 (Double top & 0.618 pull-back) - do not miss it!!,"
In the last couple of TAs I have mentioned the “2618 pattern” and have been asked what 2618 means. Sorry for taking it so long as it took me quite a while to put everything altogether. But, as promised, I have explained below the rules and trade setups for the 2618 pattern.  

What are the rules/setups/steps for 2618?  
1.	Form a  double top  (Note #1)  
2.	Neckline has to be broken  
3.	After price found support at point (b), wait for pull back to 0.618 fib retracement of (a)(b)  
4.	After price retraced to 0.618, look for confluence and sell (eg. Structures,  trendlines  ,  double top  on a lower time frame,  rsi  divergence,  bearish pin bar  ,  inside bar  break down etc.) (Note #2)  
5.	Stop loss to be set above  double top 
6.	Set Take Profit levels (Note #3)  

Note #1 ( Double top ):  
The first step for the formation of 2618 is to form a  double top  at key resistance levels. Why at key resistance levels? Because we want to avoid fake double tops which can occur occasionally.  

There are some variations between various resources (books, websites) regarding the definitions of “double top”. The main differences occur where:  
a)	Some said for a  double top  to be valid, the wick of the 2nd top cannot exceed the wick of the 1st top; whereas, others said:  
b)	The wick of the 2nd top can exceed the wick of the 1st top but the candle close of the 2nd top CANNOT exceed the wick of the 1st top; or  
c)	The wick of the 2nd top can exceed the wick of the 1st top and the candle close of the 2nd top CAN exceed the wick of the 1st top; or  
d)	The wick of the 2nd top meets at least the candle close of the 1st top; or  
e)	The body of the 2nd top cannot exceed the body of the 1st top  

Personally, I would say all the above definitions work just fine although I do prefer definition a) because it means that the selling pressure is strong and the bulls fail to make a higher high. When there is a higher high formed in a downtrend, it can mean the downtrend has reversed and therefore you might not want to sell when the price pulls back to the 0.618 fib retracement.  

Note #2 ( 0.618 retracement ):  
When the price pulls back to 0.618, it does not mean to sell straight away. There must be more than one reason to sell other than the 0.618 retrace. The more reasons the better. In this example, you can see there are certainly structures (key resistance levels) at the 0.618 retrace. As well, there was a  double top  formed on the lower time frame. Consequently, you can sell.  

After  BTC              hit the 0.618 retrace the first time, the price dropped from $9735 to $8650. but quickly bounced back to the 0.618 retrace level. That was a second & better opportunity to sell. Not only did  BTC              form a  double top  on the larger time frame, but also with a  bearish  divergence on the 4hr time frame. Accordingly, you have more reasons to sell.  

Note #3 (Set take profit)  
Same as the rules of “Double top”, there are some variations as to which price level should you take profits. Personally, I would stick to the below:  
1)	First, take profit when risk/reward ratio hits 1:1 (recommend to take 30% - 50% profits and adjust the SL of the remaining positions to break-even)  
2)	When price hits the same price level as the low after the neckline is broken ((b) point in this example)  
3)	When price hits 1.272 fib extension of (a)(b)  
4)	When price hits point (d) (using  AB=CD  pattern. If you are not sure what the rules of  AB=CD  are, you can refer to my previous TA in which I have attached the link below)  
5)	If in a one-way market (heavily bearish/bullish), you can always keep 10% to 20% of your positions and take profits when risk/reward ratio hits 1:5 or even 1:10

 BTC -1.77%  is on the verge of breaking to a daily higher high on the bounce if the bulls can see a push this morning. 
If we reject from here the daily will form a lower high and we will see a tightening pattern within the highlighted  support and resistance  lines.  
Important for the bulls to show up or we could stay in this range into tomorrow.  
Healthy consolidation after the most recent bull move and the 15 min chart needs to change the trend.  
Also look to  EMA  12 support on the 4 hour and hourly.  
Another morning like yesterday with the bulls comfortable as worst case, we likely stay in the tightening pattern if bulls cannot prove themselves.

The current situation of  Bitcoin -1.77%  is quite difficult. We are on a clear treshold. A lot of traders are saying that we are on a clear downtrend, but the same amount of people are claiming that we will have our reversal soon. 

This article tries to sum up all important information you have to need! 

1: Retracement of a parabolic uptrend: 
There is a rule of thumb for the retracement of a parabolic uptrend. We should retrace to approx. the 0.786  Fibonacci Retracement  +/- 10%! 
Depending where we start the count, we are already in that target. Although both ways (blue and red) have still some space for a further downwave! 







2: The bloody support of Bitcoin: 
The average cost of mining one  bitcoin -1.77%  are at USA/Russia approx. 4700$ and at 3100$ for china! 
A drop below a target of 4700$ would be savage. Nevertheless, i can't image that we will hit that target. 







3: Manipulation of  Bitcoin -1.77%  and the Bart Simpson Pattern: 
A friend of mine found some unusual patterns in the orderbooks of several exchanges: 
https://twitter.com/CryptoSyndrome 
Altcoins are manipulated on a daily basis. It seems that  bitcoin -1.77%  is now affected to this too, which causes all these 3-5% pump and dumps. 
Thus, we are forming all the time the Bartin Simpsons Patterns. 

4: Similarity to 2014: 
Bitcoin -1.77%  now: 






Bitcoin -1.77%  2014: 







5: Deminishing downtrend and a strong support 
If we see the falling  wedges  as the force of the downtrend, then the force is diminishing! 
Furthermore we have strong support which is holding now for the 4th time! 







6: The Indicators 
Having a look at the indicators at 2D, we have a good potential for an upwave now. 
The  volume  is deminishing which should indicate a breakout soon. 
The  MACD  is about to cross, the  RSI  was slightly overbought and is heading up like the  Stoch .  RSI . 
The 200  EMA  is slighty under the current price and act as a support. 

7: The symetrical Triangle 
The theory says, that we should have in a  sym -0.80% . triangle 5 times an  ABC  wave. The waves are not perfect, but we can construct them. 






As you can see, the last four ABC-Waves formed always a 1:1 extention, which indicates that we have finished wave 5. 

8: A possible Head and Shoulders 
Even if this is not the most perfect  Head and Shoulders  Pattern, it's still valid! 
We are currently at the neckline, which is a strong and important resistance. Breaking upwards should indicate a good uptrend. 







9: The magic  6th 0.00%  of the month 






Suprisingly we have on every  6th 0.00%  of the month a reversal. Why is that??? 
One reason could be the  CME Group Futures  with dates for the settlements always nearby the  6th 0.00%  of the month! 
http://www.cmegroup.com 

10: Longterm  Bullish  TA 
The whole pattern could be seen as a big  bullish pennant . 







11: Shortterm  Bullish  TA 
Leading diagonal  starting wave1 of an  Elliott Wave , since we have now an impulse wave, after the 5x  ABC  pattern inside the triangle is finished. 
Our target should be at the top of the triangle nearby 8600-8800$. 







12: Longterm  Bearish  TA 
We also can argue, that we are currenty in an downtrend and the  sym -0.80% . triangle just continuing the trend. 
Our target should be nearby 6000$ which is also a finished downwards  Elliott Wave .

Nothing is happening in the market:  volatility  has become extinct and coins' trading fallen out of fashion. Range-bound bots and robotic humans absolutely prosper in this environment. The price was unable to break the 7700 threshold. For me this is a  bearish  signal. Indicators provide mixed signals, so let's examine wave structure. The move from May 29 is a  3-wave -0.12%  correction within a larger downtrend. A price drop below 7500 would confirm this scenario.

Comment:
					Impulse Wave Truncation (Truncated Fifth) - 
Truncated 5th wave is when the market has become so over-extended in Wave 3 that there is not much force left for the impulse wave to come to a proper completion. So when this happens, there is a chance that the last wave of the impulse, Wave 5, will not reach the end of Wave 3 before the market starts correcting in the opposite direction. At this point, the market is just too exhausted. This condition is often called a “failure” or a “Truncation.”

I can see many people still believe that we are going inside a  descending triangle . I also believed this in my idea that i shard on may 1st: 



 

Things can change so quickly and if we didn't adapt to the changes then someone will. That's why i believe that we have to be in fast adapt mode in this market. Doesn't mean that you need to change without checking yourself. I try to find 2-3 confirmations before i change my idea on something. This includes pattern changes, trend changes etc 

There are 21 corrective wave patterns in EW which is categorized into major 3 corrective wave patterns: 

Zigzag  (5-3-5) 
Flat (3-3-5) 
Triangle (3-3-3-3-3) 

And other patterns are combinations of the above which is:  

Double three (A combination of two corrective patterns above) 
Triple three (A combination of three corrective patterns above) 

So what i can see now is that we are in two double three combination corrective wave pattern: 








More info here:  

https://elliottwave-forecast.com/elliott-wave-theory/#corrective-waves 

Confirmations: 

1. Wave ((i)) of C is 1.6k and ((v)) is going to be completed below the triangle 
2. Wave (E) of the triangle can't go beyond the triangle.  
3. This has happened twice before in 2013 & 2015 

Each wave  got 3 subwaves (a,b &c) inside and we are in the subwave c of ((y)) of Y which is an impulsive wave. 

Impulsive waves: 1,3,5,a,c 
Corrective waves: 2,4,b 

Normal Fibo Ratios for these waves are: 

wave 2 = 0.5 - 0.8 of wave 1  
wave 3 = 1.236 - 1.618 of wave 1  
wave 4 = 0.5 - 0.618 of wave 3  
wave 5 = 0.618 - 1 of wave 1  
wave B = 0.5 - 0.8 of wave A  
wave C = 0.618 - 1.236 of wave A  

Now if you check what happened in subwave a of ((y)) of Y you can see that: 

Wave (i) of a: 985$ 
Wave (ii) of a: 434$  
Wave ( iii             ) of a: 1207$  
Wave (iv) of a: 691$ [~0.618 of Wave ( iii             )] 
Wave (v) of a: 950$  








I have seen  BTC              impulsive waves fibo ratios almost the same as the previous impulsive wave fibo ratios. 
Now if you apply the same for the last wave C of (E) this is what you get: 

Wave ((i)) of c: 1587$ 
Wave ((ii)) of c  = 793$ 
Wave (( iii             )) of c  = 1961$ 
Wave ((iv)) of c [~0.618 of Wave (( iii             ))] = 1212$ 
Wave ((v)) of c  = 1587$ 








Also note that Wave ((iv)) might not retrace upto 0.618 of Wave (( iii             )) as everyone will be in panic mode by that time so minimum retracement would be around 0.386 of Wave (( iii             )) which is around 756$ and this is why i can see it goes down to 5k level or little bit more towards 4.7k which is the lowest level of the  support zone  (orange dotted lines) 








So 3 Possible Support lines for reversal would be 

1. Blue: 5800 - 6100 (Only possible if Wave ((v)) is truncated) 
2. Orange: 4700 - 5000 (This is most likely where we heading)  
3. Red: 4100 - 4400 (Only possible if Wave (( iii             )) is extended)

 Bitcoin -1.77%  has recently developed an interesting pattern of completing a  bullish  and  bearish  cycle on the sixth of every month in an alternating order. As we can see in the chart above, a fall is followed by a rise. This has happened twice before and is expected to happen again now on the  6th 0.00%  of June, 2018. This time  Bitcoin -1.77%  will finish a  bearish  cycle and I expected to begin the next  bullish  cycle at least till the end of  6th 0.00%  of July, 2018. 

This pattern of rise and fall is also supported by other patterns on the chart that signal a  bullish  reversal. The support line has also held firmly and if this pattern of alternating rise and fall ensues,  Bitcoin -1.77%  could very well make new highs by the end of the year. The  RSI  is recovering from oversold levels and has now approached a normal.  Bitcoin -1.77%  is currently at a favorable point for  bullish  entries. The price broke a long term resistance as it break past the downtrend line in April, 2018. This was a big accomplishment for the bulls but the lack of confidence pulled the price back to the support line. Currently, the price is just above the support line and appears to be all set for a  bullish  comeback but the reality is, there are not enough bulls in the market. 

The past few months have been devastating for the price of  Bitcoin -1.77%  ( BTC -1.77% ) and a lot of investors are still running scared. Institutional investors are looking for more clarity regarding regulations concerning cryptocurrencies and also safer ways to invest and store their coins. As for retail investors, most of them comprise of first time investors who have never traded any financial asset before. So, when they saw that  Bitcoin -1.77%  ( BTC -1.77% ) is making 20% gains every day, they thought this could go on forever and jumped with both feet, only to find the carpet pulled under from their feet. Big investors have always played small investors as cannon fodder and have gotten away with their schemes even in regulated markets like forex or the stock market. Cryptocurrencies is a new market with no proper regulations which means it is natural to expect that those who can afford to not play by the rules, most likely won’t.

Hello friends,  

It's been a while since my last post; lack of time and an urge to do more research has mainly driven me to take a break from posting ideas on TradingView. I am still in the process of doing more research and study, but I figure posting once in a while couldn't hurt. 

Since I have become recently very convinced about this, I am outlining a very possible situation with  Bitcoin              where the  trend line  we have been on since early October breaks, reaching around a temporary low of $5000. This is examined on the  daily chart , since this is one of the best charts to examine trends of this size. I have to first and foremost say that I am not trying to spread fear, I know many people do not like to hear  bearish  ideas, but  technical analysis  is ultimately a rational exercise, and I feel that possibilities with very strong signs should be explored. 

There are a few things to look at, but I first want to talk about the big picture with, long-term  support and resistance  lines. I think most people can agree that there was a very significant downtrending resistance line that began from the peak of the  ATH              in late December, to the low of around $6400 (thick red line). After the break from that line, it seems we moved into a sideways trend, bouncing back and forth between an emerging downtrending resistance line (light red) and a support line that we seem to have been respecting since mid-October (light green); at least this appears to be the case with the lows, where the angle's effectiveness appears very strongly. Finally, based on previous bounces, we can establish a support of around $5000-$5300 (I've thus created a small  support zone  around that range, in dark green), as well as lower supports around $3200 and $2000 (though I do not believe these will be reached, in dark green).   

Now, onto the analysis - it's no secret that  Bitcoin              has been squeezing in, ready for a significant move either upwards or downwards. Initially I considered the upwards move to be more likely due to the significant media attention cryptocurrency has been receiving, but after viewing previous market cycles of  Bitcoin              (check 2013), it seems clear to me that the  bearish  scenario of closing in on the market cycle is very likely, and should at the very least be prepared for with proper risk management. According to Dow Theory, which is said to have laid the foundations of modern  technical analysis , history repeats itself, and this is a situation where we forced to consider this. 

Should we break from the line, we will likely fall straight down to the $5000-$5000 area, where we will shoot back up and bounce towards around $6700 or so (maybe a little less). From there one, we will likely enter a sideways trend, which we will continue until we see higher highs and higher lows and parabolic movement returns, which could lead to us challenging the all-time high, and hitting $35k-$50k. 

NOTE: I seem to have reached the max character limit for this section of the idea, so I will continue my text below.

Comment:
					Onto the short-term: 


Scenario A: 

The reason why I have drawn this movement into a pennant is this way, is simply because we have been moving through this ascending triangle for quite a while now (May 23rd to today). I don't think that the pattern will be sufficient to directly lead into a strong sell-off, but we should consider that the size of ascending triangle suggests a small movement downwards at the very least, which can create a higher low, and thus move into position into a bearish pennant. Why would a bearish pennant occur here and not have a bounce to $8500-$8700? The reason is in positioning - the huge downtrend (May 5th to May 26th) creates a very nice flagpole in which it hits around the $5000 area very perfectly, and thus I would not be surprised if this happens. 

Second reason: on the Stoch RSI indicator on the daily chart, it appears to be dangerously high, which would suggest it being oversold. For the most part, it seems to have called lows and highs, at least to some extent. This overdrawn movement may very well have increased the likelyhood of Bitcoin being oversold. This could suggest that this is the last step into a sharp downturn, but this does not preclude Situation B. Volume has also been steadily decreasing, but this is the case with any sort of consolidation, I believe. 

Finally, the lines I have drawn below the triangle are simply bounces that I think seem fairly reasonable. The length from to support to the lines correlate with the length of the flagpole, of course, though it may seem chopped off due to the huge line from the long-term support downwards. 


Scenario B: 

This is much simpler, Bitcoin hits the upper resistance line, bounces off, challenges the lower support line, and we potentially see a break, and the rest unfolds from there. 


----------------------------------------------------------------------- 


With all this being said, do not fear if you are hoping for more parabolic movement - this likely will not be the end, and will simply be the set up for a long, drawn out sideways movement until the first signs of bullish activity begin and we start all over again. If you are longing around here, please consider using risk management, prepare for every possibility. If you are shorting, the same applies. 

Please trade with care. I wish the best to all traders!

Comment:
					This really is a very minor note, but I just want to emphasize that the rising wedge (which I erroneously refer to as an ascending triangle, a bad habit I have) entering a bearish pennant is more based on intuition than anything. Also, this pennant is mainly based on the conservative assumption that the break will happen at 7900, if it happens at 7700 where we seem to be general resistance, the pennant would look something like this:

I am Mid term-bullish on  BTC -1.77%  going into the end of this week, but looking to get into the market on a pull back to occur before I get in to the market.  The jury is still out as to whether this weekly bear trend is ready to turn around.  

We can see that both the  RSI  and  MFI  are both  Bullish  on the daily having bottomed when reaching oversold on both at c. $7k support where we found our longer term  trend line . 

We are currently in the process of meeting the Tenkan (blue line) as I write this, so in the very short term, I am looking for a pull back to $7550 range for an entry.  One of the main reasons for this is that on the 4hour timeframes we are close to completing an edge to edge trade so the risk reward doesn’t fit my profile, however a break out from the cloud or above the Tenkan around $7777 will make me enter the market. 

The  RSI  and  MFI  have both been excellent indicators in this bear market.  Whenever  RSI  has gone above the 60 and the  MFI  80; its time to exit the market from a  bullish  trade and consider shorting as it progresses higher.   

Based on the  RSI ,  MFI  trends and the fact that we will run into the Kijun at just around $8-8.2k, I will be scalling out at this  bearish  confluence level to start looking for pull backs and reassessment as i believe it to be a key point as  

Best case scenario this trade would yield a 10% return before leverage. 
This is for illustrative purposes only, please DYOR and goodluck with your trading.

So the pullback trade that we were looking at worked out & has made it's way back to the neckline level of structure. We are now at what i like to call a ""decision point"" Essentially IF price is able to violate this current level od structure THEN we're likely to continue to our next price projection.  

Something that a lot of newer traders don't understand is that when it comes to bigger moves, the market will often provide multiple opportunities to get involved. For those who don't rush and for those who don't get discouraged. If you perform consistent analysis you can often find multiple ways to involve yourself in a trade even if you missed the first strike.

Here is a chart that we can understand the future price action and where to buy back. Before you guys start blasting my comment section with the time and how it may not be right thats correct. I am not calculating the time I'm just making a technical drawing of the directions that we will see in the next few months.  

Recent price action has clear signs of wash trading / market manipulation fud and lots of nonsense. Its hard to prove almost impossible so as a trader we just need to deal with it. Ideally the situation you are supposed to trade are critical break up and break down points to enter the trade. Dont enter or exit dumb trades and lose money. As an experienced trader you should be looking for shorts, I would not consider a long unless we are over $10-12k

I am never good with words so instead of writing paragraphs of clarification to justify my call for SHORT since my last posting, I have explained everything on my chart with the least words possible using Fibonacci. It does not matter how popular  Bitcoin              has become, or how deep it has disrupted the financial sector, or how many institutional investors have come to invest in it -- the psychology behind a market cycle does not change. 

I don't really encourage anyone to short  Bitcoin             , but in all honesty, don't expect the bulls to fly anytime soon. Like I said before, this correction that we are having right now is the ""MOTHER OF ALL CORRECTIONS"" after a 4-year-long bull cycle since the 2013 correction... and we are just halfway through.

My best idea ever, taking some time off the last 2 days :) The whales just continue to play their little games by squeezing leveraged short and long positions out of the market. Can't play them, it's just too easy. Maybe it's time we retail traders stand together, combine our  volume  and use their own game against them. Yeah, maybe we could even make a blockbuster movie about this :) I love me some science fiction :) LOL  

My last update of the previous analysis i showed 2 important support levels where the price could bounce up from. The first support around 7350 did the trick and the price got pushed back to 7700. From that point on i told my members that i thought i was seeing distribution, but it was still very confusing to figure out what was going on. TA was showing  bullish  signs, that  bull flag  was very strong and was even turning slowly up and was about to squeeze upwards. But of course out of no where the price got dumped, the move we saw a few hours ago. After that 200 point drop the price got pushed up again to 7700 like that dump was a glitch. If your a whale, why not push out leveraged traders and take your money while your accumulating or distributing. It's like a bonus, like the cherry on top :)  

Anyway, in this chart we can see allot of similarities of what is going on. As you know i have been saying i am still  bearish  for the medium term, but i just could not say what was going to happen on the short term. 2 days ago after we finally dropped out of that  wedge , i said we would have 2 options.  
- Break those 2 support levels from the last update of my previous chart (73xx and 71xx) 
- Make a higher low at those same support levels and make another move up above the high.  
 
As we can see in the chart, the  fractal  is not 100% identical so it's no guarantee that the 7700 high we just saw is the high already and that we start to move down. But based on this  fractal , i don't want to see the price get above the 7800/7900. This  fractal  confirms my  bearish  view as well. That's why TA is so great, you can turn any chart to fit your view :). 

Even without this  fractal , i just give it a very small chance that 7K price action is the fundament of a low to start another bull rally, i just highly doubt that. I want to see more  volume  to begin with and at least  double bottom  kind of formation. So the minimum i expect is a test of the 7100/6900in the coming week or 2. But the movement i have in mind for the med term is a drop below the 7K to form a big V shape low. If we get to see that, than i might even become  bullish  for the rest of the year :).  

As long as the price stays above the 73xx, we have to assume the bulls are still in control and we should see another wave up. So for me the 73xx is an important turning point.

					This is my bigger picture, think this bearish triangle is still 100% in play. I think if bulls can't break the 7800/7900 the bearish version is probably going to happen. Can't say HOW it will go, this blue line is just a guess. But a big V shape low would be the most bullish for the long term. I still think we are seeing distribution here. The only way this idea can be countered, is through a big increase of buying volume, if that doesn't happen, i think it's only a matter of time.

					What a surprise, nothing has changed :) 

The price took a small dump but the volume was low so no real read on what the intent was. So we might see another move up, if we start to see a small pump that takes out the 7800, be aware of a fake breakout. The blue line is a possibility of what the move could look like IF we move up and if the breakout fails. If that happens than we will probably get confirmation if the price breaks the 7600ish. If we break the 7800 it should stay above the 7700 to confirm another move up. Not much more to say about what's going on.

					So we have made a small drop, but there is no volume confirming it, not yet at least. First small support has been broken, but not yet very meaningful because of the low volume. For the ones who shorted it, just be aware of another squeeze up, since this small move downwards looks a bit to controlled.  

Pure TA, it broke the channel and retested the former support as resistance now.

955,1528359434.0,Taiwan_Bear,2618 (Double top & 0.618 pull-back) - do not miss it!!,"
In the last couple of TAs I have mentioned the “2618 pattern” and have been asked what 2618 means. Sorry for taking it so long as it took me quite a while to put everything altogether. But, as promised, I have explained below the rules and trade setups for the 2618 pattern.  

What are the rules/setups/steps for 2618?  
1.	Form a  double top  (Note #1)  
2.	Neckline has to be broken  
3.	After price found support at point (b), wait for pull back to 0.618 fib retracement of (a)(b)  
4.	After price retraced to 0.618, look for confluence and sell (eg. Structures,  trendlines  ,  double top  on a lower time frame,  rsi  divergence,  bearish pin bar  ,  inside bar  break down etc.) (Note #2)  
5.	Stop loss to be set above  double top 
6.	Set Take Profit levels (Note #3)  

Note #1 ( Double top ):  
The first step for the formation of 2618 is to form a  double top  at key resistance levels. Why at key resistance levels? Because we want to avoid fake double tops which can occur occasionally.  

There are some variations between various resources (books, websites) regarding the definitions of “double top”. The main differences occur where:  
a)	Some said for a  double top  to be valid, the wick of the 2nd top cannot exceed the wick of the 1st top; whereas, others said:  
b)	The wick of the 2nd top can exceed the wick of the 1st top but the candle close of the 2nd top CANNOT exceed the wick of the 1st top; or  
c)	The wick of the 2nd top can exceed the wick of the 1st top and the candle close of the 2nd top CAN exceed the wick of the 1st top; or  
d)	The wick of the 2nd top meets at least the candle close of the 1st top; or  
e)	The body of the 2nd top cannot exceed the body of the 1st top  

Personally, I would say all the above definitions work just fine although I do prefer definition a) because it means that the selling pressure is strong and the bulls fail to make a higher high. When there is a higher high formed in a downtrend, it can mean the downtrend has reversed and therefore you might not want to sell when the price pulls back to the 0.618 fib retracement.  

Note #2 ( 0.618 retracement ):  
When the price pulls back to 0.618, it does not mean to sell straight away. There must be more than one reason to sell other than the 0.618 retrace. The more reasons the better. In this example, you can see there are certainly structures (key resistance levels) at the 0.618 retrace. As well, there was a  double top  formed on the lower time frame. Consequently, you can sell.  

After  BTC              hit the 0.618 retrace the first time, the price dropped from $9735 to $8650. but quickly bounced back to the 0.618 retrace level. That was a second & better opportunity to sell. Not only did  BTC              form a  double top  on the larger time frame, but also with a  bearish  divergence on the 4hr time frame. Accordingly, you have more reasons to sell.  

Note #3 (Set take profit)  
Same as the rules of “Double top”, there are some variations as to which price level should you take profits. Personally, I would stick to the below:  
1)	First, take profit when risk/reward ratio hits 1:1 (recommend to take 30% - 50% profits and adjust the SL of the remaining positions to break-even)  
2)	When price hits the same price level as the low after the neckline is broken ((b) point in this example)  
3)	When price hits 1.272 fib extension of (a)(b)  
4)	When price hits point (d) (using  AB=CD  pattern. If you are not sure what the rules of  AB=CD  are, you can refer to my previous TA in which I have attached the link below)  
5)	If in a one-way market (heavily bearish/bullish), you can always keep 10% to 20% of your positions and take profits when risk/reward ratio hits 1:5 or even 1:10

 BTC -1.77%  is on the verge of breaking to a daily higher high on the bounce if the bulls can see a push this morning. 
If we reject from here the daily will form a lower high and we will see a tightening pattern within the highlighted  support and resistance  lines.  
Important for the bulls to show up or we could stay in this range into tomorrow.  
Healthy consolidation after the most recent bull move and the 15 min chart needs to change the trend.  
Also look to  EMA  12 support on the 4 hour and hourly.  
Another morning like yesterday with the bulls comfortable as worst case, we likely stay in the tightening pattern if bulls cannot prove themselves.

The current situation of  Bitcoin -1.77%  is quite difficult. We are on a clear treshold. A lot of traders are saying that we are on a clear downtrend, but the same amount of people are claiming that we will have our reversal soon. 

This article tries to sum up all important information you have to need! 

1: Retracement of a parabolic uptrend: 
There is a rule of thumb for the retracement of a parabolic uptrend. We should retrace to approx. the 0.786  Fibonacci Retracement  +/- 10%! 
Depending where we start the count, we are already in that target. Although both ways (blue and red) have still some space for a further downwave! 







2: The bloody support of Bitcoin: 
The average cost of mining one  bitcoin -1.77%  are at USA/Russia approx. 4700$ and at 3100$ for china! 
A drop below a target of 4700$ would be savage. Nevertheless, i can't image that we will hit that target.

Altcoins are manipulated on a daily basis. It seems that  bitcoin -1.77%  is now affected to this too, which causes all these 3-5% pump and dumps. 
Thus, we are forming all the time the Bartin Simpsons Patterns.

Bitcoin -1.77%  2014: 







5: Deminishing downtrend and a strong support 
If we see the falling  wedges  as the force of the downtrend, then the force is diminishing! 
Furthermore we have strong support which is holding now for the 4th time! 







6: The Indicators 
Having a look at the indicators at 2D, we have a good potential for an upwave now. 
The  volume  is deminishing which should indicate a breakout soon. 
The  MACD  is about to cross, the  RSI  was slightly overbought and is heading up like the  Stoch .  RSI . 
The 200  EMA  is slighty under the current price and act as a support. 

7: The symetrical Triangle 
The theory says, that we should have in a  sym -0.80% . triangle 5 times an  ABC  wave. The waves are not perfect, but we can construct them. 






As you can see, the last four ABC-Waves formed always a 1:1 extention, which indicates that we have finished wave 5. 

8: A possible Head and Shoulders 
Even if this is not the most perfect  Head and Shoulders  Pattern, it's still valid! 
We are currently at the neckline, which is a strong and important resistance. Breaking upwards should indicate a good uptrend. 







9: The magic  6th 0.00%  of the month 






Suprisingly we have on every  6th 0.00%  of the month a reversal. Why is that??? 
One reason could be the  CME Group Futures  with dates for the settlements always nearby the  6th 0.00%  of the month! 
http://www.cmegroup.com 

10: Longterm  Bullish  TA 
The whole pattern could be seen as a big  bullish pennant . 







11: Shortterm  Bullish  TA 
Leading diagonal  starting wave1 of an  Elliott Wave , since we have now an impulse wave, after the 5x  ABC  pattern inside the triangle is finished. 
Our target should be at the top of the triangle nearby 8600-8800$. 







12: Longterm  Bearish  TA 
We also can argue, that we are currenty in an downtrend and the  sym -0.80% . triangle just continuing the trend. 
Our target should be nearby 6000$ which is also a finished downwards  Elliott Wave .

Nothing is happening in the market:  volatility  has become extinct and coins' trading fallen out of fashion. Range-bound bots and robotic humans absolutely prosper in this environment. The price was unable to break the 7700 threshold. For me this is a  bearish  signal. Indicators provide mixed signals, so let's examine wave structure. The move from May 29 is a  3-wave -0.12%  correction within a larger downtrend. A price drop below 7500 would confirm this scenario.

					Impulse Wave Truncation (Truncated Fifth) - 
Truncated 5th wave is when the market has become so over-extended in Wave 3 that there is not much force left for the impulse wave to come to a proper completion. So when this happens, there is a chance that the last wave of the impulse, Wave 5, will not reach the end of Wave 3 before the market starts correcting in the opposite direction. At this point, the market is just too exhausted. This condition is often called a “failure” or a “Truncation.”

I can see many people still believe that we are going inside a  descending triangle . I also believed this in my idea that i shard on may 1st: 



 

Things can change so quickly and if we didn't adapt to the changes then someone will. That's why i believe that we have to be in fast adapt mode in this market. Doesn't mean that you need to change without checking yourself. I try to find 2-3 confirmations before i change my idea on something. This includes pattern changes, trend changes etc 

There are 21 corrective wave patterns in EW which is categorized into major 3 corrective wave patterns: 

Zigzag  (5-3-5) 
Flat (3-3-5) 
Triangle (3-3-3-3-3) 

And other patterns are combinations of the above which is:  

Double three (A combination of two corrective patterns above) 
Triple three (A combination of three corrective patterns above) 

So what i can see now is that we are in two double three combination corrective wave pattern: 








More info here:  

https://elliottwave-forecast.com/elliott-wave-theory/#corrective-waves 

Confirmations: 

1. Wave ((i)) of C is 1.6k and ((v)) is going to be completed below the triangle 
2. Wave (E) of the triangle can't go beyond the triangle.  
3. This has happened twice before in 2013 & 2015 

Each wave  got 3 subwaves (a,b &c) inside and we are in the subwave c of ((y)) of Y which is an impulsive wave. 

Impulsive waves: 1,3,5,a,c 
Corrective waves: 2,4,b 

Normal Fibo Ratios for these waves are: 

wave 2 = 0.5 - 0.8 of wave 1  
wave 3 = 1.236 - 1.618 of wave 1  
wave 4 = 0.5 - 0.618 of wave 3  
wave 5 = 0.618 - 1 of wave 1  
wave B = 0.5 - 0.8 of wave A  
wave C = 0.618 - 1.236 of wave A  

Now if you check what happened in subwave a of ((y)) of Y you can see that: 

Wave (i) of a: 985$ 
Wave (ii) of a: 434$  
Wave ( iii             ) of a: 1207$  
Wave (iv) of a: 691$ [~0.618 of Wave ( iii             )] 
Wave (v) of a: 950$  








I have seen  BTC              impulsive waves fibo ratios almost the same as the previous impulsive wave fibo ratios. 
Now if you apply the same for the last wave C of (E) this is what you get: 

Wave ((i)) of c: 1587$ 
Wave ((ii)) of c  = 793$ 
Wave (( iii             )) of c  = 1961$ 
Wave ((iv)) of c [~0.618 of Wave (( iii             ))] = 1212$ 
Wave ((v)) of c  = 1587$ 








Also note that Wave ((iv)) might not retrace upto 0.618 of Wave (( iii             )) as everyone will be in panic mode by that time so minimum retracement would be around 0.386 of Wave (( iii             )) which is around 756$ and this is why i can see it goes down to 5k level or little bit more towards 4.7k which is the lowest level of the  support zone  (orange dotted lines) 








So 3 Possible Support lines for reversal would be 

1. Blue: 5800 - 6100 (Only possible if Wave ((v)) is truncated) 
2. Orange: 4700 - 5000 (This is most likely where we heading)  
3. Red: 4100 - 4400 (Only possible if Wave (( iii             )) is extended)

 Bitcoin -1.77%  has recently developed an interesting pattern of completing a  bullish  and  bearish  cycle on the sixth of every month in an alternating order. As we can see in the chart above, a fall is followed by a rise. This has happened twice before and is expected to happen again now on the  6th 0.00%  of June, 2018. This time  Bitcoin -1.77%  will finish a  bearish  cycle and I expected to begin the next  bullish  cycle at least till the end of  6th 0.00%  of July, 2018. 

This pattern of rise and fall is also supported by other patterns on the chart that signal a  bullish  reversal. The support line has also held firmly and if this pattern of alternating rise and fall ensues,  Bitcoin -1.77%  could very well make new highs by the end of the year. The  RSI  is recovering from oversold levels and has now approached a normal.  Bitcoin -1.77%  is currently at a favorable point for  bullish  entries. The price broke a long term resistance as it break past the downtrend line in April, 2018. This was a big accomplishment for the bulls but the lack of confidence pulled the price back to the support line. Currently, the price is just above the support line and appears to be all set for a  bullish  comeback but the reality is, there are not enough bulls in the market. 

The past few months have been devastating for the price of  Bitcoin -1.77%  ( BTC -1.77% ) and a lot of investors are still running scared. Institutional investors are looking for more clarity regarding regulations concerning cryptocurrencies and also safer ways to invest and store their coins. As for retail investors, most of them comprise of first time investors who have never traded any financial asset before. So, when they saw that  Bitcoin -1.77%  ( BTC -1.77% ) is making 20% gains every day, they thought this could go on forever and jumped with both feet, only to find the carpet pulled under from their feet. Big investors have always played small investors as cannon fodder and have gotten away with their schemes even in regulated markets like forex or the stock market. Cryptocurrencies is a new market with no proper regulations which means it is natural to expect that those who can afford to not play by the rules, most likely won’t.

Hello friends,  

It's been a while since my last post; lack of time and an urge to do more research has mainly driven me to take a break from posting ideas on TradingView. I am still in the process of doing more research and study, but I figure posting once in a while couldn't hurt. 

Since I have become recently very convinced about this, I am outlining a very possible situation with  Bitcoin -1.77%  where the  trend line  we have been on since early October breaks, reaching around a temporary low of $5000. This is examined on the  daily chart , since this is one of the best charts to examine trends of this size. I have to first and foremost say that I am not trying to spread fear, I know many people do not like to hear  bearish  ideas, but  technical analysis  is ultimately a rational exercise, and I feel that possibilities with very strong signs should be explored. 

There are a few things to look at, but I first want to talk about the big picture with, long-term  support and resistance  lines. I think most people can agree that there was a very significant downtrending resistance line that began from the peak of the  ATH 0.63%  in late December, to the low of around $6400 (thick red line). After the break from that line, it seems we moved into a sideways trend, bouncing back and forth between an emerging downtrending resistance line (light red) and a support line that we seem to have been respecting since mid-October (light green); at least this appears to be the case with the lows, where the angle's effectiveness appears very strongly. Finally, based on previous bounces, we can establish a support of around $5000-$5300 (I've thus created a small  support zone  around that range, in dark green), as well as lower supports around $3200 and $2000 (though I do not believe these will be reached, in dark green).   

Now, onto the analysis - it's no secret that  Bitcoin -1.77%  has been squeezing in, ready for a significant move either upwards or downwards. Initially I considered the upwards move to be more likely due to the significant media attention cryptocurrency has been receiving, but after viewing previous market cycles of  Bitcoin -1.77%  (check 2013), it seems clear to me that the  bearish  scenario of closing in on the market cycle is very likely, and should at the very least be prepared for with proper risk management. According to Dow Theory, which is said to have laid the foundations of modern  technical analysis , history repeats itself, and this is a situation where we forced to consider this. 

Should we break from the line, we will likely fall straight down to the $5000-$5000 area, where we will shoot back up and bounce towards around $6700 or so (maybe a little less). From there one, we will likely enter a sideways trend, which we will continue until we see higher highs and higher lows and parabolic movement returns, which could lead to us challenging the all-time high, and hitting $35k-$50k. 

NOTE: I seem to have reached the max character limit for this section of the idea, so I will continue my text below.

Comment:
					Onto the short-term: 


Scenario A: 

The reason why I have drawn this movement into a pennant is this way, is simply because we have been moving through this ascending triangle for quite a while now (May 23rd to today). I don't think that the pattern will be sufficient to directly lead into a strong sell-off, but we should consider that the size of ascending triangle suggests a small movement downwards at the very least, which can create a higher low, and thus move into position into a bearish pennant. Why would a bearish pennant occur here and not have a bounce to $8500-$8700? The reason is in positioning - the huge downtrend (May 5th to May 26th) creates a very nice flagpole in which it hits around the $5000 area very perfectly, and thus I would not be surprised if this happens. 

Second reason: on the Stoch RSI indicator on the daily chart, it appears to be dangerously high, which would suggest it being oversold. For the most part, it seems to have called lows and highs, at least to some extent. This overdrawn movement may very well have increased the likelyhood of Bitcoin being oversold. This could suggest that this is the last step into a sharp downturn, but this does not preclude Situation B. Volume has also been steadily decreasing, but this is the case with any sort of consolidation, I believe. 

Finally, the lines I have drawn below the triangle are simply bounces that I think seem fairly reasonable. The length from to support to the lines correlate with the length of the flagpole, of course, though it may seem chopped off due to the huge line from the long-term support downwards. 


Scenario B: 

This is much simpler, Bitcoin hits the upper resistance line, bounces off, challenges the lower support line, and we potentially see a break, and the rest unfolds from there. 


----------------------------------------------------------------------- 


With all this being said, do not fear if you are hoping for more parabolic movement - this likely will not be the end, and will simply be the set up for a long, drawn out sideways movement until the first signs of bullish activity begin and we start all over again. If you are longing around here, please consider using risk management, prepare for every possibility. If you are shorting, the same applies. 

Please trade with care. I wish the best to all traders!

Comment:
					This really is a very minor note, but I just want to emphasize that the rising wedge (which I erroneously refer to as an ascending triangle, a bad habit I have) entering a bearish pennant is more based on intuition than anything. Also, this pennant is mainly based on the conservative assumption that the break will happen at 7900, if it happens at 7700 where we seem to be general resistance, the pennant would look something like this:

Jun 7




I am Mid term-bullish on  BTC -1.77%  going into the end of this week, but looking to get into the market on a pull back to occur before I get in to the market.  The jury is still out as to whether this weekly bear trend is ready to turn around.  

We can see that both the  RSI  and  MFI  are both  Bullish  on the daily having bottomed when reaching oversold on both at c. $7k support where we found our longer term  trend line . 

We are currently in the process of meeting the Tenkan (blue line) as I write this, so in the very short term, I am looking for a pull back to $7550 range for an entry.  One of the main reasons for this is that on the 4hour timeframes we are close to completing an edge to edge trade so the risk reward doesn’t fit my profile, however a break out from the cloud or above the Tenkan around $7777 will make me enter the market. 

The  RSI  and  MFI  have both been excellent indicators in this bear market.  Whenever  RSI  has gone above the 60 and the  MFI  80; its time to exit the market from a  bullish  trade and consider shorting as it progresses higher.   

Based on the  RSI ,  MFI  trends and the fact that we will run into the Kijun at just around $8-8.2k, I will be scalling out at this  bearish  confluence level to start looking for pull backs and reassessment as i believe it to be a key point as  

Best case scenario this trade would yield a 10% return before leverage. 
This is for illustrative purposes only, please DYOR and goodluck with your trading.

So the pullback trade that we were looking at worked out & has made it's way back to the neckline level of structure. We are now at what i like to call a ""decision point"" Essentially IF price is able to violate this current level od structure THEN we're likely to continue to our next price projection.  

Something that a lot of newer traders don't understand is that when it comes to bigger moves, the market will often provide multiple opportunities to get involved. For those who don't rush and for those who don't get discouraged. If you perform consistent analysis you can often find multiple ways to involve yourself in a trade even if you missed the first strike.

Recent price action has clear signs of wash trading / market manipulation fud and lots of nonsense. Its hard to prove almost impossible so as a trader we just need to deal with it.

My best idea ever, taking some time off the last 2 days :) The whales just continue to play their little games by squeezing leveraged short and long positions out of the market. Can't play them, it's just too easy. Maybe it's time we retail traders stand together, combine our  volume  and use their own game against them. Yeah, maybe we could even make a blockbuster movie about this :) I love me some science fiction :) LOL  

My last update of the previous analysis i showed 2 important support levels where the price could bounce up from. The first support around 7350 did the trick and the price got pushed back to 7700. From that point on i told my members that i thought i was seeing distribution, but it was still very confusing to figure out what was going on. TA was showing  bullish  signs, that  bull flag  was very strong and was even turning slowly up and was about to squeeze upwards. But of course out of no where the price got dumped, the move we saw a few hours ago. After that 200 point drop the price got pushed up again to 7700 like that dump was a glitch. If your a whale, why not push out leveraged traders and take your money while your accumulating or distributing. It's like a bonus, like the cherry on top :)  

Anyway, in this chart we can see allot of similarities of what is going on. As you know i have been saying i am still  bearish  for the medium term, but i just could not say what was going to happen on the short term. 2 days ago after we finally dropped out of that  wedge , i said we would have 2 options.  
- Break those 2 support levels from the last update of my previous chart (73xx and 71xx) 
- Make a higher low at those same support levels and make another move up above the high.  
 
As we can see in the chart, the  fractal  is not 100% identical so it's no guarantee that the 7700 high we just saw is the high already and that we start to move down. But based on this  fractal , i don't want to see the price get above the 7800/7900. This  fractal  confirms my  bearish  view as well. That's why TA is so great, you can turn any chart to fit your view :). 

Even without this  fractal , i just give it a very small chance that 7K price action is the fundament of a low to start another bull rally, i just highly doubt that. I want to see more  volume  to begin with and at least  double bottom  kind of formation. So the minimum i expect is a test of the 7100/6900in the coming week or 2. But the movement i have in mind for the med term is a drop below the 7K to form a big V shape low. If we get to see that, than i might even become  bullish  for the rest of the year :).  

As long as the price stays above the 73xx, we have to assume the bulls are still in control and we should see another wave up. So for me the 73xx is an important turning point.

					At the moment it looks like bulls are trying to push higher, this bull flag/triangle is still very strong. So no sign of weakness yet! First small sign would be a drop below 7620/7600. Bulls need to break 7700

Comment:
					This is my bigger picture, think this bearish triangle is still 100% in play. I think if bulls can't break the 7800/7900 the bearish version is probably going to happen. Can't say HOW it will go, this blue line is just a guess. But a big V shape low would be the most bullish for the long term. I still think we are seeing distribution here. The only way this idea can be countered, is through a big increase of buying volume, if that doesn't happen, i think it's only a matter of time.

					Lower time frame we can see a new upwards channel and maybe even a rising wedge. From the looks of it, it's slowly going down to test the support line again. Depending on what will happen there we can make a better prediction for the rest of the day.

					What a surprise, nothing has changed :) 

The price took a small dump but the volume was low so no real read on what the intent was. So we might see another move up, if we start to see a small pump that takes out the 7800, be aware of a fake breakout. The blue line is a possibility of what the move could look like IF we move up and if the breakout fails. If that happens than we will probably get confirmation if the price breaks the 7600ish. If we break the 7800 it should stay above the 7700 to confirm another move up. Not much more to say about what's going on.

Comment:
					So we have made a small drop, but there is no volume confirming it, not yet at least. First small support has been broken, but not yet very meaningful because of the low volume. For the ones who shorted it, just be aware of another squeeze up, since this small move downwards looks a bit to controlled.  

Pure TA, it broke the channel and retested the former support as resistance now.

Jun 7




In the last couple of TAs I have mentioned the “2618 pattern” and have been asked what 2618 means. Sorry for taking it so long as it took me quite a while to put everything altogether. But, as promised, I have explained below the rules and trade setups for the 2618 pattern.  

What are the rules/setups/steps for 2618?  
1.	Form a  double top  (Note #1)  
2.	Neckline has to be broken  
3.	After price found support at point (b), wait for pull back to 0.618 fib retracement of (a)(b)  
4.	After price retraced to 0.618, look for confluence and sell (eg. Structures,  trendlines  ,  double top  on a lower time frame,  rsi  divergence,  bearish pin bar  ,  inside bar  break down etc.) (Note #2)  
5.	Stop loss to be set above  double top 
6.	Set Take Profit levels (Note #3)  

Note #1 ( Double top ):  
The first step for the formation of 2618 is to form a  double top  at key resistance levels. Why at key resistance levels? Because we want to avoid fake double tops which can occur occasionally.  

There are some variations between various resources (books, websites) regarding the definitions of “double top”. The main differences occur where:  
a)	Some said for a  double top  to be valid, the wick of the 2nd top cannot exceed the wick of the 1st top; whereas, others said:  
b)	The wick of the 2nd top can exceed the wick of the 1st top but the candle close of the 2nd top CANNOT exceed the wick of the 1st top; or  
c)	The wick of the 2nd top can exceed the wick of the 1st top and the candle close of the 2nd top CAN exceed the wick of the 1st top; or  
d)	The wick of the 2nd top meets at least the candle close of the 1st top; or  
e)	The body of the 2nd top cannot exceed the body of the 1st top  

Personally, I would say all the above definitions work just fine although I do prefer definition a) because it means that the selling pressure is strong and the bulls fail to make a higher high. When there is a higher high formed in a downtrend, it can mean the downtrend has reversed and therefore you might not want to sell when the price pulls back to the 0.618 fib retracement.  

Note #2 ( 0.618 retracement ):  
When the price pulls back to 0.618, it does not mean to sell straight away. There must be more than one reason to sell other than the 0.618 retrace. The more reasons the better. In this example, you can see there are certainly structures (key resistance levels) at the 0.618 retrace. As well, there was a  double top  formed on the lower time frame. Consequently, you can sell.  

After  BTC -1.77%  hit the 0.618 retrace the first time, the price dropped from $9735 to $8650. but quickly bounced back to the 0.618 retrace level. That was a second & better opportunity to sell. Not only did  BTC -1.77%  form a  double top  on the larger time frame, but also with a  bearish  divergence on the 4hr time frame. Accordingly, you have more reasons to sell.  

Note #3 (Set take profit)  
Same as the rules of “Double top”, there are some variations as to which price level should you take profits. Personally, I would stick to the below:  
1)	First, take profit when risk/reward ratio hits 1:1 (recommend to take 30% - 50% profits and adjust the SL of the remaining positions to break-even)  
2)	When price hits the same price level as the low after the neckline is broken ((b) point in this example)  
3)	When price hits 1.272 fib extension of (a)(b)  
4)	When price hits point (d) (using  AB=CD  pattern. If you are not sure what the rules of  AB=CD  are, you can refer to my previous TA in which I have attached the link below)  
5)	If in a one-way market (heavily bearish/bullish), you can always keep 10% to 20% of your positions and take profits when risk/reward ratio hits 1:5 or even 1:10

Comment:
					Not sure why some people left comments in the comment section saying BTC is not going to 4k. 

This is an educational post which shows the normal ""trade setup"" for the 2618 pattern and the price level to take profits. This is certainly not a prediction to say BTC is going to 4k. Whoever says that my prediction is wrong and the price is not going to 4k just proved that you are just a novice trader and should go and do some study before making a comment.

 BTC -1.77%  is on the verge of breaking to a daily higher high on the bounce if the bulls can see a push this morning. 
If we reject from here the daily will form a lower high and we will see a tightening pattern within the highlighted  support and resistance  lines.  
Important for the bulls to show up or we could stay in this range into tomorrow.  
Healthy consolidation after the most recent bull move and the 15 min chart needs to change the trend.  
Also look to  EMA  12 support on the 4 hour and hourly.  
Another morning like yesterday with the bulls comfortable as worst case, we likely stay in the tightening pattern if bulls cannot prove themselves.

The current situation of  Bitcoin              is quite difficult. We are on a clear treshold. A lot of traders are saying that we are on a clear downtrend, but the same amount of people are claiming that we will have our reversal soon. 

This article tries to sum up all important information you have to need! 

1: Retracement of a parabolic uptrend: 
There is a rule of thumb for the retracement of a parabolic uptrend. We should retrace to approx. the 0.786  Fibonacci Retracement  +/- 10%! 
Depending where we start the count, we are already in that target. Although both ways (blue and red) have still some space for a further downwave! 







2: The bloody support of Bitcoin: 
The average cost of mining one  bitcoin              are at USA/Russia approx. 4700$ and at 3100$ for china! 
A drop below a target of 4700$ would be savage. Nevertheless, i can't image that we will hit that target. 







3: Manipulation of  Bitcoin              and the Bart Simpson Pattern: 
A friend of mine found some unusual patterns in the orderbooks of several exchanges: 
https://twitter.com/CryptoSyndrome 
Altcoins are manipulated on a daily basis. It seems that  bitcoin              is now affected to this too, which causes all these 3-5% pump and dumps. 
Thus, we are forming all the time the Bartin Simpsons Patterns. 

4: Similarity to 2014: 
Bitcoin              now: 






Bitcoin              2014: 







5: Deminishing downtrend and a strong support 
If we see the falling  wedges  as the force of the downtrend, then the force is diminishing! 
Furthermore we have strong support which is holding now for the 4th time! 







6: The Indicators 
Having a look at the indicators at 2D, we have a good potential for an upwave now. 
The  volume  is deminishing which should indicate a breakout soon. 
The  MACD  is about to cross, the  RSI  was slightly overbought and is heading up like the  Stoch .  RSI . 
The 200  EMA  is slighty under the current price and act as a support. 

7: The symetrical Triangle 
The theory says, that we should have in a  sym             . triangle 5 times an  ABC  wave. The waves are not perfect, but we can construct them. 






As you can see, the last four ABC-Waves formed always a 1:1 extention, which indicates that we have finished wave 5. 

8: A possible Head and Shoulders 
Even if this is not the most perfect  Head and Shoulders  Pattern, it's still valid! 
We are currently at the neckline, which is a strong and important resistance. Breaking upwards should indicate a good uptrend. 







9: The magic  6th              of the month 






Suprisingly we have on every  6th              of the month a reversal. Why is that??? 
One reason could be the  CME Group Futures  with dates for the settlements always nearby the  6th              of the month! 
http://www.cmegroup.com 

10: Longterm  Bullish  TA 
The whole pattern could be seen as a big  bullish pennant . 







11: Shortterm  Bullish  TA 
Leading diagonal  starting wave1 of an  Elliott Wave , since we have now an impulse wave, after the 5x  ABC  pattern inside the triangle is finished. 
Our target should be at the top of the triangle nearby 8600-8800$. 







12: Longterm  Bearish  TA 
We also can argue, that we are currenty in an downtrend and the  sym             . triangle just continuing the trend. 
Our target should be nearby 6000$ which is also a finished downwards  Elliott Wave .

Nothing is happening in the market:  volatility  has become extinct and coins' trading fallen out of fashion. Range-bound bots and robotic humans absolutely prosper in this environment. The price was unable to break the 7700 threshold. For me this is a  bearish  signal. Indicators provide mixed signals, so let's examine wave structure. The move from May 29 is a  3-wave -0.12%  correction within a larger downtrend. A price drop below 7500 would confirm this scenario.

Comment:
					Impulse Wave Truncation (Truncated Fifth) - 
Truncated 5th wave is when the market has become so over-extended in Wave 3 that there is not much force left for the impulse wave to come to a proper completion. So when this happens, there is a chance that the last wave of the impulse, Wave 5, will not reach the end of Wave 3 before the market starts correcting in the opposite direction. At this point, the market is just too exhausted. This condition is often called a “failure” or a “Truncation.”

I can see many people still believe that we are going inside a  descending triangle . I also believed this in my idea that i shard on may 1st: 



 

Things can change so quickly and if we didn't adapt to the changes then someone will. That's why i believe that we have to be in fast adapt mode in this market. Doesn't mean that you need to change without checking yourself. I try to find 2-3 confirmations before i change my idea on something. This includes pattern changes, trend changes etc 

There are 21 corrective wave patterns in EW which is categorized into major 3 corrective wave patterns: 

Zigzag  (5-3-5) 
Flat (3-3-5) 
Triangle (3-3-3-3-3) 

And other patterns are combinations of the above which is:  

Double three (A combination of two corrective patterns above) 
Triple three (A combination of three corrective patterns above) 

So what i can see now is that we are in two double three combination corrective wave pattern: 








More info here:  

https://elliottwave-forecast.com/elliott-wave-theory/#corrective-waves 

Confirmations: 

1. Wave ((i)) of C is 1.6k and ((v)) is going to be completed below the triangle 
2. Wave (E) of the triangle can't go beyond the triangle.  
3. This has happened twice before in 2013 & 2015 

Each wave  got 3 subwaves (a,b &c) inside and we are in the subwave c of ((y)) of Y which is an impulsive wave. 

Impulsive waves: 1,3,5,a,c 
Corrective waves: 2,4,b 

Normal Fibo Ratios for these waves are: 

wave 2 = 0.5 - 0.8 of wave 1  
wave 3 = 1.236 - 1.618 of wave 1  
wave 4 = 0.5 - 0.618 of wave 3  
wave 5 = 0.618 - 1 of wave 1  
wave B = 0.5 - 0.8 of wave A  
wave C = 0.618 - 1.236 of wave A  

Now if you check what happened in subwave a of ((y)) of Y you can see that: 

Wave (i) of a: 985$ 
Wave (ii) of a: 434$  
Wave ( iii -0.38% ) of a: 1207$  
Wave (iv) of a: 691$ [~0.618 of Wave ( iii -0.38% )] 
Wave (v) of a: 950$  








I have seen  BTC -1.77%  impulsive waves fibo ratios almost the same as the previous impulsive wave fibo ratios. 
Now if you apply the same for the last wave C of (E) this is what you get: 

Wave ((i)) of c: 1587$ 
Wave ((ii)) of c  = 793$ 
Wave (( iii -0.38% )) of c  = 1961$ 
Wave ((iv)) of c [~0.618 of Wave (( iii -0.38% ))] = 1212$ 
Wave ((v)) of c  = 1587$ 








Also note that Wave ((iv)) might not retrace upto 0.618 of Wave (( iii -0.38% )) as everyone will be in panic mode by that time so minimum retracement would be around 0.386 of Wave (( iii -0.38% )) which is around 756$ and this is why i can see it goes down to 5k level or little bit more towards 4.7k which is the lowest level of the  support zone  (orange dotted lines) 








So 3 Possible Support lines for reversal would be 

1. Blue: 5800 - 6100 (Only possible if Wave ((v)) is truncated) 
2. Orange: 4700 - 5000 (This is most likely where we heading)  
3. Red: 4100 - 4400 (Only possible if Wave (( iii -0.38% )) is extended)

 Bitcoin -1.77%  has recently developed an interesting pattern of completing a  bullish  and  bearish  cycle on the sixth of every month in an alternating order. As we can see in the chart above, a fall is followed by a rise. This has happened twice before and is expected to happen again now on the  6th 0.00%  of June, 2018. This time  Bitcoin -1.77%  will finish a  bearish  cycle and I expected to begin the next  bullish  cycle at least till the end of  6th 0.00%  of July, 2018. 

This pattern of rise and fall is also supported by other patterns on the chart that signal a  bullish  reversal. The support line has also held firmly and if this pattern of alternating rise and fall ensues,  Bitcoin -1.77%  could very well make new highs by the end of the year. The  RSI  is recovering from oversold levels and has now approached a normal.  Bitcoin -1.77%  is currently at a favorable point for  bullish  entries. The price broke a long term resistance as it break past the downtrend line in April, 2018. This was a big accomplishment for the bulls but the lack of confidence pulled the price back to the support line. Currently, the price is just above the support line and appears to be all set for a  bullish  comeback but the reality is, there are not enough bulls in the market. 

The past few months have been devastating for the price of  Bitcoin -1.77%  ( BTC -1.77% ) and a lot of investors are still running scared. Institutional investors are looking for more clarity regarding regulations concerning cryptocurrencies and also safer ways to invest and store their coins. As for retail investors, most of them comprise of first time investors who have never traded any financial asset before. So, when they saw that  Bitcoin -1.77%  ( BTC -1.77% ) is making 20% gains every day, they thought this could go on forever and jumped with both feet, only to find the carpet pulled under from their feet. Big investors have always played small investors as cannon fodder and have gotten away with their schemes even in regulated markets like forex or the stock market. Cryptocurrencies is a new market with no proper regulations which means it is natural to expect that those who can afford to not play by the rules, most likely won’t.

Hello friends,  

It's been a while since my last post; lack of time and an urge to do more research has mainly driven me to take a break from posting ideas on TradingView. I am still in the process of doing more research and study, but I figure posting once in a while couldn't hurt. 

Since I have become recently very convinced about this, I am outlining a very possible situation with  Bitcoin -1.77%  where the  trend line  we have been on since early October breaks, reaching around a temporary low of $5000. This is examined on the  daily chart , since this is one of the best charts to examine trends of this size. I have to first and foremost say that I am not trying to spread fear, I know many people do not like to hear  bearish  ideas, but  technical analysis  is ultimately a rational exercise, and I feel that possibilities with very strong signs should be explored. 

There are a few things to look at, but I first want to talk about the big picture with, long-term  support and resistance  lines. I think most people can agree that there was a very significant downtrending resistance line that began from the peak of the  ATH 0.63%  in late December, to the low of around $6400 (thick red line). After the break from that line, it seems we moved into a sideways trend, bouncing back and forth between an emerging downtrending resistance line (light red) and a support line that we seem to have been respecting since mid-October (light green); at least this appears to be the case with the lows, where the angle's effectiveness appears very strongly. Finally, based on previous bounces, we can establish a support of around $5000-$5300 (I've thus created a small  support zone  around that range, in dark green), as well as lower supports around $3200 and $2000 (though I do not believe these will be reached, in dark green).   

Now, onto the analysis - it's no secret that  Bitcoin -1.77%  has been squeezing in, ready for a significant move either upwards or downwards. Initially I considered the upwards move to be more likely due to the significant media attention cryptocurrency has been receiving, but after viewing previous market cycles of  Bitcoin -1.77%  (check 2013), it seems clear to me that the  bearish  scenario of closing in on the market cycle is very likely, and should at the very least be prepared for with proper risk management. According to Dow Theory, which is said to have laid the foundations of modern  technical analysis , history repeats itself, and this is a situation where we forced to consider this. 

Should we break from the line, we will likely fall straight down to the $5000-$5000 area, where we will shoot back up and bounce towards around $6700 or so (maybe a little less). From there one, we will likely enter a sideways trend, which we will continue until we see higher highs and higher lows and parabolic movement returns, which could lead to us challenging the all-time high, and hitting $35k-$50k. 

NOTE: I seem to have reached the max character limit for this section of the idea, so I will continue my text below.

Comment:
					Onto the short-term: 


Scenario A: 

The reason why I have drawn this movement into a pennant is this way, is simply because we have been moving through this ascending triangle for quite a while now (May 23rd to today). I don't think that the pattern will be sufficient to directly lead into a strong sell-off, but we should consider that the size of ascending triangle suggests a small movement downwards at the very least, which can create a higher low, and thus move into position into a bearish pennant. Why would a bearish pennant occur here and not have a bounce to $8500-$8700? The reason is in positioning - the huge downtrend (May 5th to May 26th) creates a very nice flagpole in which it hits around the $5000 area very perfectly, and thus I would not be surprised if this happens. 

Second reason: on the Stoch RSI indicator on the daily chart, it appears to be dangerously high, which would suggest it being oversold. For the most part, it seems to have called lows and highs, at least to some extent. This overdrawn movement may very well have increased the likelyhood of Bitcoin being oversold. This could suggest that this is the last step into a sharp downturn, but this does not preclude Situation B. Volume has also been steadily decreasing, but this is the case with any sort of consolidation, I believe. 

Finally, the lines I have drawn below the triangle are simply bounces that I think seem fairly reasonable. The length from to support to the lines correlate with the length of the flagpole, of course, though it may seem chopped off due to the huge line from the long-term support downwards. 


Scenario B: 

This is much simpler, Bitcoin hits the upper resistance line, bounces off, challenges the lower support line, and we potentially see a break, and the rest unfolds from there. 


----------------------------------------------------------------------- 


With all this being said, do not fear if you are hoping for more parabolic movement - this likely will not be the end, and will simply be the set up for a long, drawn out sideways movement until the first signs of bullish activity begin and we start all over again. If you are longing around here, please consider using risk management, prepare for every possibility. If you are shorting, the same applies. 

Please trade with care. I wish the best to all traders!

Comment:
					This really is a very minor note, but I just want to emphasize that the rising wedge (which I erroneously refer to as an ascending triangle, a bad habit I have) entering a bearish pennant is more based on intuition than anything. Also, this pennant is mainly based on the conservative assumption that the break will happen at 7900, if it happens at 7700 where we seem to be general resistance, the pennant would look something like this:

I am Mid term-bullish on  BTC -1.77%  going into the end of this week, but looking to get into the market on a pull back to occur before I get in to the market.  The jury is still out as to whether this weekly bear trend is ready to turn around.  

We can see that both the  RSI  and  MFI  are both  Bullish  on the daily having bottomed when reaching oversold on both at c. $7k support where we found our longer term  trend line . 

We are currently in the process of meeting the Tenkan (blue line) as I write this, so in the very short term, I am looking for a pull back to $7550 range for an entry.  One of the main reasons for this is that on the 4hour timeframes we are close to completing an edge to edge trade so the risk reward doesn’t fit my profile, however a break out from the cloud or above the Tenkan around $7777 will make me enter the market. 

The  RSI  and  MFI  have both been excellent indicators in this bear market.  Whenever  RSI  has gone above the 60 and the  MFI  80; its time to exit the market from a  bullish  trade and consider shorting as it progresses higher.   

Based on the  RSI ,  MFI  trends and the fact that we will run into the Kijun at just around $8-8.2k, I will be scalling out at this  bearish  confluence level to start looking for pull backs and reassessment as i believe it to be a key point as  

Best case scenario this trade would yield a 10% return before leverage. 
This is for illustrative purposes only, please DYOR and goodluck with your trading.

So the pullback trade that we were looking at worked out & has made it's way back to the neckline level of structure. We are now at what i like to call a ""decision point"" Essentially IF price is able to violate this current level od structure THEN we're likely to continue to our next price projection.  

Something that a lot of newer traders don't understand is that when it comes to bigger moves, the market will often provide multiple opportunities to get involved. For those who don't rush and for those who don't get discouraged. If you perform consistent analysis you can often find multiple ways to involve yourself in a trade even if you missed the first strike.

Here is a chart that we can understand the future price action and where to buy back. Before you guys start blasting my comment section with the time and how it may not be right thats correct. I am not calculating the time I'm just making a technical drawing of the directions that we will see in the next few months.  

Recent price action has clear signs of wash trading / market manipulation fud and lots of nonsense. Its hard to prove almost impossible so as a trader we just need to deal with it. Ideally the situation you are supposed to trade are critical break up and break down points to enter the trade. Dont enter or exit dumb trades and lose money. As an experienced trader you should be looking for shorts, I would not consider a long unless we are over $10-12k

I am never good with words so instead of writing paragraphs of clarification to justify my call for SHORT since my last posting, I have explained everything on my chart with the least words possible using Fibonacci. It does not matter how popular  Bitcoin -1.77%  has become, or how deep it has disrupted the financial sector, or how many institutional investors have come to invest in it -- the psychology behind a market cycle does not change. 

I don't really encourage anyone to short  Bitcoin -1.77% , but in all honesty, don't expect the bulls to fly anytime soon. Like I said before, this correction that we are having right now is the ""MOTHER OF ALL CORRECTIONS"" after a 4-year-long bull cycle since the 2013 correction... and we are just halfway through.

My best idea ever, taking some time off the last 2 days :) The whales just continue to play their little games by squeezing leveraged short and long positions out of the market. Can't play them, it's just too easy. Maybe it's time we retail traders stand together, combine our  volume  and use their own game against them. Yeah, maybe we could even make a blockbuster movie about this :) I love me some science fiction :) LOL  

My last update of the previous analysis i showed 2 important support levels where the price could bounce up from. The first support around 7350 did the trick and the price got pushed back to 7700. From that point on i told my members that i thought i was seeing distribution, but it was still very confusing to figure out what was going on. TA was showing  bullish  signs, that  bull flag  was very strong and was even turning slowly up and was about to squeeze upwards. But of course out of no where the price got dumped, the move we saw a few hours ago. After that 200 point drop the price got pushed up again to 7700 like that dump was a glitch. If your a whale, why not push out leveraged traders and take your money while your accumulating or distributing. It's like a bonus, like the cherry on top :)  

Anyway, in this chart we can see allot of similarities of what is going on. As you know i have been saying i am still  bearish  for the medium term, but i just could not say what was going to happen on the short term. 2 days ago after we finally dropped out of that  wedge , i said we would have 2 options.  
- Break those 2 support levels from the last update of my previous chart (73xx and 71xx) 
- Make a higher low at those same support levels and make another move up above the high.  
 
As we can see in the chart, the  fractal  is not 100% identical so it's no guarantee that the 7700 high we just saw is the high already and that we start to move down. But based on this  fractal , i don't want to see the price get above the 7800/7900. This  fractal  confirms my  bearish  view as well. That's why TA is so great, you can turn any chart to fit your view :). 

Even without this  fractal , i just give it a very small chance that 7K price action is the fundament of a low to start another bull rally, i just highly doubt that. I want to see more  volume  to begin with and at least  double bottom  kind of formation. So the minimum i expect is a test of the 7100/6900in the coming week or 2. But the movement i have in mind for the med term is a drop below the 7K to form a big V shape low. If we get to see that, than i might even become  bullish  for the rest of the year :).  

As long as the price stays above the 73xx, we have to assume the bulls are still in control and we should see another wave up. So for me the 73xx is an important turning point.

					At the moment it looks like bulls are trying to push higher, this bull flag/triangle is still very strong. So no sign of weakness yet! First small sign would be a drop below 7620/7600. Bulls need to break 7700

Comment:
					This is my bigger picture, think this bearish triangle is still 100% in play. I think if bulls can't break the 7800/7900 the bearish version is probably going to happen. Can't say HOW it will go, this blue line is just a guess. But a big V shape low would be the most bullish for the long term. I still think we are seeing distribution here. The only way this idea can be countered, is through a big increase of buying volume, if that doesn't happen, i think it's only a matter of time.

					What a surprise, nothing has changed :) 

The price took a small dump but the volume was low so no real read on what the intent was. So we might see another move up, if we start to see a small pump that takes out the 7800, be aware of a fake breakout. The blue line is a possibility of what the move could look like IF we move up and if the breakout fails. If that happens than we will probably get confirmation if the price breaks the 7600ish. If we break the 7800 it should stay above the 7700 to confirm another move up. Not much more to say about what's going on.

Comment:
					So we have made a small drop, but there is no volume confirming it, not yet at least. First small support has been broken, but not yet very meaningful because of the low volume. For the ones who shorted it, just be aware of another squeeze up, since this small move downwards looks a bit to controlled.  

Pure TA, it broke the channel and retested the former support as resistance now.

991,1528359434.0,Taiwan_Bear,2618 (Double top & 0.618 pull-back) - do not miss it!!,"




Jun 7




In the last couple of TAs I have mentioned the “2618 pattern” and have been asked what 2618 means. Sorry for taking it so long as it took me quite a while to put everything altogether. But, as promised, I have explained below the rules and trade setups for the 2618 pattern.  

What are the rules/setups/steps for 2618?  
1.	Form a  double top  (Note #1)  
2.	Neckline has to be broken  
3.	After price found support at point (b), wait for pull back to 0.618 fib retracement of (a)(b)  
4.	After price retraced to 0.618, look for confluence and sell (eg. Structures,  trendlines  ,  double top  on a lower time frame,  rsi  divergence,  bearish pin bar  ,  inside bar  break down etc.) (Note #2)  
5.	Stop loss to be set above  double top 
6.	Set Take Profit levels (Note #3)  

Note #1 ( Double top ):  
The first step for the formation of 2618 is to form a  double top  at key resistance levels. Why at key resistance levels? Because we want to avoid fake double tops which can occur occasionally.  

There are some variations between various resources (books, websites) regarding the definitions of “double top”. The main differences occur where:  
a)	Some said for a  double top  to be valid, the wick of the 2nd top cannot exceed the wick of the 1st top; whereas, others said:  
b)	The wick of the 2nd top can exceed the wick of the 1st top but the candle close of the 2nd top CANNOT exceed the wick of the 1st top; or  
c)	The wick of the 2nd top can exceed the wick of the 1st top and the candle close of the 2nd top CAN exceed the wick of the 1st top; or  
d)	The wick of the 2nd top meets at least the candle close of the 1st top; or  
e)	The body of the 2nd top cannot exceed the body of the 1st top  

Personally, I would say all the above definitions work just fine although I do prefer definition a) because it means that the selling pressure is strong and the bulls fail to make a higher high. When there is a higher high formed in a downtrend, it can mean the downtrend has reversed and therefore you might not want to sell when the price pulls back to the 0.618 fib retracement.  

Note #2 ( 0.618 retracement ):  
When the price pulls back to 0.618, it does not mean to sell straight away. There must be more than one reason to sell other than the 0.618 retrace. The more reasons the better. In this example, you can see there are certainly structures (key resistance levels) at the 0.618 retrace. As well, there was a  double top  formed on the lower time frame. Consequently, you can sell.  

After  BTC -1.78%  hit the 0.618 retrace the first time, the price dropped from $9735 to $8650. but quickly bounced back to the 0.618 retrace level. That was a second & better opportunity to sell. Not only did  BTC -1.78%  form a  double top  on the larger time frame, but also with a  bearish  divergence on the 4hr time frame. Accordingly, you have more reasons to sell.  

Note #3 (Set take profit)  
Same as the rules of “Double top”, there are some variations as to which price level should you take profits. Personally, I would stick to the below:  
1)	First, take profit when risk/reward ratio hits 1:1 (recommend to take 30% - 50% profits and adjust the SL of the remaining positions to break-even)  
2)	When price hits the same price level as the low after the neckline is broken ((b) point in this example)  
3)	When price hits 1.272 fib extension of (a)(b)  
4)	When price hits point (d) (using  AB=CD  pattern. If you are not sure what the rules of  AB=CD  are, you can refer to my previous TA in which I have attached the link below)  
5)	If in a one-way market (heavily bearish/bullish), you can always keep 10% to 20% of your positions and take profits when risk/reward ratio hits 1:5 or even 1:10

This is an educational post which shows the normal ""trade setup"" for the 2618 pattern and the price level to take profits. This is certainly not a prediction to say BTC is going to 4k. Whoever says that my prediction is wrong and the price is not going to 4k just proved that you are just a novice trader and should go and do some study before making a comment.

 BTC              is on the verge of breaking to a daily higher high on the bounce if the bulls can see a push this morning. 
If we reject from here the daily will form a lower high and we will see a tightening pattern within the highlighted  support and resistance  lines.  
Important for the bulls to show up or we could stay in this range into tomorrow.  
Healthy consolidation after the most recent bull move and the 15 min chart needs to change the trend.  
Also look to  EMA  12 support on the 4 hour and hourly.  
Another morning like yesterday with the bulls comfortable as worst case, we likely stay in the tightening pattern if bulls cannot prove themselves.

The current situation of  Bitcoin -1.78%  is quite difficult. We are on a clear treshold. A lot of traders are saying that we are on a clear downtrend, but the same amount of people are claiming that we will have our reversal soon. 

This article tries to sum up all important information you have to need! 

1: Retracement of a parabolic uptrend: 
There is a rule of thumb for the retracement of a parabolic uptrend. We should retrace to approx. the 0.786  Fibonacci Retracement  +/- 10%! 
Depending where we start the count, we are already in that target. Although both ways (blue and red) have still some space for a further downwave! 







2: The bloody support of Bitcoin: 
The average cost of mining one  bitcoin -1.78%  are at USA/Russia approx. 4700$ and at 3100$ for china! 
A drop below a target of 4700$ would be savage. Nevertheless, i can't image that we will hit that target. 







3: Manipulation of  Bitcoin -1.78%  and the Bart Simpson Pattern: 
A friend of mine found some unusual patterns in the orderbooks of several exchanges: 
https://twitter.com/CryptoSyndrome 
Altcoins are manipulated on a daily basis. It seems that  bitcoin -1.78%  is now affected to this too, which causes all these 3-5% pump and dumps. 
Thus, we are forming all the time the Bartin Simpsons Patterns. 

4: Similarity to 2014: 
Bitcoin -1.78%  now: 






Bitcoin -1.78%  2014: 







5: Deminishing downtrend and a strong support 
If we see the falling  wedges  as the force of the downtrend, then the force is diminishing! 
Furthermore we have strong support which is holding now for the 4th time! 







6: The Indicators 
Having a look at the indicators at 2D, we have a good potential for an upwave now. 
The  volume  is deminishing which should indicate a breakout soon. 
The  MACD  is about to cross, the  RSI  was slightly overbought and is heading up like the  Stoch .  RSI . 
The 200  EMA  is slighty under the current price and act as a support. 

7: The symetrical Triangle 
The theory says, that we should have in a  sym -0.80% . triangle 5 times an  ABC  wave. The waves are not perfect, but we can construct them. 






As you can see, the last four ABC-Waves formed always a 1:1 extention, which indicates that we have finished wave 5. 

8: A possible Head and Shoulders 
Even if this is not the most perfect  Head and Shoulders  Pattern, it's still valid! 
We are currently at the neckline, which is a strong and important resistance. Breaking upwards should indicate a good uptrend. 







9: The magic  6th 0.00%  of the month 






Suprisingly we have on every  6th 0.00%  of the month a reversal. Why is that??? 
One reason could be the  CME Group Futures  with dates for the settlements always nearby the  6th 0.00%  of the month! 
http://www.cmegroup.com 

10: Longterm  Bullish  TA 
The whole pattern could be seen as a big  bullish pennant . 







11: Shortterm  Bullish  TA 
Leading diagonal  starting wave1 of an  Elliott Wave , since we have now an impulse wave, after the 5x  ABC  pattern inside the triangle is finished. 
Our target should be at the top of the triangle nearby 8600-8800$. 







12: Longterm  Bearish  TA 
We also can argue, that we are currenty in an downtrend and the  sym -0.80% . triangle just continuing the trend. 
Our target should be nearby 6000$ which is also a finished downwards  Elliott Wave .

Nothing is happening in the market:  volatility  has become extinct and coins' trading fallen out of fashion. Range-bound bots and robotic humans absolutely prosper in this environment. The price was unable to break the 7700 threshold. For me this is a  bearish  signal. Indicators provide mixed signals, so let's examine wave structure. The move from May 29 is a  3-wave              correction within a larger downtrend. A price drop below 7500 would confirm this scenario.

					Impulse Wave Truncation (Truncated Fifth) - 
Truncated 5th wave is when the market has become so over-extended in Wave 3 that there is not much force left for the impulse wave to come to a proper completion. So when this happens, there is a chance that the last wave of the impulse, Wave 5, will not reach the end of Wave 3 before the market starts correcting in the opposite direction. At this point, the market is just too exhausted. This condition is often called a “failure” or a “Truncation.”

I can see many people still believe that we are going inside a  descending triangle . I also believed this in my idea that i shard on may 1st: 



 

Things can change so quickly and if we didn't adapt to the changes then someone will. That's why i believe that we have to be in fast adapt mode in this market. Doesn't mean that you need to change without checking yourself. I try to find 2-3 confirmations before i change my idea on something. This includes pattern changes, trend changes etc 

There are 21 corrective wave patterns in EW which is categorized into major 3 corrective wave patterns:

Double three (A combination of two corrective patterns above) 
Triple three (A combination of three corrective patterns above) 

So what i can see now is that we are in two double three combination corrective wave pattern: 








More info here:  

https://elliottwave-forecast.com/elliott-wave-theory/#corrective-waves 

Confirmations: 

1. Wave ((i)) of C is 1.6k and ((v)) is going to be completed below the triangle 
2. Wave (E) of the triangle can't go beyond the triangle.  
3. This has happened twice before in 2013 & 2015 

Each wave  got 3 subwaves (a,b &c) inside and we are in the subwave c of ((y)) of Y which is an impulsive wave. 

Impulsive waves: 1,3,5,a,c 
Corrective waves: 2,4,b 

Normal Fibo Ratios for these waves are: 

wave 2 = 0.5 - 0.8 of wave 1  
wave 3 = 1.236 - 1.618 of wave 1  
wave 4 = 0.5 - 0.618 of wave 3  
wave 5 = 0.618 - 1 of wave 1  
wave B = 0.5 - 0.8 of wave A  
wave C = 0.618 - 1.236 of wave A  

Now if you check what happened in subwave a of ((y)) of Y you can see that: 

Wave (i) of a: 985$ 
Wave (ii) of a: 434$  
Wave ( iii             ) of a: 1207$  
Wave (iv) of a: 691$ [~0.618 of Wave ( iii             )] 
Wave (v) of a: 950$  








I have seen  BTC              impulsive waves fibo ratios almost the same as the previous impulsive wave fibo ratios. 
Now if you apply the same for the last wave C of (E) this is what you get: 

Wave ((i)) of c: 1587$ 
Wave ((ii)) of c  = 793$ 
Wave (( iii             )) of c  = 1961$ 
Wave ((iv)) of c [~0.618 of Wave (( iii             ))] = 1212$ 
Wave ((v)) of c  = 1587$ 








Also note that Wave ((iv)) might not retrace upto 0.618 of Wave (( iii             )) as everyone will be in panic mode by that time so minimum retracement would be around 0.386 of Wave (( iii             )) which is around 756$ and this is why i can see it goes down to 5k level or little bit more towards 4.7k which is the lowest level of the  support zone  (orange dotted lines) 








So 3 Possible Support lines for reversal would be 

1. Blue: 5800 - 6100 (Only possible if Wave ((v)) is truncated) 
2. Orange: 4700 - 5000 (This is most likely where we heading)  
3. Red: 4100 - 4400 (Only possible if Wave (( iii             )) is extended)

 Bitcoin -1.78%  has recently developed an interesting pattern of completing a  bullish  and  bearish  cycle on the sixth of every month in an alternating order. As we can see in the chart above, a fall is followed by a rise. This has happened twice before and is expected to happen again now on the  6th              of June, 2018. This time  Bitcoin -1.78%  will finish a  bearish  cycle and I expected to begin the next  bullish  cycle at least till the end of  6th              of July, 2018. 

This pattern of rise and fall is also supported by other patterns on the chart that signal a  bullish  reversal. The support line has also held firmly and if this pattern of alternating rise and fall ensues,  Bitcoin -1.78%  could very well make new highs by the end of the year. The  RSI  is recovering from oversold levels and has now approached a normal.  Bitcoin -1.78%  is currently at a favorable point for  bullish  entries. The price broke a long term resistance as it break past the downtrend line in April, 2018. This was a big accomplishment for the bulls but the lack of confidence pulled the price back to the support line. Currently, the price is just above the support line and appears to be all set for a  bullish  comeback but the reality is, there are not enough bulls in the market. 

The past few months have been devastating for the price of  Bitcoin -1.78%  ( BTC -1.78% ) and a lot of investors are still running scared. Institutional investors are looking for more clarity regarding regulations concerning cryptocurrencies and also safer ways to invest and store their coins. As for retail investors, most of them comprise of first time investors who have never traded any financial asset before. So, when they saw that  Bitcoin -1.78%  ( BTC -1.78% ) is making 20% gains every day, they thought this could go on forever and jumped with both feet, only to find the carpet pulled under from their feet. Big investors have always played small investors as cannon fodder and have gotten away with their schemes even in regulated markets like forex or the stock market. Cryptocurrencies is a new market with no proper regulations which means it is natural to expect that those who can afford to not play by the rules, most likely won’t.

Hello friends,  

It's been a while since my last post; lack of time and an urge to do more research has mainly driven me to take a break from posting ideas on TradingView. I am still in the process of doing more research and study, but I figure posting once in a while couldn't hurt. 

Since I have become recently very convinced about this, I am outlining a very possible situation with  Bitcoin              where the  trend line  we have been on since early October breaks, reaching around a temporary low of $5000. This is examined on the  daily chart , since this is one of the best charts to examine trends of this size. I have to first and foremost say that I am not trying to spread fear, I know many people do not like to hear  bearish  ideas, but  technical analysis  is ultimately a rational exercise, and I feel that possibilities with very strong signs should be explored. 

There are a few things to look at, but I first want to talk about the big picture with, long-term  support and resistance  lines. I think most people can agree that there was a very significant downtrending resistance line that began from the peak of the  ATH              in late December, to the low of around $6400 (thick red line). After the break from that line, it seems we moved into a sideways trend, bouncing back and forth between an emerging downtrending resistance line (light red) and a support line that we seem to have been respecting since mid-October (light green); at least this appears to be the case with the lows, where the angle's effectiveness appears very strongly. Finally, based on previous bounces, we can establish a support of around $5000-$5300 (I've thus created a small  support zone  around that range, in dark green), as well as lower supports around $3200 and $2000 (though I do not believe these will be reached, in dark green).   

Now, onto the analysis - it's no secret that  Bitcoin              has been squeezing in, ready for a significant move either upwards or downwards. Initially I considered the upwards move to be more likely due to the significant media attention cryptocurrency has been receiving, but after viewing previous market cycles of  Bitcoin              (check 2013), it seems clear to me that the  bearish  scenario of closing in on the market cycle is very likely, and should at the very least be prepared for with proper risk management. According to Dow Theory, which is said to have laid the foundations of modern  technical analysis , history repeats itself, and this is a situation where we forced to consider this. 

Should we break from the line, we will likely fall straight down to the $5000-$5000 area, where we will shoot back up and bounce towards around $6700 or so (maybe a little less). From there one, we will likely enter a sideways trend, which we will continue until we see higher highs and higher lows and parabolic movement returns, which could lead to us challenging the all-time high, and hitting $35k-$50k. 

NOTE: I seem to have reached the max character limit for this section of the idea, so I will continue my text below.

Comment:
					Onto the short-term: 


Scenario A: 

The reason why I have drawn this movement into a pennant is this way, is simply because we have been moving through this ascending triangle for quite a while now (May 23rd to today). I don't think that the pattern will be sufficient to directly lead into a strong sell-off, but we should consider that the size of ascending triangle suggests a small movement downwards at the very least, which can create a higher low, and thus move into position into a bearish pennant. Why would a bearish pennant occur here and not have a bounce to $8500-$8700? The reason is in positioning - the huge downtrend (May 5th to May 26th) creates a very nice flagpole in which it hits around the $5000 area very perfectly, and thus I would not be surprised if this happens. 

Second reason: on the Stoch RSI indicator on the daily chart, it appears to be dangerously high, which would suggest it being oversold. For the most part, it seems to have called lows and highs, at least to some extent. This overdrawn movement may very well have increased the likelyhood of Bitcoin being oversold. This could suggest that this is the last step into a sharp downturn, but this does not preclude Situation B. Volume has also been steadily decreasing, but this is the case with any sort of consolidation, I believe. 

Finally, the lines I have drawn below the triangle are simply bounces that I think seem fairly reasonable. The length from to support to the lines correlate with the length of the flagpole, of course, though it may seem chopped off due to the huge line from the long-term support downwards. 


Scenario B: 

This is much simpler, Bitcoin hits the upper resistance line, bounces off, challenges the lower support line, and we potentially see a break, and the rest unfolds from there. 


----------------------------------------------------------------------- 


With all this being said, do not fear if you are hoping for more parabolic movement - this likely will not be the end, and will simply be the set up for a long, drawn out sideways movement until the first signs of bullish activity begin and we start all over again. If you are longing around here, please consider using risk management, prepare for every possibility. If you are shorting, the same applies. 

Please trade with care. I wish the best to all traders!

Comment:
					This really is a very minor note, but I just want to emphasize that the rising wedge (which I erroneously refer to as an ascending triangle, a bad habit I have) entering a bearish pennant is more based on intuition than anything. Also, this pennant is mainly based on the conservative assumption that the break will happen at 7900, if it happens at 7700 where we seem to be general resistance, the pennant would look something like this:

Jun 7




I am Mid term-bullish on  BTC -1.78%  going into the end of this week, but looking to get into the market on a pull back to occur before I get in to the market.  The jury is still out as to whether this weekly bear trend is ready to turn around.  

We can see that both the  RSI  and  MFI  are both  Bullish  on the daily having bottomed when reaching oversold on both at c. $7k support where we found our longer term  trend line . 

We are currently in the process of meeting the Tenkan (blue line) as I write this, so in the very short term, I am looking for a pull back to $7550 range for an entry.  One of the main reasons for this is that on the 4hour timeframes we are close to completing an edge to edge trade so the risk reward doesn’t fit my profile, however a break out from the cloud or above the Tenkan around $7777 will make me enter the market. 

The  RSI  and  MFI  have both been excellent indicators in this bear market.  Whenever  RSI  has gone above the 60 and the  MFI  80; its time to exit the market from a  bullish  trade and consider shorting as it progresses higher.   

Based on the  RSI ,  MFI  trends and the fact that we will run into the Kijun at just around $8-8.2k, I will be scalling out at this  bearish  confluence level to start looking for pull backs and reassessment as i believe it to be a key point as  

Best case scenario this trade would yield a 10% return before leverage. 
This is for illustrative purposes only, please DYOR and goodluck with your trading.

So the pullback trade that we were looking at worked out & has made it's way back to the neckline level of structure. We are now at what i like to call a ""decision point"" Essentially IF price is able to violate this current level od structure THEN we're likely to continue to our next price projection.  

Something that a lot of newer traders don't understand is that when it comes to bigger moves, the market will often provide multiple opportunities to get involved. For those who don't rush and for those who don't get discouraged. If you perform consistent analysis you can often find multiple ways to involve yourself in a trade even if you missed the first strike.

This is the way markets move, If you question my charting check my previous posts. Its as simple as pie. We are going down, How long and how far is too soon to say. Here is a chart that we can understand the future price action and where to buy back. Before you guys start blasting my comment section with the time and how it may not be right thats correct. I am not calculating the time I'm just making a technical drawing of the directions that we will see in the next few months.  

Recent price action has clear signs of wash trading / market manipulation fud and lots of nonsense. Its hard to prove almost impossible so as a trader we just need to deal with it. Ideally the situation you are supposed to trade are critical break up and break down points to enter the trade. Dont enter or exit dumb trades and lose money. As an experienced trader you should be looking for shorts, I would not consider a long unless we are over $10-12k

I am never good with words so instead of writing paragraphs of clarification to justify my call for SHORT since my last posting, I have explained everything on my chart with the least words possible using Fibonacci. It does not matter how popular  Bitcoin -1.78%  has become, or how deep it has disrupted the financial sector, or how many institutional investors have come to invest in it -- the psychology behind a market cycle does not change. 

I don't really encourage anyone to short  Bitcoin -1.78% , but in all honesty, don't expect the bulls to fly anytime soon. Like I said before, this correction that we are having right now is the ""MOTHER OF ALL CORRECTIONS"" after a 4-year-long bull cycle since the 2013 correction... and we are just halfway through.
