I tried to make a good reflection of the whole cryptomarket. I only could do this with coins that been trading for more than a year. Otherwise the chart did not work. So I made a chart with the following coins: 
BTC -0.76% , ETH, XRP, LTC, DASH, NEO, MONERO,  XEM -1.35% 

If people also wanna chart on this chart use the following ticker: 
COINBASE:BTCUSD*16692550+BITFINEX:ETHUSD*92862174+BITTREX:XRPUSD*38622892459+BITFINEX:LTCUSD*53927233+BITTREX:DASHUSD*7701656+BITTREX:NEOUSD*65000000+BITTREX:XMRUSD*15377976+BITTREX:XEMUSD*8999999999 

About the charts 
The first chart you see is on the logic alghoritme. The second one in normal view. 

On the first alghoritme we see a big rising wedge! On the second one you see the beautifull elliot-wave pattern. The 5th wave or 3th wave up reached the 1.618 fibonacci level, the same level als the last crash.  

I think there could be an abc-correction wave. With a total retracement of the whole cryptocurrancy market of 35-55%. 

Some other information to think about. Correct me when i'm wrong! 
First crash:  
-20 june the total marketcap of cryptocurrancies was 115 million.  
-16 july the total marketcap of cryptocurrancies 67 million  

Trigger: The first  bitcoin -0.76%  fork?  

Second crash:  
-1 september the total marketcap of cryptocurrancies was 174 million.  
-15 september the total marketcap of cryptocurrancies was 109 million.  

Trigger: China Ban?  

The last and upcomming crash>  
It should be time for a correction of the total market! I think there is a huge change.  

Trigger: I really think the Tether usd hack could trigger a crash.  

Last thing I want to say, I try to do an objective view. I believe it will happen. You don't have to agree with me, take your own conclusion!

Total marketcap: 54.000.000.000 / 44% = 122.727.000.000 usd 
Bitcoin: 122.727.000.000 - 54.000.000.000 = 68.727.000.000 usd 

So the bitcoin should multiplied by 68.727.000.000 / 138.000.000.000 = 50%

Get ready to DASH when the dollar goes digital! 


Dash -1.62%  is one of my favourite altcoins with respect to crypto as a globally scalable currency instead of a flawed overbought asset or fancy network-platform disguised as a currency. 
Day trading in the ultra-short ranges along with wave traders and bandwagon enthusiasts may seem appealing to a ripoff alt coin, but when it comes to Dash, the bears may be devastated by the returns the bulls will brag about in the years to come. 

If any cryptocurrency is going to disrupt fiat forex and drop the world on its head, the chances are in favour of Dash. The only currency powerful enough to challenge Dash in a race will resemble the digital dollar, or literally be a BANKcoin/FEDcoin issued by the whales of central/retail banking. 
Gold 0.15%  and  silver -0.95%  are no longer used as a currency, or even as a backing-asset anymore. The only system on Earth hoarding  gold 0.15%  are the reserves, or industry players directly involved in the utilitarian usage of the metal. 
Backing a currency by the  gold 0.15%  standard is no longer what Planet Earth chooses to do with their matter. Fiat is now lubricating the cogs of finance and society, driving us forward into the future of money! 
Maybe even the martians understand the benefits of a digital dollar or even Dash over the illusion of metallic gold? 

My positions still remain the same from 2018 - 2020: 
Dash is basically Litecoin 2.0 and  Bitcoin -0.76%  3.0 

1.  Bitcoin -0.62%  is an awesome historic asset, not a viable global currency. (LONG) 
2.  Bitcoin Cash -2.33%  is a sham, and worth less than the pixels of this text you are reading (0.0). (DUMP) 
3.  Ethereum -0.12% may be shorted heavily in June for  BTC -0.62%  but is still a really cool network-platform! (LONG) 
4.  Litecoin -1.62%  is kind of a sham as well...Repeat the mistakes of  Bitcoin -0.76% , pump it up and hope nobody finds out before it is too late! (DUMP) 
5.  Eos -4.73%  is pretty cool as well! An innovative platform with room to grow, but not a true cryptocurrency (LONG) 
6.  Dash -1.62%  is the star of the show, and the reason for this chart. No other crypto is positioned in the market to scale globally as big as Dash is! (LONG) 

I will probably chart all of the cryptos I discussed to go into details on each, and clarify what my projections and positions are currently. 
With a future so bright and a fresh cryptocurrency ready to visit the moon, why would I want to short so early and lose out? 
If you miss out on the small pop & drop, keep tuned for market moves over the next few months. 
We live in an amazing world, and I am very excited for what tomorrow holds!

Comment:
					I also want to add that I am not paid by ANYBODY to market or shill/pitch their products. My charts are backed by where my investments are or where my head is at. 

If I make a call that a project is doomed, it is not because I want to crash the market price for revenge, or to trick others into handing me their crypto at rock-bottom prices. 

It is because I want to get a timestamp next to my ideas, to come back down the road later and see how my investments line up with the progress of the crypto industry overall. 

If someone pays me to peddle their coin to my TV followers/readers, I will make it extremely clear I have an incentive for my opinions outside of what I am already invested in.

8,1528431622.0,Procinctu,Bollinger Band Squeeze: Will Volatility pick up on DASH?,"
DASH has been fairly stagnant over the last few days. On several time frames, conditions for a  Bollinger Band  Squeeze are met. 

You can visibly see on the chart that the bands are contracting. Another thing you want to look for is the  Bollinger Band  Width. On a daily, many look for a 6 month low for the squeeze to be in play. 

As this is the 4 hour chart, the equivalent of 30 days would be about the same amount of candles as if it were a  daily chart . Interestingly, that last time the  Bollinger Band  Width was THIS low, was just before the big Crypto run up in late 2017. 

I don't know that the same kind of  volatility  from 2017 will come in just yet....but the probability is increased that some form of  volatility  can be expected...in either direction, up or down.

11,1527710414.0,Tradingstrategyguides,DASH SPIKE & LEDGE REVERSAL CRYPTO STRATEGY,"




May 30




Step #1: Dash cryptocurrency price needs to show a steady rise that suddenly accelerates to the upside. 
When this reversal pattern is complete, it will resemble a cup with a sharp bottom. 
This sharp acceleration usually is the last stage of a bull cryptocurrency market, and it’s followed by a sharp reversal if all the trading criteria for a valid Spike and Ledge are met. 
In  technical analysis , professional traders also refer to this last spike as being an exhaustion reversal bar that has a high probability of signaling a reversal in the Dash price. 
Now, before we can trade successfully, we need to understand that this key climax reversal bar needs to follow specific trading rules. 
More specifically, this exhaustion reversal bar needs to follow three rules, which we’re going to highlight next. 
Step #2: The exhaustion reversal bar needs to be bigger than the previous bar 
Relatively speaking the exhaustion bar, which should be the last bar within the downtrend, needs to be bigger than the previous bars. However, this is not mandatory. 
Ideally, the bigger the climax bar is in comparison with the other bars within the  bullish trend , the more profitable the reversal pattern becomes. 
Step #3: The climax bar needs to develop at a key sup/res level or after breaking a key swing low/high 
We can’t stress enough the importance of location in trading. 
Many times you’ll notice that a chart pattern will fail, but that’s not because that price pattern has stopped working. It’s often the case that you don’t have the patience for these patterns to develop at the right location. 
In order for the Dash cryptocurrency trading strategy to work we need to wait for the exhaustion bar to show up at the right location. 
Step #4: The exhaustion bar develops after several  bullish  impulsive bars 
We need to make sure that the exhaustion bar occurs after several  bullish  impulsive bars. 
These impulsive  bullish  bars will make the appearance of a  bullish trend  that will trap many sellers once the tide turns. And that’s how retail traders trade the markets, but to trade profitably, you need to trade against the retail mindset. 
Step #5: After the upward spike, wait for the market to enter into a short period of consolidation or channeling. 
Usually, after the Dash cryptocurrency price had that last spike up the market will take a pause to digest the recent move, and it will start moving into a short period of consolidation or channeling. 
Simply, draw two parallel lines to contain this price range. 
Now, this is what we refer to as being the “Ledge.” 
The Spike and Ledge reversal pattern satisfies all trading conditions outlined above which mean that we can move forward and describe how to sell Dash coin. 
Step #6: Sell Dash coin when we break below the Ledge 
A short trade is entered on the breakout of the Ledge. 
This is an easy entry method, but in order to avoid the short-term noise and the usual false breakouts, we need also to wait for the breakout candle to close below the Ledge. 
Step #7: Place your protective Stop Loss above the Exhaustion bar 
The initial protective stop loss is placed on the other side of the reversal pattern. 
You hide your stop loss above the exhaustion bar. 
Step #8: Your Take Profit needs to be two or three times bigger than your risk aka your stop loss. 
As a general rule, you do want your take profit to be bigger than your stop loss. This is very important to your long-term survival in this business. 
However, you can achieve your profit target goals by using your preferred strategy when it comes to exit the market. We encourage you to experiment different exit strategies and see which one yields better results. 
Note** the above was an example of a SELL trade using our favorite Dash strategy. Use the same rules for a BUY trade – but in reverse.

13,1528131496.0,FX_Academy,Dash (DASH/USD) still in a correction ,"
The price of Dash has retraced to the starting point of an impulse wave, which discards the possibility that the first upside impulse was a wave 1 from a larger degree, because if that was the case wave 2 couldn't retrace 100% as the price did. So we are seeing another corrective wave and it's likely going to be a Y wave from a WXY correction in the opposite direction from the massive  ABC  move we saw prior. That would all mean that another down move is coming after the Y ends on the upside.

6.  Dash -1.10%  is the star of the show, and the reason for this chart. No other crypto is positioned in the market to scale globally as big as Dash is! (LONG) 

I will probably chart all of the cryptos I discussed to go into details on each, and clarify what my projections and positions are currently.

26,1528431622.0,Procinctu,Bollinger Band Squeeze: Will Volatility pick up on DASH?,"
DASH has been fairly stagnant over the last few days. On several time frames, conditions for a  Bollinger Band  Squeeze are met. 

You can visibly see on the chart that the bands are contracting. Another thing you want to look for is the  Bollinger Band  Width. On a daily, many look for a 6 month low for the squeeze to be in play. 

As this is the 4 hour chart, the equivalent of 30 days would be about the same amount of candles as if it were a  daily chart . Interestingly, that last time the  Bollinger Band  Width was THIS low, was just before the big Crypto run up in late 2017. 

I don't know that the same kind of  volatility  from 2017 will come in just yet....but the probability is increased that some form of  volatility  can be expected...in either direction, up or down.

29,1527710414.0,Tradingstrategyguides,DASH SPIKE & LEDGE REVERSAL CRYPTO STRATEGY,"




May 30




Step #1: Dash cryptocurrency price needs to show a steady rise that suddenly accelerates to the upside. 
When this reversal pattern is complete, it will resemble a cup with a sharp bottom. 
This sharp acceleration usually is the last stage of a bull cryptocurrency market, and it’s followed by a sharp reversal if all the trading criteria for a valid Spike and Ledge are met. 
In  technical analysis , professional traders also refer to this last spike as being an exhaustion reversal bar that has a high probability of signaling a reversal in the Dash price. 
Now, before we can trade successfully, we need to understand that this key climax reversal bar needs to follow specific trading rules. 
More specifically, this exhaustion reversal bar needs to follow three rules, which we’re going to highlight next. 
Step #2: The exhaustion reversal bar needs to be bigger than the previous bar 
Relatively speaking the exhaustion bar, which should be the last bar within the downtrend, needs to be bigger than the previous bars. However, this is not mandatory. 
Ideally, the bigger the climax bar is in comparison with the other bars within the  bullish trend , the more profitable the reversal pattern becomes. 
Step #3: The climax bar needs to develop at a key sup/res level or after breaking a key swing low/high 
We can’t stress enough the importance of location in trading. 
Many times you’ll notice that a chart pattern will fail, but that’s not because that price pattern has stopped working. It’s often the case that you don’t have the patience for these patterns to develop at the right location. 
In order for the Dash cryptocurrency trading strategy to work we need to wait for the exhaustion bar to show up at the right location. 
Step #4: The exhaustion bar develops after several  bullish  impulsive bars 
We need to make sure that the exhaustion bar occurs after several  bullish  impulsive bars. 
These impulsive  bullish  bars will make the appearance of a  bullish trend  that will trap many sellers once the tide turns. And that’s how retail traders trade the markets, but to trade profitably, you need to trade against the retail mindset. 
Step #5: After the upward spike, wait for the market to enter into a short period of consolidation or channeling. 
Usually, after the Dash cryptocurrency price had that last spike up the market will take a pause to digest the recent move, and it will start moving into a short period of consolidation or channeling. 
Simply, draw two parallel lines to contain this price range. 
Now, this is what we refer to as being the “Ledge.” 
The Spike and Ledge reversal pattern satisfies all trading conditions outlined above which mean that we can move forward and describe how to sell Dash coin. 
Step #6: Sell Dash coin when we break below the Ledge 
A short trade is entered on the breakout of the Ledge. 
This is an easy entry method, but in order to avoid the short-term noise and the usual false breakouts, we need also to wait for the breakout candle to close below the Ledge. 
Step #7: Place your protective Stop Loss above the Exhaustion bar 
The initial protective stop loss is placed on the other side of the reversal pattern. 
You hide your stop loss above the exhaustion bar. 
Step #8: Your Take Profit needs to be two or three times bigger than your risk aka your stop loss. 
As a general rule, you do want your take profit to be bigger than your stop loss. This is very important to your long-term survival in this business. 
However, you can achieve your profit target goals by using your preferred strategy when it comes to exit the market. We encourage you to experiment different exit strategies and see which one yields better results. 
Note** the above was an example of a SELL trade using our favorite Dash strategy. Use the same rules for a BUY trade – but in reverse.

The price of Dash has retraced to the starting point of an impulse wave, which discards the possibility that the first upside impulse was a wave 1 from a larger degree, because if that was the case wave 2 couldn't retrace 100% as the price did. So we are seeing another corrective wave and it's likely going to be a Y wave from a WXY correction in the opposite direction from the massive  ABC  move we saw prior. That would all mean that another down move is coming after the Y ends on the upside.

I tried to make a good reflection of the whole cryptomarket. I only could do this with coins that been trading for more than a year. Otherwise the chart did not work. So I made a chart with the following coins: 
BTC -0.74% , ETH, XRP, LTC, DASH, NEO, MONERO,  XEM -1.35% 

If people also wanna chart on this chart use the following ticker: 
COINBASE:BTCUSD*16692550+BITFINEX:ETHUSD*92862174+BITTREX:XRPUSD*38622892459+BITFINEX:LTCUSD*53927233+BITTREX:DASHUSD*7701656+BITTREX:NEOUSD*65000000+BITTREX:XMRUSD*15377976+BITTREX:XEMUSD*8999999999 

About the charts 
The first chart you see is on the logic alghoritme. The second one in normal view. 

On the first alghoritme we see a big rising wedge! On the second one you see the beautifull elliot-wave pattern. The 5th wave or 3th wave up reached the 1.618 fibonacci level, the same level als the last crash.  

I think there could be an abc-correction wave. With a total retracement of the whole cryptocurrancy market of 35-55%. 

Some other information to think about. Correct me when i'm wrong! 
First crash:  
-20 june the total marketcap of cryptocurrancies was 115 million.  
-16 july the total marketcap of cryptocurrancies 67 million  

Trigger: The first  bitcoin -0.74%  fork?  

Second crash:  
-1 september the total marketcap of cryptocurrancies was 174 million.  
-15 september the total marketcap of cryptocurrancies was 109 million.  

Trigger: China Ban?  

The last and upcomming crash>  
It should be time for a correction of the total market! I think there is a huge change.  

Trigger: I really think the Tether usd hack could trigger a crash.  

Last thing I want to say, I try to do an objective view. I believe it will happen. You don't have to agree with me, take your own conclusion!

The bitcoin dominance is 56%. So the total marketcap of the other coins should be 44%. 

Total marketcap: 54.000.000.000 / 44% = 122.727.000.000 usd 
Bitcoin: 122.727.000.000 - 54.000.000.000 = 68.727.000.000 usd

Technical analysis: 
DASH/DOLLAR is in a range bound and beginning of up trend is expected.  
The price is below the 21-Day WEMA which acts as a dynamic resistance.  
The  RSI  is at 47.  

Trading suggestion: 
The price is in a range bound, but we forecast the uptrend would begin.  
There is possibility of temporary retracement to suggested  support zone  (417 to 281), if so, traders can set orders based on Daily-Trading-Opportunities and expect to reach short-term targets.  

Beginning of entry zone (417)  
Ending of entry zone (281)  

Entry signal: 
Signal to enter the market occurs when the price comes to ""Buy zone"" then forms one of the reversal patterns, whether ""Bullish Engulfing"", ""Hammer"" or ""Valley"", in other words,  
NO entry signal when the price comes to the zone BUT after any of reversal patterns is formed in the zone.

Get ready to DASH when the dollar goes digital! 


Dash -1.10%  is one of my favourite altcoins with respect to crypto as a globally scalable currency instead of a flawed overbought asset or fancy network-platform disguised as a currency. 
Day trading in the ultra-short ranges along with wave traders and bandwagon enthusiasts may seem appealing to a ripoff alt coin, but when it comes to Dash, the bears may be devastated by the returns the bulls will brag about in the years to come. 

If any cryptocurrency is going to disrupt fiat forex and drop the world on its head, the chances are in favour of Dash. The only currency powerful enough to challenge Dash in a race will resemble the digital dollar, or literally be a BANKcoin/FEDcoin issued by the whales of central/retail banking. 
Gold 0.14%  and  silver -0.89%  are no longer used as a currency, or even as a backing-asset anymore. The only system on Earth hoarding  gold 0.14%  are the reserves, or industry players directly involved in the utilitarian usage of the metal. 
Backing a currency by the  gold 0.14%  standard is no longer what Planet Earth chooses to do with their matter. Fiat is now lubricating the cogs of finance and society, driving us forward into the future of money! 
Maybe even the martians understand the benefits of a digital dollar or even Dash over the illusion of metallic gold? 

My positions still remain the same from 2018 - 2020: 
Dash is basically Litecoin 2.0 and  Bitcoin -0.74%  3.0 

1.  Bitcoin -0.63%  is an awesome historic asset, not a viable global currency. (LONG) 
2.  Bitcoin Cash -2.37%  is a sham, and worth less than the pixels of this text you are reading (0.0). (DUMP)

6.  Dash -1.10%  is the star of the show, and the reason for this chart. No other crypto is positioned in the market to scale globally as big as Dash is! (LONG)

I tried to make a good reflection of the whole cryptomarket. I only could do this with coins that been trading for more than a year. Otherwise the chart did not work. So I made a chart with the following coins: 
BTC -0.74% , ETH, XRP, LTC, DASH, NEO, MONERO,  XEM -1.35% 

If people also wanna chart on this chart use the following ticker:

About the charts 
The first chart you see is on the logic alghoritme. The second one in normal view. 

On the first alghoritme we see a big rising wedge! On the second one you see the beautifull elliot-wave pattern. The 5th wave or 3th wave up reached the 1.618 fibonacci level, the same level als the last crash.  

I think there could be an abc-correction wave. With a total retracement of the whole cryptocurrancy market of 35-55%. 

Some other information to think about. Correct me when i'm wrong! 
First crash:  
-20 june the total marketcap of cryptocurrancies was 115 million.  
-16 july the total marketcap of cryptocurrancies 67 million  

Trigger: The first  bitcoin -0.74%  fork?  

Second crash:  
-1 september the total marketcap of cryptocurrancies was 174 million.  
-15 september the total marketcap of cryptocurrancies was 109 million.  

Trigger: China Ban?  

The last and upcomming crash>  
It should be time for a correction of the total market! I think there is a huge change.  

Trigger: I really think the Tether usd hack could trigger a crash.

The bitcoin dominance is 56%. So the total marketcap of the other coins should be 44%. 

Total marketcap: 54.000.000.000 / 44% = 122.727.000.000 usd 
Bitcoin: 122.727.000.000 - 54.000.000.000 = 68.727.000.000 usd 

So the bitcoin should multiplied by 68.727.000.000 / 138.000.000.000 = 50%

Get ready to DASH when the dollar goes digital! 


Dash -1.60%  is one of my favourite altcoins with respect to crypto as a globally scalable currency instead of a flawed overbought asset or fancy network-platform disguised as a currency. 
Day trading in the ultra-short ranges along with wave traders and bandwagon enthusiasts may seem appealing to a ripoff alt coin, but when it comes to Dash, the bears may be devastated by the returns the bulls will brag about in the years to come. 

If any cryptocurrency is going to disrupt fiat forex and drop the world on its head, the chances are in favour of Dash. The only currency powerful enough to challenge Dash in a race will resemble the digital dollar, or literally be a BANKcoin/FEDcoin issued by the whales of central/retail banking. 
Gold 0.15%  and  silver -0.89%  are no longer used as a currency, or even as a backing-asset anymore. The only system on Earth hoarding  gold 0.15%  are the reserves, or industry players directly involved in the utilitarian usage of the metal. 
Backing a currency by the  gold 0.15%  standard is no longer what Planet Earth chooses to do with their matter. Fiat is now lubricating the cogs of finance and society, driving us forward into the future of money! 
Maybe even the martians understand the benefits of a digital dollar or even Dash over the illusion of metallic gold? 

My positions still remain the same from 2018 - 2020: 
Dash is basically Litecoin 2.0 and  Bitcoin -0.74%  3.0 

1.  Bitcoin -0.67%  is an awesome historic asset, not a viable global currency. (LONG) 
2.  Bitcoin Cash -2.38%  is a sham, and worth less than the pixels of this text you are reading (0.0). (DUMP) 
3.  Ethereum -0.10% may be shorted heavily in June for  BTC -0.67%  but is still a really cool network-platform! (LONG) 
4.  Litecoin -1.64%  is kind of a sham as well...Repeat the mistakes of  Bitcoin -0.74% , pump it up and hope nobody finds out before it is too late! (DUMP) 
5.  Eos -4.77%  is pretty cool as well! An innovative platform with room to grow, but not a true cryptocurrency (LONG) 
6.  Dash -1.60%  is the star of the show, and the reason for this chart. No other crypto is positioned in the market to scale globally as big as Dash is! (LONG) 

I will probably chart all of the cryptos I discussed to go into details on each, and clarify what my projections and positions are currently. 
With a future so bright and a fresh cryptocurrency ready to visit the moon, why would I want to short so early and lose out? 
If you miss out on the small pop & drop, keep tuned for market moves over the next few months. 
We live in an amazing world, and I am very excited for what tomorrow holds!

Comment:
					I also want to add that I am not paid by ANYBODY to market or shill/pitch their products. My charts are backed by where my investments are or where my head is at. 

If I make a call that a project is doomed, it is not because I want to crash the market price for revenge, or to trick others into handing me their crypto at rock-bottom prices. 

It is because I want to get a timestamp next to my ideas, to come back down the road later and see how my investments line up with the progress of the crypto industry overall. 

If someone pays me to peddle their coin to my TV followers/readers, I will make it extremely clear I have an incentive for my opinions outside of what I am already invested in.

62,1528431622.0,Procinctu,Bollinger Band Squeeze: Will Volatility pick up on DASH?,"
DASH has been fairly stagnant over the last few days. On several time frames, conditions for a  Bollinger Band  Squeeze are met. 

You can visibly see on the chart that the bands are contracting. Another thing you want to look for is the  Bollinger Band  Width. On a daily, many look for a 6 month low for the squeeze to be in play. 

As this is the 4 hour chart, the equivalent of 30 days would be about the same amount of candles as if it were a  daily chart . Interestingly, that last time the  Bollinger Band  Width was THIS low, was just before the big Crypto run up in late 2017. 

I don't know that the same kind of  volatility  from 2017 will come in just yet....but the probability is increased that some form of  volatility  can be expected...in either direction, up or down.

65,1527710414.0,Tradingstrategyguides,DASH SPIKE & LEDGE REVERSAL CRYPTO STRATEGY,"




May 30




Step #1: Dash cryptocurrency price needs to show a steady rise that suddenly accelerates to the upside. 
When this reversal pattern is complete, it will resemble a cup with a sharp bottom. 
This sharp acceleration usually is the last stage of a bull cryptocurrency market, and it’s followed by a sharp reversal if all the trading criteria for a valid Spike and Ledge are met. 
In  technical analysis , professional traders also refer to this last spike as being an exhaustion reversal bar that has a high probability of signaling a reversal in the Dash price. 
Now, before we can trade successfully, we need to understand that this key climax reversal bar needs to follow specific trading rules. 
More specifically, this exhaustion reversal bar needs to follow three rules, which we’re going to highlight next. 
Step #2: The exhaustion reversal bar needs to be bigger than the previous bar 
Relatively speaking the exhaustion bar, which should be the last bar within the downtrend, needs to be bigger than the previous bars. However, this is not mandatory. 
Ideally, the bigger the climax bar is in comparison with the other bars within the  bullish trend , the more profitable the reversal pattern becomes. 
Step #3: The climax bar needs to develop at a key sup/res level or after breaking a key swing low/high 
We can’t stress enough the importance of location in trading. 
Many times you’ll notice that a chart pattern will fail, but that’s not because that price pattern has stopped working. It’s often the case that you don’t have the patience for these patterns to develop at the right location. 
In order for the Dash cryptocurrency trading strategy to work we need to wait for the exhaustion bar to show up at the right location. 
Step #4: The exhaustion bar develops after several  bullish  impulsive bars 
We need to make sure that the exhaustion bar occurs after several  bullish  impulsive bars. 
These impulsive  bullish  bars will make the appearance of a  bullish trend  that will trap many sellers once the tide turns. And that’s how retail traders trade the markets, but to trade profitably, you need to trade against the retail mindset. 
Step #5: After the upward spike, wait for the market to enter into a short period of consolidation or channeling. 
Usually, after the Dash cryptocurrency price had that last spike up the market will take a pause to digest the recent move, and it will start moving into a short period of consolidation or channeling. 
Simply, draw two parallel lines to contain this price range. 
Now, this is what we refer to as being the “Ledge.” 
The Spike and Ledge reversal pattern satisfies all trading conditions outlined above which mean that we can move forward and describe how to sell Dash coin. 
Step #6: Sell Dash coin when we break below the Ledge 
A short trade is entered on the breakout of the Ledge. 
This is an easy entry method, but in order to avoid the short-term noise and the usual false breakouts, we need also to wait for the breakout candle to close below the Ledge. 
Step #7: Place your protective Stop Loss above the Exhaustion bar 
The initial protective stop loss is placed on the other side of the reversal pattern. 
You hide your stop loss above the exhaustion bar. 
Step #8: Your Take Profit needs to be two or three times bigger than your risk aka your stop loss. 
As a general rule, you do want your take profit to be bigger than your stop loss. This is very important to your long-term survival in this business. 
However, you can achieve your profit target goals by using your preferred strategy when it comes to exit the market. We encourage you to experiment different exit strategies and see which one yields better results. 
Note** the above was an example of a SELL trade using our favorite Dash strategy. Use the same rules for a BUY trade – but in reverse.

The price of Dash has retraced to the starting point of an impulse wave, which discards the possibility that the first upside impulse was a wave 1 from a larger degree, because if that was the case wave 2 couldn't retrace 100% as the price did. So we are seeing another corrective wave and it's likely going to be a Y wave from a WXY correction in the opposite direction from the massive  ABC  move we saw prior.

Day trading in the ultra-short ranges along with wave traders and bandwagon enthusiasts may seem appealing to a ripoff alt coin, but when it comes to Dash, the bears may be devastated by the returns the bulls will brag about in the years to come. 

If any cryptocurrency is going to disrupt fiat forex and drop the world on its head, the chances are in favour of Dash. The only currency powerful enough to challenge Dash in a race will resemble the digital dollar, or literally be a BANKcoin/FEDcoin issued by the whales of central/retail banking. 
Gold 0.16%  and  silver -0.89%  are no longer used as a currency, or even as a backing-asset anymore. The only system on Earth hoarding  gold 0.16%  are the reserves, or industry players directly involved in the utilitarian usage of the metal. 
Backing a currency by the  gold 0.16%  standard is no longer what Planet Earth chooses to do with their matter. Fiat is now lubricating the cogs of finance and society, driving us forward into the future of money! 
Maybe even the martians understand the benefits of a digital dollar or even Dash over the illusion of metallic gold? 

My positions still remain the same from 2018 - 2020: 
Dash is basically Litecoin 2.0 and  Bitcoin -0.74%  3.0 

1.  Bitcoin -0.68%  is an awesome historic asset, not a viable global currency. (LONG) 
2.  Bitcoin Cash -2.38%  is a sham, and worth less than the pixels of this text you are reading (0.0). (DUMP) 
3.  Ethereum -0.09% may be shorted heavily in June for  BTC -0.68%  but is still a really cool network-platform! (LONG) 
4.  Litecoin -1.65%  is kind of a sham as well...Repeat the mistakes of  Bitcoin -0.74% , pump it up and hope nobody finds out before it is too late! (DUMP) 
5.  Eos -4.86%  is pretty cool as well! An innovative platform with room to grow, but not a true cryptocurrency (LONG) 
6.  Dash -1.14%  is the star of the show, and the reason for this chart. No other crypto is positioned in the market to scale globally as big as Dash is! (LONG) 

I will probably chart all of the cryptos I discussed to go into details on each, and clarify what my projections and positions are currently. 
With a future so bright and a fresh cryptocurrency ready to visit the moon, why would I want to short so early and lose out? 
If you miss out on the small pop & drop, keep tuned for market moves over the next few months. 
We live in an amazing world, and I am very excited for what tomorrow holds!

80,1528431622.0,Procinctu,Bollinger Band Squeeze: Will Volatility pick up on DASH?,"
DASH has been fairly stagnant over the last few days. On several time frames, conditions for a  Bollinger Band  Squeeze are met. 

You can visibly see on the chart that the bands are contracting. Another thing you want to look for is the  Bollinger Band  Width. On a daily, many look for a 6 month low for the squeeze to be in play. 

As this is the 4 hour chart, the equivalent of 30 days would be about the same amount of candles as if it were a  daily chart . Interestingly, that last time the  Bollinger Band  Width was THIS low, was just before the big Crypto run up in late 2017. 

I don't know that the same kind of  volatility  from 2017 will come in just yet....but the probability is increased that some form of  volatility  can be expected...in either direction, up or down.

83,1527710414.0,Tradingstrategyguides,DASH SPIKE & LEDGE REVERSAL CRYPTO STRATEGY,"




May 30




Step #1: Dash cryptocurrency price needs to show a steady rise that suddenly accelerates to the upside. 
When this reversal pattern is complete, it will resemble a cup with a sharp bottom. 
This sharp acceleration usually is the last stage of a bull cryptocurrency market, and it’s followed by a sharp reversal if all the trading criteria for a valid Spike and Ledge are met. 
In  technical analysis , professional traders also refer to this last spike as being an exhaustion reversal bar that has a high probability of signaling a reversal in the Dash price. 
Now, before we can trade successfully, we need to understand that this key climax reversal bar needs to follow specific trading rules. 
More specifically, this exhaustion reversal bar needs to follow three rules, which we’re going to highlight next. 
Step #2: The exhaustion reversal bar needs to be bigger than the previous bar 
Relatively speaking the exhaustion bar, which should be the last bar within the downtrend, needs to be bigger than the previous bars. However, this is not mandatory. 
Ideally, the bigger the climax bar is in comparison with the other bars within the  bullish trend , the more profitable the reversal pattern becomes. 
Step #3: The climax bar needs to develop at a key sup/res level or after breaking a key swing low/high 
We can’t stress enough the importance of location in trading. 
Many times you’ll notice that a chart pattern will fail, but that’s not because that price pattern has stopped working. It’s often the case that you don’t have the patience for these patterns to develop at the right location. 
In order for the Dash cryptocurrency trading strategy to work we need to wait for the exhaustion bar to show up at the right location. 
Step #4: The exhaustion bar develops after several  bullish  impulsive bars 
We need to make sure that the exhaustion bar occurs after several  bullish  impulsive bars. 
These impulsive  bullish  bars will make the appearance of a  bullish trend  that will trap many sellers once the tide turns. And that’s how retail traders trade the markets, but to trade profitably, you need to trade against the retail mindset. 
Step #5: After the upward spike, wait for the market to enter into a short period of consolidation or channeling. 
Usually, after the Dash cryptocurrency price had that last spike up the market will take a pause to digest the recent move, and it will start moving into a short period of consolidation or channeling. 
Simply, draw two parallel lines to contain this price range. 
Now, this is what we refer to as being the “Ledge.” 
The Spike and Ledge reversal pattern satisfies all trading conditions outlined above which mean that we can move forward and describe how to sell Dash coin. 
Step #6: Sell Dash coin when we break below the Ledge 
A short trade is entered on the breakout of the Ledge. 
This is an easy entry method, but in order to avoid the short-term noise and the usual false breakouts, we need also to wait for the breakout candle to close below the Ledge. 
Step #7: Place your protective Stop Loss above the Exhaustion bar 
The initial protective stop loss is placed on the other side of the reversal pattern. 
You hide your stop loss above the exhaustion bar. 
Step #8: Your Take Profit needs to be two or three times bigger than your risk aka your stop loss. 
As a general rule, you do want your take profit to be bigger than your stop loss. This is very important to your long-term survival in this business. 
However, you can achieve your profit target goals by using your preferred strategy when it comes to exit the market. We encourage you to experiment different exit strategies and see which one yields better results. 
Note** the above was an example of a SELL trade using our favorite Dash strategy. Use the same rules for a BUY trade – but in reverse.

The price of Dash has retraced to the starting point of an impulse wave, which discards the possibility that the first upside impulse was a wave 1 from a larger degree, because if that was the case wave 2 couldn't retrace 100% as the price did. So we are seeing another corrective wave and it's likely going to be a Y wave from a WXY correction in the opposite direction from the massive  ABC  move we saw prior. That would all mean that another down move is coming after the Y ends on the upside.

Nov 21, 2017




I tried to make a good reflection of the whole cryptomarket. I only could do this with coins that been trading for more than a year. Otherwise the chart did not work. So I made a chart with the following coins: 
BTC -0.74% , ETH, XRP, LTC, DASH, NEO, MONERO,  XEM -1.35% 

If people also wanna chart on this chart use the following ticker: 
COINBASE:BTCUSD*16692550+BITFINEX:ETHUSD*92862174+BITTREX:XRPUSD*38622892459+BITFINEX:LTCUSD*53927233+BITTREX:DASHUSD*7701656+BITTREX:NEOUSD*65000000+BITTREX:XMRUSD*15377976+BITTREX:XEMUSD*8999999999 

About the charts 
The first chart you see is on the logic alghoritme. The second one in normal view. 

On the first alghoritme we see a big rising wedge! On the second one you see the beautifull elliot-wave pattern. The 5th wave or 3th wave up reached the 1.618 fibonacci level, the same level als the last crash.  

I think there could be an abc-correction wave. With a total retracement of the whole cryptocurrancy market of 35-55%. 

Some other information to think about. Correct me when i'm wrong! 
First crash:  
-20 june the total marketcap of cryptocurrancies was 115 million.  
-16 july the total marketcap of cryptocurrancies 67 million  

Trigger: The first  bitcoin -0.74%  fork?  

Second crash:  
-1 september the total marketcap of cryptocurrancies was 174 million.  
-15 september the total marketcap of cryptocurrancies was 109 million.  

Trigger: China Ban?  

The last and upcomming crash>  
It should be time for a correction of the total market! I think there is a huge change.  

Trigger: I really think the Tether usd hack could trigger a crash.  

Last thing I want to say, I try to do an objective view. I believe it will happen. You don't have to agree with me, take your own conclusion!

The bitcoin dominance is 56%. So the total marketcap of the other coins should be 44%. 

Total marketcap: 54.000.000.000 / 44% = 122.727.000.000 usd 
Bitcoin: 122.727.000.000 - 54.000.000.000 = 68.727.000.000 usd 

So the bitcoin should multiplied by 68.727.000.000 / 138.000.000.000 = 50%

Technical analysis: 
DASH/DOLLAR is in a range bound and beginning of up trend is expected.  
The price is below the 21-Day WEMA which acts as a dynamic resistance.  
The  RSI  is at 47.  

Trading suggestion: 
The price is in a range bound, but we forecast the uptrend would begin.  
There is possibility of temporary retracement to suggested  support zone  (417 to 281), if so, traders can set orders based on Daily-Trading-Opportunities and expect to reach short-term targets.  

Beginning of entry zone (417)  
Ending of entry zone (281)  

Entry signal: 
Signal to enter the market occurs when the price comes to ""Buy zone"" then forms one of the reversal patterns, whether ""Bullish Engulfing"", ""Hammer"" or ""Valley"", in other words,  
NO entry signal when the price comes to the zone BUT after any of reversal patterns is formed in the zone.

Total marketcap: 54.000.000.000 / 44% = 122.727.000.000 usd 
Bitcoin: 122.727.000.000 - 54.000.000.000 = 68.727.000.000 usd

Get ready to DASH when the dollar goes digital! 


Dash -1.60%  is one of my favourite altcoins with respect to crypto as a globally scalable currency instead of a flawed overbought asset or fancy network-platform disguised as a currency. 
Day trading in the ultra-short ranges along with wave traders and bandwagon enthusiasts may seem appealing to a ripoff alt coin, but when it comes to Dash, the bears may be devastated by the returns the bulls will brag about in the years to come. 

If any cryptocurrency is going to disrupt fiat forex and drop the world on its head, the chances are in favour of Dash. The only currency powerful enough to challenge Dash in a race will resemble the digital dollar, or literally be a BANKcoin/FEDcoin issued by the whales of central/retail banking. 
Gold 0.15%  and  silver -0.89%  are no longer used as a currency, or even as a backing-asset anymore. The only system on Earth hoarding  gold 0.15%  are the reserves, or industry players directly involved in the utilitarian usage of the metal. 
Backing a currency by the  gold 0.15%  standard is no longer what Planet Earth chooses to do with their matter. Fiat is now lubricating the cogs of finance and society, driving us forward into the future of money! 
Maybe even the martians understand the benefits of a digital dollar or even Dash over the illusion of metallic gold? 

My positions still remain the same from 2018 - 2020: 
Dash is basically Litecoin 2.0 and  Bitcoin -0.74%  3.0 

1.  Bitcoin -0.65%  is an awesome historic asset, not a viable global currency. (LONG) 
2.  Bitcoin Cash -2.40%  is a sham, and worth less than the pixels of this text you are reading (0.0). (DUMP) 
3.  Ethereum -0.12% may be shorted heavily in June for  BTC -0.65%  but is still a really cool network-platform! (LONG) 
4.  Litecoin -1.73%  is kind of a sham as well...Repeat the mistakes of  Bitcoin -0.74% , pump it up and hope nobody finds out before it is too late! (DUMP) 
5.  Eos -5.02%  is pretty cool as well! An innovative platform with room to grow, but not a true cryptocurrency (LONG) 
6.  Dash -1.60%  is the star of the show, and the reason for this chart. No other crypto is positioned in the market to scale globally as big as Dash is! (LONG) 

I will probably chart all of the cryptos I discussed to go into details on each, and clarify what my projections and positions are currently. 
With a future so bright and a fresh cryptocurrency ready to visit the moon, why would I want to short so early and lose out? 
If you miss out on the small pop & drop, keep tuned for market moves over the next few months. 
We live in an amazing world, and I am very excited for what tomorrow holds!

Comment:
					I also want to add that I am not paid by ANYBODY to market or shill/pitch their products. My charts are backed by where my investments are or where my head is at. 

If I make a call that a project is doomed, it is not because I want to crash the market price for revenge, or to trick others into handing me their crypto at rock-bottom prices. 

It is because I want to get a timestamp next to my ideas, to come back down the road later and see how my investments line up with the progress of the crypto industry overall. 

If someone pays me to peddle their coin to my TV followers/readers, I will make it extremely clear I have an incentive for my opinions outside of what I am already invested in.

116,1528431622.0,Procinctu,Bollinger Band Squeeze: Will Volatility pick up on DASH?,"
DASH has been fairly stagnant over the last few days. On several time frames, conditions for a  Bollinger Band  Squeeze are met. 

You can visibly see on the chart that the bands are contracting. Another thing you want to look for is the  Bollinger Band  Width. On a daily, many look for a 6 month low for the squeeze to be in play. 

As this is the 4 hour chart, the equivalent of 30 days would be about the same amount of candles as if it were a  daily chart . Interestingly, that last time the  Bollinger Band  Width was THIS low, was just before the big Crypto run up in late 2017. 

I don't know that the same kind of  volatility  from 2017 will come in just yet....but the probability is increased that some form of  volatility  can be expected...in either direction, up or down.

119,1527710414.0,Tradingstrategyguides,DASH SPIKE & LEDGE REVERSAL CRYPTO STRATEGY,"




May 30




Step #1: Dash cryptocurrency price needs to show a steady rise that suddenly accelerates to the upside. 
When this reversal pattern is complete, it will resemble a cup with a sharp bottom. 
This sharp acceleration usually is the last stage of a bull cryptocurrency market, and it’s followed by a sharp reversal if all the trading criteria for a valid Spike and Ledge are met. 
In  technical analysis , professional traders also refer to this last spike as being an exhaustion reversal bar that has a high probability of signaling a reversal in the Dash price. 
Now, before we can trade successfully, we need to understand that this key climax reversal bar needs to follow specific trading rules. 
More specifically, this exhaustion reversal bar needs to follow three rules, which we’re going to highlight next. 
Step #2: The exhaustion reversal bar needs to be bigger than the previous bar 
Relatively speaking the exhaustion bar, which should be the last bar within the downtrend, needs to be bigger than the previous bars. However, this is not mandatory. 
Ideally, the bigger the climax bar is in comparison with the other bars within the  bullish trend , the more profitable the reversal pattern becomes. 
Step #3: The climax bar needs to develop at a key sup/res level or after breaking a key swing low/high 
We can’t stress enough the importance of location in trading. 
Many times you’ll notice that a chart pattern will fail, but that’s not because that price pattern has stopped working. It’s often the case that you don’t have the patience for these patterns to develop at the right location. 
In order for the Dash cryptocurrency trading strategy to work we need to wait for the exhaustion bar to show up at the right location. 
Step #4: The exhaustion bar develops after several  bullish  impulsive bars 
We need to make sure that the exhaustion bar occurs after several  bullish  impulsive bars. 
These impulsive  bullish  bars will make the appearance of a  bullish trend  that will trap many sellers once the tide turns. And that’s how retail traders trade the markets, but to trade profitably, you need to trade against the retail mindset. 
Step #5: After the upward spike, wait for the market to enter into a short period of consolidation or channeling. 
Usually, after the Dash cryptocurrency price had that last spike up the market will take a pause to digest the recent move, and it will start moving into a short period of consolidation or channeling. 
Simply, draw two parallel lines to contain this price range. 
Now, this is what we refer to as being the “Ledge.” 
The Spike and Ledge reversal pattern satisfies all trading conditions outlined above which mean that we can move forward and describe how to sell Dash coin. 
Step #6: Sell Dash coin when we break below the Ledge 
A short trade is entered on the breakout of the Ledge. 
This is an easy entry method, but in order to avoid the short-term noise and the usual false breakouts, we need also to wait for the breakout candle to close below the Ledge. 
Step #7: Place your protective Stop Loss above the Exhaustion bar 
The initial protective stop loss is placed on the other side of the reversal pattern. 
You hide your stop loss above the exhaustion bar. 
Step #8: Your Take Profit needs to be two or three times bigger than your risk aka your stop loss. 
As a general rule, you do want your take profit to be bigger than your stop loss. This is very important to your long-term survival in this business. 
However, you can achieve your profit target goals by using your preferred strategy when it comes to exit the market. We encourage you to experiment different exit strategies and see which one yields better results. 
Note** the above was an example of a SELL trade using our favorite Dash strategy. Use the same rules for a BUY trade – but in reverse.

Get ready to DASH when the dollar goes digital! 


Dash -1.60%  is one of my favourite altcoins with respect to crypto as a globally scalable currency instead of a flawed overbought asset or fancy network-platform disguised as a currency. 
Day trading in the ultra-short ranges along with wave traders and bandwagon enthusiasts may seem appealing to a ripoff alt coin, but when it comes to Dash, the bears may be devastated by the returns the bulls will brag about in the years to come. 

If any cryptocurrency is going to disrupt fiat forex and drop the world on its head, the chances are in favour of Dash. The only currency powerful enough to challenge Dash in a race will resemble the digital dollar, or literally be a BANKcoin/FEDcoin issued by the whales of central/retail banking. 
Gold 0.15%  and  silver -0.89%  are no longer used as a currency, or even as a backing-asset anymore. The only system on Earth hoarding  gold 0.15%  are the reserves, or industry players directly involved in the utilitarian usage of the metal. 
Backing a currency by the  gold 0.15%  standard is no longer what Planet Earth chooses to do with their matter. Fiat is now lubricating the cogs of finance and society, driving us forward into the future of money! 
Maybe even the martians understand the benefits of a digital dollar or even Dash over the illusion of metallic gold? 

My positions still remain the same from 2018 - 2020: 
Dash is basically Litecoin 2.0 and  Bitcoin -0.73%  3.0 

1.  Bitcoin -0.62%  is an awesome historic asset, not a viable global currency. (LONG)

3.  Ethereum -0.09% may be shorted heavily in June for  BTC -0.62%  but is still a really cool network-platform! (LONG)

5.  Eos -4.90%  is pretty cool as well! An innovative platform with room to grow, but not a true cryptocurrency (LONG) 
6.  Dash -1.60%  is the star of the show, and the reason for this chart. No other crypto is positioned in the market to scale globally as big as Dash is! (LONG) 

I will probably chart all of the cryptos I discussed to go into details on each, and clarify what my projections and positions are currently. 
With a future so bright and a fresh cryptocurrency ready to visit the moon, why would I want to short so early and lose out? 
If you miss out on the small pop & drop, keep tuned for market moves over the next few months.

May 30




Step #1: Dash cryptocurrency price needs to show a steady rise that suddenly accelerates to the upside. 
When this reversal pattern is complete, it will resemble a cup with a sharp bottom. 
This sharp acceleration usually is the last stage of a bull cryptocurrency market, and it’s followed by a sharp reversal if all the trading criteria for a valid Spike and Ledge are met. 
In  technical analysis , professional traders also refer to this last spike as being an exhaustion reversal bar that has a high probability of signaling a reversal in the Dash price. 
Now, before we can trade successfully, we need to understand that this key climax reversal bar needs to follow specific trading rules. 
More specifically, this exhaustion reversal bar needs to follow three rules, which we’re going to highlight next. 
Step #2: The exhaustion reversal bar needs to be bigger than the previous bar 
Relatively speaking the exhaustion bar, which should be the last bar within the downtrend, needs to be bigger than the previous bars. However, this is not mandatory. 
Ideally, the bigger the climax bar is in comparison with the other bars within the  bullish trend , the more profitable the reversal pattern becomes. 
Step #3: The climax bar needs to develop at a key sup/res level or after breaking a key swing low/high 
We can’t stress enough the importance of location in trading. 
Many times you’ll notice that a chart pattern will fail, but that’s not because that price pattern has stopped working. It’s often the case that you don’t have the patience for these patterns to develop at the right location. 
In order for the Dash cryptocurrency trading strategy to work we need to wait for the exhaustion bar to show up at the right location. 
Step #4: The exhaustion bar develops after several  bullish  impulsive bars 
We need to make sure that the exhaustion bar occurs after several  bullish  impulsive bars. 
These impulsive  bullish  bars will make the appearance of a  bullish trend  that will trap many sellers once the tide turns. And that’s how retail traders trade the markets, but to trade profitably, you need to trade against the retail mindset. 
Step #5: After the upward spike, wait for the market to enter into a short period of consolidation or channeling. 
Usually, after the Dash cryptocurrency price had that last spike up the market will take a pause to digest the recent move, and it will start moving into a short period of consolidation or channeling. 
Simply, draw two parallel lines to contain this price range. 
Now, this is what we refer to as being the “Ledge.” 
The Spike and Ledge reversal pattern satisfies all trading conditions outlined above which mean that we can move forward and describe how to sell Dash coin. 
Step #6: Sell Dash coin when we break below the Ledge 
A short trade is entered on the breakout of the Ledge. 
This is an easy entry method, but in order to avoid the short-term noise and the usual false breakouts, we need also to wait for the breakout candle to close below the Ledge. 
Step #7: Place your protective Stop Loss above the Exhaustion bar 
The initial protective stop loss is placed on the other side of the reversal pattern. 
You hide your stop loss above the exhaustion bar. 
Step #8: Your Take Profit needs to be two or three times bigger than your risk aka your stop loss. 
As a general rule, you do want your take profit to be bigger than your stop loss. This is very important to your long-term survival in this business. 
However, you can achieve your profit target goals by using your preferred strategy when it comes to exit the market. We encourage you to experiment different exit strategies and see which one yields better results. 
Note** the above was an example of a SELL trade using our favorite Dash strategy. Use the same rules for a BUY trade – but in reverse.  
PM me if you want to read the complete strategy

The price of Dash has retraced to the starting point of an impulse wave, which discards the possibility that the first upside impulse was a wave 1 from a larger degree, because if that was the case wave 2 couldn't retrace 100% as the price did. So we are seeing another corrective wave and it's likely going to be a Y wave from a WXY correction in the opposite direction from the massive  ABC  move we saw prior. That would all mean that another down move is coming after the Y ends on the upside.

Nov 21, 2017




I tried to make a good reflection of the whole cryptomarket. I only could do this with coins that been trading for more than a year. Otherwise the chart did not work. So I made a chart with the following coins: 
BTC -0.74% , ETH, XRP, LTC, DASH, NEO, MONERO,  XEM -1.35% 

If people also wanna chart on this chart use the following ticker: 
COINBASE:BTCUSD*16692550+BITFINEX:ETHUSD*92862174+BITTREX:XRPUSD*38622892459+BITFINEX:LTCUSD*53927233+BITTREX:DASHUSD*7701656+BITTREX:NEOUSD*65000000+BITTREX:XMRUSD*15377976+BITTREX:XEMUSD*8999999999 

About the charts 
The first chart you see is on the logic alghoritme. The second one in normal view. 

On the first alghoritme we see a big rising wedge! On the second one you see the beautifull elliot-wave pattern. The 5th wave or 3th wave up reached the 1.618 fibonacci level, the same level als the last crash.  

I think there could be an abc-correction wave. With a total retracement of the whole cryptocurrancy market of 35-55%. 

Some other information to think about. Correct me when i'm wrong! 
First crash:  
-20 june the total marketcap of cryptocurrancies was 115 million.  
-16 july the total marketcap of cryptocurrancies 67 million  

Trigger: The first  bitcoin -0.74%  fork?  

Second crash:  
-1 september the total marketcap of cryptocurrancies was 174 million.  
-15 september the total marketcap of cryptocurrancies was 109 million.  

Trigger: China Ban?  

The last and upcomming crash>  
It should be time for a correction of the total market! I think there is a huge change.  

Trigger: I really think the Tether usd hack could trigger a crash.  

Last thing I want to say, I try to do an objective view. I believe it will happen. You don't have to agree with me, take your own conclusion!

Total except bitcoin: 54.000.000.000 usd 

The bitcoin dominance is 56%. So the total marketcap of the other coins should be 44%. 

Total marketcap: 54.000.000.000 / 44% = 122.727.000.000 usd 
Bitcoin: 122.727.000.000 - 54.000.000.000 = 68.727.000.000 usd 

So the bitcoin should multiplied by 68.727.000.000 / 138.000.000.000 = 50%

Technical analysis: 
DASH/DOLLAR is in a range bound and beginning of up trend is expected.  
The price is below the 21-Day WEMA which acts as a dynamic resistance.  
The  RSI  is at 47.  

Trading suggestion: 
The price is in a range bound, but we forecast the uptrend would begin.  
There is possibility of temporary retracement to suggested  support zone  (417 to 281), if so, traders can set orders based on Daily-Trading-Opportunities and expect to reach short-term targets.  

Beginning of entry zone (417)  
Ending of entry zone (281)  

Entry signal: 
Signal to enter the market occurs when the price comes to ""Buy zone"" then forms one of the reversal patterns, whether ""Bullish Engulfing"", ""Hammer"" or ""Valley"", in other words,  
NO entry signal when the price comes to the zone BUT after any of reversal patterns is formed in the zone.

Usually, after the Dash cryptocurrency price had that last spike up the market will take a pause to digest the recent move, and it will start moving into a short period of consolidation or channeling. 
Simply, draw two parallel lines to contain this price range. 
Now, this is what we refer to as being the “Ledge.” 
The Spike and Ledge reversal pattern satisfies all trading conditions outlined above which mean that we can move forward and describe how to sell Dash coin. 
Step #6: Sell Dash coin when we break below the Ledge 
A short trade is entered on the breakout of the Ledge. 
This is an easy entry method, but in order to avoid the short-term noise and the usual false breakouts, we need also to wait for the breakout candle to close below the Ledge. 
Step #7: Place your protective Stop Loss above the Exhaustion bar 
The initial protective stop loss is placed on the other side of the reversal pattern. 
You hide your stop loss above the exhaustion bar. 
Step #8: Your Take Profit needs to be two or three times bigger than your risk aka your stop loss. 
As a general rule, you do want your take profit to be bigger than your stop loss. This is very important to your long-term survival in this business. 
However, you can achieve your profit target goals by using your preferred strategy when it comes to exit the market. We encourage you to experiment different exit strategies and see which one yields better results. 
Note** the above was an example of a SELL trade using our favorite Dash strategy. Use the same rules for a BUY trade – but in reverse.

Total marketcap: 54.000.000.000 / 44% = 122.727.000.000 usd 
Bitcoin: 122.727.000.000 - 54.000.000.000 = 68.727.000.000 usd

Technical analysis: 
DASH/DOLLAR is in a range bound and beginning of up trend is expected.  
The price is below the 21-Day WEMA which acts as a dynamic resistance.  
The  RSI  is at 47.  

Trading suggestion: 
The price is in a range bound, but we forecast the uptrend would begin.  
There is possibility of temporary retracement to suggested  support zone  (417 to 281), if so, traders can set orders based on Daily-Trading-Opportunities and expect to reach short-term targets.  

Beginning of entry zone (417)  
Ending of entry zone (281)  

Entry signal: 
Signal to enter the market occurs when the price comes to ""Buy zone"" then forms one of the reversal patterns, whether ""Bullish Engulfing"", ""Hammer"" or ""Valley"", in other words,  
NO entry signal when the price comes to the zone BUT after any of reversal patterns is formed in the zone.

May 27




Get ready to DASH when the dollar goes digital! 


Dash -1.84%  is one of my favourite altcoins with respect to crypto as a globally scalable currency instead of a flawed overbought asset or fancy network-platform disguised as a currency. 
Day trading in the ultra-short ranges along with wave traders and bandwagon enthusiasts may seem appealing to a ripoff alt coin, but when it comes to Dash, the bears may be devastated by the returns the bulls will brag about in the years to come. 

If any cryptocurrency is going to disrupt fiat forex and drop the world on its head, the chances are in favour of Dash. The only currency powerful enough to challenge Dash in a race will resemble the digital dollar, or literally be a BANKcoin/FEDcoin issued by the whales of central/retail banking. 
Gold 0.13%  and  silver -1.06%  are no longer used as a currency, or even as a backing-asset anymore. The only system on Earth hoarding  gold 0.13%  are the reserves, or industry players directly involved in the utilitarian usage of the metal. 
Backing a currency by the  gold 0.13%  standard is no longer what Planet Earth chooses to do with their matter. Fiat is now lubricating the cogs of finance and society, driving us forward into the future of money! 
Maybe even the martians understand the benefits of a digital dollar or even Dash over the illusion of metallic gold? 

My positions still remain the same from 2018 - 2020: 
Dash is basically Litecoin 2.0 and  Bitcoin -0.74%  3.0 

1.  Bitcoin -0.65%  is an awesome historic asset, not a viable global currency. (LONG) 
2.  Bitcoin Cash -2.61%  is a sham, and worth less than the pixels of this text you are reading (0.0). (DUMP) 
3.  Ethereum -0.08% may be shorted heavily in June for  BTC -0.65%  but is still a really cool network-platform! (LONG) 
4.  Litecoin -1.65%  is kind of a sham as well...Repeat the mistakes of  Bitcoin -0.74% , pump it up and hope nobody finds out before it is too late! (DUMP) 
5.  Eos -4.81%  is pretty cool as well! An innovative platform with room to grow, but not a true cryptocurrency (LONG) 
6.  Dash -1.84%  is the star of the show, and the reason for this chart. No other crypto is positioned in the market to scale globally as big as Dash is! (LONG) 

I will probably chart all of the cryptos I discussed to go into details on each, and clarify what my projections and positions are currently. 
With a future so bright and a fresh cryptocurrency ready to visit the moon, why would I want to short so early and lose out? 
If you miss out on the small pop & drop, keep tuned for market moves over the next few months. 
We live in an amazing world, and I am very excited for what tomorrow holds!

Comment:
					I also want to add that I am not paid by ANYBODY to market or shill/pitch their products. My charts are backed by where my investments are or where my head is at. 

If I make a call that a project is doomed, it is not because I want to crash the market price for revenge, or to trick others into handing me their crypto at rock-bottom prices. 

It is because I want to get a timestamp next to my ideas, to come back down the road later and see how my investments line up with the progress of the crypto industry overall. 

If someone pays me to peddle their coin to my TV followers/readers, I will make it extremely clear I have an incentive for my opinions outside of what I am already invested in.

170,1528431622.0,Procinctu,Bollinger Band Squeeze: Will Volatility pick up on DASH?,"
DASH has been fairly stagnant over the last few days. On several time frames, conditions for a  Bollinger Band  Squeeze are met. 

You can visibly see on the chart that the bands are contracting. Another thing you want to look for is the  Bollinger Band  Width. On a daily, many look for a 6 month low for the squeeze to be in play. 

As this is the 4 hour chart, the equivalent of 30 days would be about the same amount of candles as if it were a  daily chart . Interestingly, that last time the  Bollinger Band  Width was THIS low, was just before the big Crypto run up in late 2017. 

I don't know that the same kind of  volatility  from 2017 will come in just yet....but the probability is increased that some form of  volatility  can be expected...in either direction, up or down.

173,1527710414.0,Tradingstrategyguides,DASH SPIKE & LEDGE REVERSAL CRYPTO STRATEGY,"




May 30




Step #1: Dash cryptocurrency price needs to show a steady rise that suddenly accelerates to the upside. 
When this reversal pattern is complete, it will resemble a cup with a sharp bottom. 
This sharp acceleration usually is the last stage of a bull cryptocurrency market, and it’s followed by a sharp reversal if all the trading criteria for a valid Spike and Ledge are met. 
In  technical analysis , professional traders also refer to this last spike as being an exhaustion reversal bar that has a high probability of signaling a reversal in the Dash price. 
Now, before we can trade successfully, we need to understand that this key climax reversal bar needs to follow specific trading rules. 
More specifically, this exhaustion reversal bar needs to follow three rules, which we’re going to highlight next. 
Step #2: The exhaustion reversal bar needs to be bigger than the previous bar 
Relatively speaking the exhaustion bar, which should be the last bar within the downtrend, needs to be bigger than the previous bars. However, this is not mandatory. 
Ideally, the bigger the climax bar is in comparison with the other bars within the  bullish trend , the more profitable the reversal pattern becomes. 
Step #3: The climax bar needs to develop at a key sup/res level or after breaking a key swing low/high 
We can’t stress enough the importance of location in trading. 
Many times you’ll notice that a chart pattern will fail, but that’s not because that price pattern has stopped working. It’s often the case that you don’t have the patience for these patterns to develop at the right location. 
In order for the Dash cryptocurrency trading strategy to work we need to wait for the exhaustion bar to show up at the right location. 
Step #4: The exhaustion bar develops after several  bullish  impulsive bars 
We need to make sure that the exhaustion bar occurs after several  bullish  impulsive bars. 
These impulsive  bullish  bars will make the appearance of a  bullish trend  that will trap many sellers once the tide turns. And that’s how retail traders trade the markets, but to trade profitably, you need to trade against the retail mindset. 
Step #5: After the upward spike, wait for the market to enter into a short period of consolidation or channeling. 
Usually, after the Dash cryptocurrency price had that last spike up the market will take a pause to digest the recent move, and it will start moving into a short period of consolidation or channeling. 
Simply, draw two parallel lines to contain this price range. 
Now, this is what we refer to as being the “Ledge.” 
The Spike and Ledge reversal pattern satisfies all trading conditions outlined above which mean that we can move forward and describe how to sell Dash coin. 
Step #6: Sell Dash coin when we break below the Ledge 
A short trade is entered on the breakout of the Ledge. 
This is an easy entry method, but in order to avoid the short-term noise and the usual false breakouts, we need also to wait for the breakout candle to close below the Ledge. 
Step #7: Place your protective Stop Loss above the Exhaustion bar 
The initial protective stop loss is placed on the other side of the reversal pattern. 
You hide your stop loss above the exhaustion bar. 
Step #8: Your Take Profit needs to be two or three times bigger than your risk aka your stop loss. 
As a general rule, you do want your take profit to be bigger than your stop loss. This is very important to your long-term survival in this business. 
However, you can achieve your profit target goals by using your preferred strategy when it comes to exit the market. We encourage you to experiment different exit strategies and see which one yields better results.

Get ready to DASH when the dollar goes digital! 


Dash -1.70%  is one of my favourite altcoins with respect to crypto as a globally scalable currency instead of a flawed overbought asset or fancy network-platform disguised as a currency. 
Day trading in the ultra-short ranges along with wave traders and bandwagon enthusiasts may seem appealing to a ripoff alt coin, but when it comes to Dash, the bears may be devastated by the returns the bulls will brag about in the years to come. 

If any cryptocurrency is going to disrupt fiat forex and drop the world on its head, the chances are in favour of Dash. The only currency powerful enough to challenge Dash in a race will resemble the digital dollar, or literally be a BANKcoin/FEDcoin issued by the whales of central/retail banking. 
Gold 0.14%  and  silver -0.89%  are no longer used as a currency, or even as a backing-asset anymore. The only system on Earth hoarding  gold 0.14%  are the reserves, or industry players directly involved in the utilitarian usage of the metal. 
Backing a currency by the  gold 0.14%  standard is no longer what Planet Earth chooses to do with their matter. Fiat is now lubricating the cogs of finance and society, driving us forward into the future of money! 
Maybe even the martians understand the benefits of a digital dollar or even Dash over the illusion of metallic gold? 

My positions still remain the same from 2018 - 2020: 
Dash is basically Litecoin 2.0 and  Bitcoin -0.74%  3.0 

1.  Bitcoin -0.61%  is an awesome historic asset, not a viable global currency. (LONG) 
2.  Bitcoin Cash -2.61%  is a sham, and worth less than the pixels of this text you are reading (0.0). (DUMP) 
3.  Ethereum -0.08% may be shorted heavily in June for  BTC -0.61%  but is still a really cool network-platform! (LONG)

6.  Dash -1.70%  is the star of the show, and the reason for this chart. No other crypto is positioned in the market to scale globally as big as Dash is! (LONG) 

I will probably chart all of the cryptos I discussed to go into details on each, and clarify what my projections and positions are currently. 
With a future so bright and a fresh cryptocurrency ready to visit the moon, why would I want to short so early and lose out? 
If you miss out on the small pop & drop, keep tuned for market moves over the next few months.

May 30




Step #1: Dash cryptocurrency price needs to show a steady rise that suddenly accelerates to the upside. 
When this reversal pattern is complete, it will resemble a cup with a sharp bottom. 
This sharp acceleration usually is the last stage of a bull cryptocurrency market, and it’s followed by a sharp reversal if all the trading criteria for a valid Spike and Ledge are met. 
In  technical analysis , professional traders also refer to this last spike as being an exhaustion reversal bar that has a high probability of signaling a reversal in the Dash price. 
Now, before we can trade successfully, we need to understand that this key climax reversal bar needs to follow specific trading rules. 
More specifically, this exhaustion reversal bar needs to follow three rules, which we’re going to highlight next. 
Step #2: The exhaustion reversal bar needs to be bigger than the previous bar 
Relatively speaking the exhaustion bar, which should be the last bar within the downtrend, needs to be bigger than the previous bars. However, this is not mandatory. 
Ideally, the bigger the climax bar is in comparison with the other bars within the  bullish trend , the more profitable the reversal pattern becomes. 
Step #3: The climax bar needs to develop at a key sup/res level or after breaking a key swing low/high 
We can’t stress enough the importance of location in trading. 
Many times you’ll notice that a chart pattern will fail, but that’s not because that price pattern has stopped working. It’s often the case that you don’t have the patience for these patterns to develop at the right location. 
In order for the Dash cryptocurrency trading strategy to work we need to wait for the exhaustion bar to show up at the right location. 
Step #4: The exhaustion bar develops after several  bullish  impulsive bars 
We need to make sure that the exhaustion bar occurs after several  bullish  impulsive bars. 
These impulsive  bullish  bars will make the appearance of a  bullish trend  that will trap many sellers once the tide turns. And that’s how retail traders trade the markets, but to trade profitably, you need to trade against the retail mindset. 
Step #5: After the upward spike, wait for the market to enter into a short period of consolidation or channeling. 
Usually, after the Dash cryptocurrency price had that last spike up the market will take a pause to digest the recent move, and it will start moving into a short period of consolidation or channeling. 
Simply, draw two parallel lines to contain this price range. 
Now, this is what we refer to as being the “Ledge.” 
The Spike and Ledge reversal pattern satisfies all trading conditions outlined above which mean that we can move forward and describe how to sell Dash coin. 
Step #6: Sell Dash coin when we break below the Ledge 
A short trade is entered on the breakout of the Ledge. 
This is an easy entry method, but in order to avoid the short-term noise and the usual false breakouts, we need also to wait for the breakout candle to close below the Ledge. 
Step #7: Place your protective Stop Loss above the Exhaustion bar 
The initial protective stop loss is placed on the other side of the reversal pattern. 
You hide your stop loss above the exhaustion bar. 
Step #8: Your Take Profit needs to be two or three times bigger than your risk aka your stop loss. 
As a general rule, you do want your take profit to be bigger than your stop loss. This is very important to your long-term survival in this business. 
However, you can achieve your profit target goals by using your preferred strategy when it comes to exit the market. We encourage you to experiment different exit strategies and see which one yields better results. 
Note** the above was an example of a SELL trade using our favorite Dash strategy. Use the same rules for a BUY trade – but in reverse.

193,1528131496.0,FX_Academy,Dash (DASH/USD) still in a correction ,"
The price of Dash has retraced to the starting point of an impulse wave, which discards the possibility that the first upside impulse was a wave 1 from a larger degree, because if that was the case wave 2 couldn't retrace 100% as the price did. So we are seeing another corrective wave and it's likely going to be a Y wave from a WXY correction in the opposite direction from the massive  ABC  move we saw prior. That would all mean that another down move is coming after the Y ends on the upside.

Nov 21, 2017




I tried to make a good reflection of the whole cryptomarket. I only could do this with coins that been trading for more than a year. Otherwise the chart did not work. So I made a chart with the following coins: 
BTC -0.73% , ETH, XRP, LTC, DASH, NEO, MONERO,  XEM -1.35% 

If people also wanna chart on this chart use the following ticker: 
COINBASE:BTCUSD*16692550+BITFINEX:ETHUSD*92862174+BITTREX:XRPUSD*38622892459+BITFINEX:LTCUSD*53927233+BITTREX:DASHUSD*7701656+BITTREX:NEOUSD*65000000+BITTREX:XMRUSD*15377976+BITTREX:XEMUSD*8999999999 

About the charts 
The first chart you see is on the logic alghoritme. The second one in normal view. 

On the first alghoritme we see a big rising wedge! On the second one you see the beautifull elliot-wave pattern. The 5th wave or 3th wave up reached the 1.618 fibonacci level, the same level als the last crash.  

I think there could be an abc-correction wave. With a total retracement of the whole cryptocurrancy market of 35-55%. 

Some other information to think about. Correct me when i'm wrong! 
First crash:  
-20 june the total marketcap of cryptocurrancies was 115 million.  
-16 july the total marketcap of cryptocurrancies 67 million  

Trigger: The first  bitcoin -0.73%  fork?  

Second crash:  
-1 september the total marketcap of cryptocurrancies was 174 million.  
-15 september the total marketcap of cryptocurrancies was 109 million.  

Trigger: China Ban?  

The last and upcomming crash>  
It should be time for a correction of the total market! I think there is a huge change.  

Trigger: I really think the Tether usd hack could trigger a crash.  

Last thing I want to say, I try to do an objective view. I believe it will happen. You don't have to agree with me, take your own conclusion!

The bitcoin dominance is 56%. So the total marketcap of the other coins should be 44%. 

Total marketcap: 54.000.000.000 / 44% = 122.727.000.000 usd 
Bitcoin: 122.727.000.000 - 54.000.000.000 = 68.727.000.000 usd 

So the bitcoin should multiplied by 68.727.000.000 / 138.000.000.000 = 50%

In  technical analysis , professional traders also refer to this last spike as being an exhaustion reversal bar that has a high probability of signaling a reversal in the Dash price. 
Now, before we can trade successfully, we need to understand that this key climax reversal bar needs to follow specific trading rules. 
More specifically, this exhaustion reversal bar needs to follow three rules, which we’re going to highlight next. 
Step #2: The exhaustion reversal bar needs to be bigger than the previous bar 
Relatively speaking the exhaustion bar, which should be the last bar within the downtrend, needs to be bigger than the previous bars. However, this is not mandatory. 
Ideally, the bigger the climax bar is in comparison with the other bars within the  bullish trend , the more profitable the reversal pattern becomes. 
Step #3: The climax bar needs to develop at a key sup/res level or after breaking a key swing low/high 
We can’t stress enough the importance of location in trading. 
Many times you’ll notice that a chart pattern will fail, but that’s not because that price pattern has stopped working. It’s often the case that you don’t have the patience for these patterns to develop at the right location. 
In order for the Dash cryptocurrency trading strategy to work we need to wait for the exhaustion bar to show up at the right location. 
Step #4: The exhaustion bar develops after several  bullish  impulsive bars 
We need to make sure that the exhaustion bar occurs after several  bullish  impulsive bars. 
These impulsive  bullish  bars will make the appearance of a  bullish trend  that will trap many sellers once the tide turns. And that’s how retail traders trade the markets, but to trade profitably, you need to trade against the retail mindset. 
Step #5: After the upward spike, wait for the market to enter into a short period of consolidation or channeling. 
Usually, after the Dash cryptocurrency price had that last spike up the market will take a pause to digest the recent move, and it will start moving into a short period of consolidation or channeling. 
Simply, draw two parallel lines to contain this price range. 
Now, this is what we refer to as being the “Ledge.” 
The Spike and Ledge reversal pattern satisfies all trading conditions outlined above which mean that we can move forward and describe how to sell Dash coin. 
Step #6: Sell Dash coin when we break below the Ledge 
A short trade is entered on the breakout of the Ledge. 
This is an easy entry method, but in order to avoid the short-term noise and the usual false breakouts, we need also to wait for the breakout candle to close below the Ledge. 
Step #7: Place your protective Stop Loss above the Exhaustion bar 
The initial protective stop loss is placed on the other side of the reversal pattern. 
You hide your stop loss above the exhaustion bar. 
Step #8: Your Take Profit needs to be two or three times bigger than your risk aka your stop loss. 
As a general rule, you do want your take profit to be bigger than your stop loss. This is very important to your long-term survival in this business. 
However, you can achieve your profit target goals by using your preferred strategy when it comes to exit the market. We encourage you to experiment different exit strategies and see which one yields better results. 
Note** the above was an example of a SELL trade using our favorite Dash strategy. Use the same rules for a BUY trade – but in reverse.

The bitcoin dominance is 56%. So the total marketcap of the other coins should be 44%. 

Total marketcap: 54.000.000.000 / 44% = 122.727.000.000 usd 
Bitcoin: 122.727.000.000 - 54.000.000.000 = 68.727.000.000 usd 

So the bitcoin should multiplied by 68.727.000.000 / 138.000.000.000 = 50%

Technical analysis: 
DASH/DOLLAR is in a range bound and beginning of up trend is expected.  
The price is below the 21-Day WEMA which acts as a dynamic resistance.  
The  RSI  is at 47.  

Trading suggestion: 
The price is in a range bound, but we forecast the uptrend would begin.  
There is possibility of temporary retracement to suggested  support zone  (417 to 281), if so, traders can set orders based on Daily-Trading-Opportunities and expect to reach short-term targets.  

Beginning of entry zone (417)  
Ending of entry zone (281)  

Entry signal: 
Signal to enter the market occurs when the price comes to ""Buy zone"" then forms one of the reversal patterns, whether ""Bullish Engulfing"", ""Hammer"" or ""Valley"", in other words,  
NO entry signal when the price comes to the zone BUT after any of reversal patterns is formed in the zone.

Get ready to DASH when the dollar goes digital! 


Dash -2.09%  is one of my favourite altcoins with respect to crypto as a globally scalable currency instead of a flawed overbought asset or fancy network-platform disguised as a currency. 
Day trading in the ultra-short ranges along with wave traders and bandwagon enthusiasts may seem appealing to a ripoff alt coin, but when it comes to Dash, the bears may be devastated by the returns the bulls will brag about in the years to come. 

If any cryptocurrency is going to disrupt fiat forex and drop the world on its head, the chances are in favour of Dash. The only currency powerful enough to challenge Dash in a race will resemble the digital dollar, or literally be a BANKcoin/FEDcoin issued by the whales of central/retail banking. 
Gold 0.16%  and  silver -1.06%  are no longer used as a currency, or even as a backing-asset anymore. The only system on Earth hoarding  gold 0.16%  are the reserves, or industry players directly involved in the utilitarian usage of the metal. 
Backing a currency by the  gold 0.16%  standard is no longer what Planet Earth chooses to do with their matter. Fiat is now lubricating the cogs of finance and society, driving us forward into the future of money! 
Maybe even the martians understand the benefits of a digital dollar or even Dash over the illusion of metallic gold? 

My positions still remain the same from 2018 - 2020: 
Dash is basically Litecoin 2.0 and  Bitcoin -0.74%  3.0 

1.  Bitcoin -0.60%  is an awesome historic asset, not a viable global currency. (LONG) 
2.  Bitcoin Cash -2.47%  is a sham, and worth less than the pixels of this text you are reading (0.0). (DUMP) 
3.  Ethereum -0.07% may be shorted heavily in June for  BTC -0.60%  but is still a really cool network-platform! (LONG) 
4.  Litecoin -1.64%  is kind of a sham as well...Repeat the mistakes of  Bitcoin -0.74% , pump it up and hope nobody finds out before it is too late! (DUMP) 
5.  Eos -5.01%  is pretty cool as well! An innovative platform with room to grow, but not a true cryptocurrency (LONG) 
6.  Dash -2.09%  is the star of the show, and the reason for this chart. No other crypto is positioned in the market to scale globally as big as Dash is! (LONG) 

I will probably chart all of the cryptos I discussed to go into details on each, and clarify what my projections and positions are currently. 
With a future so bright and a fresh cryptocurrency ready to visit the moon, why would I want to short so early and lose out? 
If you miss out on the small pop & drop, keep tuned for market moves over the next few months. 
We live in an amazing world, and I am very excited for what tomorrow holds!

Comment:
					I also want to add that I am not paid by ANYBODY to market or shill/pitch their products. My charts are backed by where my investments are or where my head is at. 

If I make a call that a project is doomed, it is not because I want to crash the market price for revenge, or to trick others into handing me their crypto at rock-bottom prices. 

It is because I want to get a timestamp next to my ideas, to come back down the road later and see how my investments line up with the progress of the crypto industry overall. 

If someone pays me to peddle their coin to my TV followers/readers, I will make it extremely clear I have an incentive for my opinions outside of what I am already invested in.

224,1528431622.0,Procinctu,Bollinger Band Squeeze: Will Volatility pick up on DASH?,"
DASH has been fairly stagnant over the last few days. On several time frames, conditions for a  Bollinger Band  Squeeze are met. 

You can visibly see on the chart that the bands are contracting. Another thing you want to look for is the  Bollinger Band  Width. On a daily, many look for a 6 month low for the squeeze to be in play. 

As this is the 4 hour chart, the equivalent of 30 days would be about the same amount of candles as if it were a  daily chart . Interestingly, that last time the  Bollinger Band  Width was THIS low, was just before the big Crypto run up in late 2017. 

I don't know that the same kind of  volatility  from 2017 will come in just yet....but the probability is increased that some form of  volatility  can be expected...in either direction, up or down.

This sharp acceleration usually is the last stage of a bull cryptocurrency market, and it’s followed by a sharp reversal if all the trading criteria for a valid Spike and Ledge are met.

Total marketcap: 54.000.000.000 / 44% = 122.727.000.000 usd 
Bitcoin: 122.727.000.000 - 54.000.000.000 = 68.727.000.000 usd 

So the bitcoin should multiplied by 68.727.000.000 / 138.000.000.000 = 50%

Get ready to DASH when the dollar goes digital! 


Dash -1.94%  is one of my favourite altcoins with respect to crypto as a globally scalable currency instead of a flawed overbought asset or fancy network-platform disguised as a currency. 
Day trading in the ultra-short ranges along with wave traders and bandwagon enthusiasts may seem appealing to a ripoff alt coin, but when it comes to Dash, the bears may be devastated by the returns the bulls will brag about in the years to come. 

If any cryptocurrency is going to disrupt fiat forex and drop the world on its head, the chances are in favour of Dash. The only currency powerful enough to challenge Dash in a race will resemble the digital dollar, or literally be a BANKcoin/FEDcoin issued by the whales of central/retail banking. 
Gold 0.17%  and  silver -1.12%  are no longer used as a currency, or even as a backing-asset anymore. The only system on Earth hoarding  gold 0.17%  are the reserves, or industry players directly involved in the utilitarian usage of the metal. 
Backing a currency by the  gold 0.17%  standard is no longer what Planet Earth chooses to do with their matter. Fiat is now lubricating the cogs of finance and society, driving us forward into the future of money! 
Maybe even the martians understand the benefits of a digital dollar or even Dash over the illusion of metallic gold?

245,1527710414.0,Tradingstrategyguides,DASH SPIKE & LEDGE REVERSAL CRYPTO STRATEGY,"




May 30




Step #1: Dash cryptocurrency price needs to show a steady rise that suddenly accelerates to the upside. 
When this reversal pattern is complete, it will resemble a cup with a sharp bottom. 
This sharp acceleration usually is the last stage of a bull cryptocurrency market, and it’s followed by a sharp reversal if all the trading criteria for a valid Spike and Ledge are met. 
In  technical analysis , professional traders also refer to this last spike as being an exhaustion reversal bar that has a high probability of signaling a reversal in the Dash price. 
Now, before we can trade successfully, we need to understand that this key climax reversal bar needs to follow specific trading rules. 
More specifically, this exhaustion reversal bar needs to follow three rules, which we’re going to highlight next. 
Step #2: The exhaustion reversal bar needs to be bigger than the previous bar 
Relatively speaking the exhaustion bar, which should be the last bar within the downtrend, needs to be bigger than the previous bars. However, this is not mandatory. 
Ideally, the bigger the climax bar is in comparison with the other bars within the  bullish trend , the more profitable the reversal pattern becomes. 
Step #3: The climax bar needs to develop at a key sup/res level or after breaking a key swing low/high 
We can’t stress enough the importance of location in trading. 
Many times you’ll notice that a chart pattern will fail, but that’s not because that price pattern has stopped working. It’s often the case that you don’t have the patience for these patterns to develop at the right location. 
In order for the Dash cryptocurrency trading strategy to work we need to wait for the exhaustion bar to show up at the right location. 
Step #4: The exhaustion bar develops after several  bullish  impulsive bars 
We need to make sure that the exhaustion bar occurs after several  bullish  impulsive bars. 
These impulsive  bullish  bars will make the appearance of a  bullish trend  that will trap many sellers once the tide turns. And that’s how retail traders trade the markets, but to trade profitably, you need to trade against the retail mindset. 
Step #5: After the upward spike, wait for the market to enter into a short period of consolidation or channeling. 
Usually, after the Dash cryptocurrency price had that last spike up the market will take a pause to digest the recent move, and it will start moving into a short period of consolidation or channeling. 
Simply, draw two parallel lines to contain this price range. 
Now, this is what we refer to as being the “Ledge.” 
The Spike and Ledge reversal pattern satisfies all trading conditions outlined above which mean that we can move forward and describe how to sell Dash coin. 
Step #6: Sell Dash coin when we break below the Ledge 
A short trade is entered on the breakout of the Ledge. 
This is an easy entry method, but in order to avoid the short-term noise and the usual false breakouts, we need also to wait for the breakout candle to close below the Ledge. 
Step #7: Place your protective Stop Loss above the Exhaustion bar 
The initial protective stop loss is placed on the other side of the reversal pattern. 
You hide your stop loss above the exhaustion bar. 
Step #8: Your Take Profit needs to be two or three times bigger than your risk aka your stop loss. 
As a general rule, you do want your take profit to be bigger than your stop loss. This is very important to your long-term survival in this business. 
However, you can achieve your profit target goals by using your preferred strategy when it comes to exit the market. We encourage you to experiment different exit strategies and see which one yields better results. 
Note** the above was an example of a SELL trade using our favorite Dash strategy. Use the same rules for a BUY trade – but in reverse.

247,1528131496.0,FX_Academy,Dash (DASH/USD) still in a correction ,"
The price of Dash has retraced to the starting point of an impulse wave, which discards the possibility that the first upside impulse was a wave 1 from a larger degree, because if that was the case wave 2 couldn't retrace 100% as the price did. So we are seeing another corrective wave and it's likely going to be a Y wave from a WXY correction in the opposite direction from the massive  ABC  move we saw prior. That would all mean that another down move is coming after the Y ends on the upside.

I tried to make a good reflection of the whole cryptomarket. I only could do this with coins that been trading for more than a year. Otherwise the chart did not work. So I made a chart with the following coins: 
BTC -0.78% , ETH, XRP, LTC, DASH, NEO, MONERO,  XEM -1.35% 

If people also wanna chart on this chart use the following ticker: 
COINBASE:BTCUSD*16692550+BITFINEX:ETHUSD*92862174+BITTREX:XRPUSD*38622892459+BITFINEX:LTCUSD*53927233+BITTREX:DASHUSD*7701656+BITTREX:NEOUSD*65000000+BITTREX:XMRUSD*15377976+BITTREX:XEMUSD*8999999999 

About the charts 
The first chart you see is on the logic alghoritme. The second one in normal view. 

On the first alghoritme we see a big rising wedge! On the second one you see the beautifull elliot-wave pattern. The 5th wave or 3th wave up reached the 1.618 fibonacci level, the same level als the last crash.  

I think there could be an abc-correction wave. With a total retracement of the whole cryptocurrancy market of 35-55%. 

Some other information to think about. Correct me when i'm wrong! 
First crash:  
-20 june the total marketcap of cryptocurrancies was 115 million.  
-16 july the total marketcap of cryptocurrancies 67 million  

Trigger: The first  bitcoin -0.78%  fork?  

Second crash:  
-1 september the total marketcap of cryptocurrancies was 174 million.  
-15 september the total marketcap of cryptocurrancies was 109 million.  

Trigger: China Ban?  

The last and upcomming crash>  
It should be time for a correction of the total market! I think there is a huge change.  

Trigger: I really think the Tether usd hack could trigger a crash.  

Last thing I want to say, I try to do an objective view. I believe it will happen. You don't have to agree with me, take your own conclusion!

May 30




Step #1: Dash cryptocurrency price needs to show a steady rise that suddenly accelerates to the upside. 
When this reversal pattern is complete, it will resemble a cup with a sharp bottom. 
This sharp acceleration usually is the last stage of a bull cryptocurrency market, and it’s followed by a sharp reversal if all the trading criteria for a valid Spike and Ledge are met. 
In  technical analysis , professional traders also refer to this last spike as being an exhaustion reversal bar that has a high probability of signaling a reversal in the Dash price. 
Now, before we can trade successfully, we need to understand that this key climax reversal bar needs to follow specific trading rules. 
More specifically, this exhaustion reversal bar needs to follow three rules, which we’re going to highlight next. 
Step #2: The exhaustion reversal bar needs to be bigger than the previous bar 
Relatively speaking the exhaustion bar, which should be the last bar within the downtrend, needs to be bigger than the previous bars. However, this is not mandatory. 
Ideally, the bigger the climax bar is in comparison with the other bars within the  bullish trend , the more profitable the reversal pattern becomes. 
Step #3: The climax bar needs to develop at a key sup/res level or after breaking a key swing low/high 
We can’t stress enough the importance of location in trading. 
Many times you’ll notice that a chart pattern will fail, but that’s not because that price pattern has stopped working. It’s often the case that you don’t have the patience for these patterns to develop at the right location. 
In order for the Dash cryptocurrency trading strategy to work we need to wait for the exhaustion bar to show up at the right location. 
Step #4: The exhaustion bar develops after several  bullish  impulsive bars 
We need to make sure that the exhaustion bar occurs after several  bullish  impulsive bars. 
These impulsive  bullish  bars will make the appearance of a  bullish trend  that will trap many sellers once the tide turns. And that’s how retail traders trade the markets, but to trade profitably, you need to trade against the retail mindset. 
Step #5: After the upward spike, wait for the market to enter into a short period of consolidation or channeling. 
Usually, after the Dash cryptocurrency price had that last spike up the market will take a pause to digest the recent move, and it will start moving into a short period of consolidation or channeling. 
Simply, draw two parallel lines to contain this price range. 
Now, this is what we refer to as being the “Ledge.” 
The Spike and Ledge reversal pattern satisfies all trading conditions outlined above which mean that we can move forward and describe how to sell Dash coin. 
Step #6: Sell Dash coin when we break below the Ledge 
A short trade is entered on the breakout of the Ledge. 
This is an easy entry method, but in order to avoid the short-term noise and the usual false breakouts, we need also to wait for the breakout candle to close below the Ledge. 
Step #7: Place your protective Stop Loss above the Exhaustion bar 
The initial protective stop loss is placed on the other side of the reversal pattern. 
You hide your stop loss above the exhaustion bar. 
Step #8: Your Take Profit needs to be two or three times bigger than your risk aka your stop loss. 
As a general rule, you do want your take profit to be bigger than your stop loss. This is very important to your long-term survival in this business. 
However, you can achieve your profit target goals by using your preferred strategy when it comes to exit the market. We encourage you to experiment different exit strategies and see which one yields better results. 
Note** the above was an example of a SELL trade using our favorite Dash strategy. Use the same rules for a BUY trade – but in reverse.

About the charts 
The first chart you see is on the logic alghoritme. The second one in normal view. 

On the first alghoritme we see a big rising wedge! On the second one you see the beautifull elliot-wave pattern. The 5th wave or 3th wave up reached the 1.618 fibonacci level, the same level als the last crash.

First crash:

The bitcoin dominance is 56%. So the total marketcap of the other coins should be 44%. 

Total marketcap: 54.000.000.000 / 44% = 122.727.000.000 usd 
Bitcoin: 122.727.000.000 - 54.000.000.000 = 68.727.000.000 usd 

So the bitcoin should multiplied by 68.727.000.000 / 138.000.000.000 = 50%

Technical analysis: 
DASH/DOLLAR is in a range bound and beginning of up trend is expected.  
The price is below the 21-Day WEMA which acts as a dynamic resistance.  
The  RSI  is at 47.  

Trading suggestion: 
The price is in a range bound, but we forecast the uptrend would begin.  
There is possibility of temporary retracement to suggested  support zone  (417 to 281), if so, traders can set orders based on Daily-Trading-Opportunities and expect to reach short-term targets.  

Beginning of entry zone (417)  
Ending of entry zone (281)  

Entry signal: 
Signal to enter the market occurs when the price comes to ""Buy zone"" then forms one of the reversal patterns, whether ""Bullish Engulfing"", ""Hammer"" or ""Valley"", in other words,  
NO entry signal when the price comes to the zone BUT after any of reversal patterns is formed in the zone.

Get ready to DASH when the dollar goes digital! 


Dash -1.97%  is one of my favourite altcoins with respect to crypto as a globally scalable currency instead of a flawed overbought asset or fancy network-platform disguised as a currency. 
Day trading in the ultra-short ranges along with wave traders and bandwagon enthusiasts may seem appealing to a ripoff alt coin, but when it comes to Dash, the bears may be devastated by the returns the bulls will brag about in the years to come. 

If any cryptocurrency is going to disrupt fiat forex and drop the world on its head, the chances are in favour of Dash. The only currency powerful enough to challenge Dash in a race will resemble the digital dollar, or literally be a BANKcoin/FEDcoin issued by the whales of central/retail banking. 
Gold 0.15%  and  silver -1.12%  are no longer used as a currency, or even as a backing-asset anymore. The only system on Earth hoarding  gold 0.15%  are the reserves, or industry players directly involved in the utilitarian usage of the metal. 
Backing a currency by the  gold 0.15%  standard is no longer what Planet Earth chooses to do with their matter. Fiat is now lubricating the cogs of finance and society, driving us forward into the future of money! 
Maybe even the martians understand the benefits of a digital dollar or even Dash over the illusion of metallic gold? 

My positions still remain the same from 2018 - 2020: 
Dash is basically Litecoin 2.0 and  Bitcoin -0.75%  3.0 

1.  Bitcoin -0.63%  is an awesome historic asset, not a viable global currency. (LONG) 
2.  Bitcoin Cash -2.48%  is a sham, and worth less than the pixels of this text you are reading (0.0). (DUMP) 
3.  Ethereum -0.07% may be shorted heavily in June for  BTC -0.63%  but is still a really cool network-platform! (LONG) 
4.  Litecoin -1.64%  is kind of a sham as well...Repeat the mistakes of  Bitcoin -0.75% , pump it up and hope nobody finds out before it is too late! (DUMP) 
5.  Eos -5.12%  is pretty cool as well! An innovative platform with room to grow, but not a true cryptocurrency (LONG) 
6.  Dash -1.97%  is the star of the show, and the reason for this chart. No other crypto is positioned in the market to scale globally as big as Dash is! (LONG) 

I will probably chart all of the cryptos I discussed to go into details on each, and clarify what my projections and positions are currently. 
With a future so bright and a fresh cryptocurrency ready to visit the moon, why would I want to short so early and lose out? 
If you miss out on the small pop & drop, keep tuned for market moves over the next few months. 
We live in an amazing world, and I am very excited for what tomorrow holds!

Comment:
					I also want to add that I am not paid by ANYBODY to market or shill/pitch their products. My charts are backed by where my investments are or where my head is at. 

If I make a call that a project is doomed, it is not because I want to crash the market price for revenge, or to trick others into handing me their crypto at rock-bottom prices. 

It is because I want to get a timestamp next to my ideas, to come back down the road later and see how my investments line up with the progress of the crypto industry overall. 

If someone pays me to peddle their coin to my TV followers/readers, I will make it extremely clear I have an incentive for my opinions outside of what I am already invested in.

278,1528431622.0,Procinctu,Bollinger Band Squeeze: Will Volatility pick up on DASH?,"
DASH has been fairly stagnant over the last few days. On several time frames, conditions for a  Bollinger Band  Squeeze are met. 

You can visibly see on the chart that the bands are contracting. Another thing you want to look for is the  Bollinger Band  Width. On a daily, many look for a 6 month low for the squeeze to be in play. 

As this is the 4 hour chart, the equivalent of 30 days would be about the same amount of candles as if it were a  daily chart . Interestingly, that last time the  Bollinger Band  Width was THIS low, was just before the big Crypto run up in late 2017. 

I don't know that the same kind of  volatility  from 2017 will come in just yet....but the probability is increased that some form of  volatility  can be expected...in either direction, up or down.

The bitcoin dominance is 56%. So the total marketcap of the other coins should be 44%. 

Total marketcap: 54.000.000.000 / 44% = 122.727.000.000 usd 
Bitcoin: 122.727.000.000 - 54.000.000.000 = 68.727.000.000 usd 

So the bitcoin should multiplied by 68.727.000.000 / 138.000.000.000 = 50%

Get ready to DASH when the dollar goes digital! 


Dash -1.94%  is one of my favourite altcoins with respect to crypto as a globally scalable currency instead of a flawed overbought asset or fancy network-platform disguised as a currency. 
Day trading in the ultra-short ranges along with wave traders and bandwagon enthusiasts may seem appealing to a ripoff alt coin, but when it comes to Dash, the bears may be devastated by the returns the bulls will brag about in the years to come. 

If any cryptocurrency is going to disrupt fiat forex and drop the world on its head, the chances are in favour of Dash. The only currency powerful enough to challenge Dash in a race will resemble the digital dollar, or literally be a BANKcoin/FEDcoin issued by the whales of central/retail banking. 
Gold 0.15%  and  silver -0.89%  are no longer used as a currency, or even as a backing-asset anymore. The only system on Earth hoarding  gold 0.15%  are the reserves, or industry players directly involved in the utilitarian usage of the metal. 
Backing a currency by the  gold 0.15%  standard is no longer what Planet Earth chooses to do with their matter. Fiat is now lubricating the cogs of finance and society, driving us forward into the future of money! 
Maybe even the martians understand the benefits of a digital dollar or even Dash over the illusion of metallic gold? 

My positions still remain the same from 2018 - 2020: 
Dash is basically Litecoin 2.0 and  Bitcoin -0.72%  3.0

296,1528431622.0,Procinctu,Bollinger Band Squeeze: Will Volatility pick up on DASH?,"
DASH has been fairly stagnant over the last few days. On several time frames, conditions for a  Bollinger Band  Squeeze are met. 

You can visibly see on the chart that the bands are contracting. Another thing you want to look for is the  Bollinger Band  Width. On a daily, many look for a 6 month low for the squeeze to be in play. 

As this is the 4 hour chart, the equivalent of 30 days would be about the same amount of candles as if it were a  daily chart . Interestingly, that last time the  Bollinger Band  Width was THIS low, was just before the big Crypto run up in late 2017. 

I don't know that the same kind of  volatility  from 2017 will come in just yet....but the probability is increased that some form of  volatility  can be expected...in either direction, up or down.

299,1527710414.0,Tradingstrategyguides,DASH SPIKE & LEDGE REVERSAL CRYPTO STRATEGY,"




May 30




Step #1: Dash cryptocurrency price needs to show a steady rise that suddenly accelerates to the upside. 
When this reversal pattern is complete, it will resemble a cup with a sharp bottom. 
This sharp acceleration usually is the last stage of a bull cryptocurrency market, and it’s followed by a sharp reversal if all the trading criteria for a valid Spike and Ledge are met. 
In  technical analysis , professional traders also refer to this last spike as being an exhaustion reversal bar that has a high probability of signaling a reversal in the Dash price. 
Now, before we can trade successfully, we need to understand that this key climax reversal bar needs to follow specific trading rules. 
More specifically, this exhaustion reversal bar needs to follow three rules, which we’re going to highlight next. 
Step #2: The exhaustion reversal bar needs to be bigger than the previous bar 
Relatively speaking the exhaustion bar, which should be the last bar within the downtrend, needs to be bigger than the previous bars. However, this is not mandatory. 
Ideally, the bigger the climax bar is in comparison with the other bars within the  bullish trend , the more profitable the reversal pattern becomes. 
Step #3: The climax bar needs to develop at a key sup/res level or after breaking a key swing low/high 
We can’t stress enough the importance of location in trading. 
Many times you’ll notice that a chart pattern will fail, but that’s not because that price pattern has stopped working. It’s often the case that you don’t have the patience for these patterns to develop at the right location. 
In order for the Dash cryptocurrency trading strategy to work we need to wait for the exhaustion bar to show up at the right location. 
Step #4: The exhaustion bar develops after several  bullish  impulsive bars 
We need to make sure that the exhaustion bar occurs after several  bullish  impulsive bars. 
These impulsive  bullish  bars will make the appearance of a  bullish trend  that will trap many sellers once the tide turns. And that’s how retail traders trade the markets, but to trade profitably, you need to trade against the retail mindset. 
Step #5: After the upward spike, wait for the market to enter into a short period of consolidation or channeling. 
Usually, after the Dash cryptocurrency price had that last spike up the market will take a pause to digest the recent move, and it will start moving into a short period of consolidation or channeling. 
Simply, draw two parallel lines to contain this price range. 
Now, this is what we refer to as being the “Ledge.” 
The Spike and Ledge reversal pattern satisfies all trading conditions outlined above which mean that we can move forward and describe how to sell Dash coin. 
Step #6: Sell Dash coin when we break below the Ledge 
A short trade is entered on the breakout of the Ledge. 
This is an easy entry method, but in order to avoid the short-term noise and the usual false breakouts, we need also to wait for the breakout candle to close below the Ledge. 
Step #7: Place your protective Stop Loss above the Exhaustion bar 
The initial protective stop loss is placed on the other side of the reversal pattern. 
You hide your stop loss above the exhaustion bar. 
Step #8: Your Take Profit needs to be two or three times bigger than your risk aka your stop loss. 
As a general rule, you do want your take profit to be bigger than your stop loss. This is very important to your long-term survival in this business. 
However, you can achieve your profit target goals by using your preferred strategy when it comes to exit the market. We encourage you to experiment different exit strategies and see which one yields better results. 
Note** the above was an example of a SELL trade using our favorite Dash strategy. Use the same rules for a BUY trade – but in reverse.

301,1528131496.0,FX_Academy,Dash (DASH/USD) still in a correction ,"
The price of Dash has retraced to the starting point of an impulse wave, which discards the possibility that the first upside impulse was a wave 1 from a larger degree, because if that was the case wave 2 couldn't retrace 100% as the price did. So we are seeing another corrective wave and it's likely going to be a Y wave from a WXY correction in the opposite direction from the massive  ABC  move we saw prior. That would all mean that another down move is coming after the Y ends on the upside.

I tried to make a good reflection of the whole cryptomarket. I only could do this with coins that been trading for more than a year. Otherwise the chart did not work. So I made a chart with the following coins: 
BTC -0.73% , ETH, XRP, LTC, DASH, NEO, MONERO,  XEM -1.35%

About the charts 
The first chart you see is on the logic alghoritme. The second one in normal view. 

On the first alghoritme we see a big rising wedge! On the second one you see the beautifull elliot-wave pattern. The 5th wave or 3th wave up reached the 1.618 fibonacci level, the same level als the last crash.  

I think there could be an abc-correction wave. With a total retracement of the whole cryptocurrancy market of 35-55%. 

Some other information to think about. Correct me when i'm wrong! 
First crash:  
-20 june the total marketcap of cryptocurrancies was 115 million.  
-16 july the total marketcap of cryptocurrancies 67 million  

Trigger: The first  bitcoin -0.73%  fork?  

Second crash:  
-1 september the total marketcap of cryptocurrancies was 174 million.  
-15 september the total marketcap of cryptocurrancies was 109 million.  

Trigger: China Ban?

It should be time for a correction of the total market! I think there is a huge change.

You can visibly see on the chart that the bands are contracting. Another thing you want to look for is the  Bollinger Band  Width. On a daily, many look for a 6 month low for the squeeze to be in play. 

As this is the 4 hour chart, the equivalent of 30 days would be about the same amount of candles as if it were a  daily chart . Interestingly, that last time the  Bollinger Band  Width was THIS low, was just before the big Crypto run up in late 2017. 

I don't know that the same kind of  volatility  from 2017 will come in just yet....but the probability is increased that some form of  volatility  can be expected...in either direction, up or down.

May 30




Step #1: Dash cryptocurrency price needs to show a steady rise that suddenly accelerates to the upside. 
When this reversal pattern is complete, it will resemble a cup with a sharp bottom. 
This sharp acceleration usually is the last stage of a bull cryptocurrency market, and it’s followed by a sharp reversal if all the trading criteria for a valid Spike and Ledge are met. 
In  technical analysis , professional traders also refer to this last spike as being an exhaustion reversal bar that has a high probability of signaling a reversal in the Dash price. 
Now, before we can trade successfully, we need to understand that this key climax reversal bar needs to follow specific trading rules. 
More specifically, this exhaustion reversal bar needs to follow three rules, which we’re going to highlight next. 
Step #2: The exhaustion reversal bar needs to be bigger than the previous bar 
Relatively speaking the exhaustion bar, which should be the last bar within the downtrend, needs to be bigger than the previous bars. However, this is not mandatory. 
Ideally, the bigger the climax bar is in comparison with the other bars within the  bullish trend , the more profitable the reversal pattern becomes. 
Step #3: The climax bar needs to develop at a key sup/res level or after breaking a key swing low/high 
We can’t stress enough the importance of location in trading. 
Many times you’ll notice that a chart pattern will fail, but that’s not because that price pattern has stopped working. It’s often the case that you don’t have the patience for these patterns to develop at the right location. 
In order for the Dash cryptocurrency trading strategy to work we need to wait for the exhaustion bar to show up at the right location. 
Step #4: The exhaustion bar develops after several  bullish  impulsive bars 
We need to make sure that the exhaustion bar occurs after several  bullish  impulsive bars. 
These impulsive  bullish  bars will make the appearance of a  bullish trend  that will trap many sellers once the tide turns. And that’s how retail traders trade the markets, but to trade profitably, you need to trade against the retail mindset. 
Step #5: After the upward spike, wait for the market to enter into a short period of consolidation or channeling. 
Usually, after the Dash cryptocurrency price had that last spike up the market will take a pause to digest the recent move, and it will start moving into a short period of consolidation or channeling. 
Simply, draw two parallel lines to contain this price range. 
Now, this is what we refer to as being the “Ledge.” 
The Spike and Ledge reversal pattern satisfies all trading conditions outlined above which mean that we can move forward and describe how to sell Dash coin. 
Step #6: Sell Dash coin when we break below the Ledge 
A short trade is entered on the breakout of the Ledge. 
This is an easy entry method, but in order to avoid the short-term noise and the usual false breakouts, we need also to wait for the breakout candle to close below the Ledge. 
Step #7: Place your protective Stop Loss above the Exhaustion bar 
The initial protective stop loss is placed on the other side of the reversal pattern. 
You hide your stop loss above the exhaustion bar. 
Step #8: Your Take Profit needs to be two or three times bigger than your risk aka your stop loss. 
As a general rule, you do want your take profit to be bigger than your stop loss. This is very important to your long-term survival in this business. 
However, you can achieve your profit target goals by using your preferred strategy when it comes to exit the market. We encourage you to experiment different exit strategies and see which one yields better results. 
Note** the above was an example of a SELL trade using our favorite Dash strategy. Use the same rules for a BUY trade – but in reverse.

I tried to make a good reflection of the whole cryptomarket. I only could do this with coins that been trading for more than a year. Otherwise the chart did not work. So I made a chart with the following coins: 
BTC -0.75% , ETH, XRP, LTC, DASH, NEO, MONERO,  XEM -1.35% 

If people also wanna chart on this chart use the following ticker: 
COINBASE:BTCUSD*16692550+BITFINEX:ETHUSD*92862174+BITTREX:XRPUSD*38622892459+BITFINEX:LTCUSD*53927233+BITTREX:DASHUSD*7701656+BITTREX:NEOUSD*65000000+BITTREX:XMRUSD*15377976+BITTREX:XEMUSD*8999999999 

About the charts 
The first chart you see is on the logic alghoritme. The second one in normal view. 

On the first alghoritme we see a big rising wedge! On the second one you see the beautifull elliot-wave pattern. The 5th wave or 3th wave up reached the 1.618 fibonacci level, the same level als the last crash.  

I think there could be an abc-correction wave. With a total retracement of the whole cryptocurrancy market of 35-55%. 

Some other information to think about. Correct me when i'm wrong! 
First crash:  
-20 june the total marketcap of cryptocurrancies was 115 million.  
-16 july the total marketcap of cryptocurrancies 67 million  

Trigger: The first  bitcoin -0.75%  fork?  

Second crash:  
-1 september the total marketcap of cryptocurrancies was 174 million.  
-15 september the total marketcap of cryptocurrancies was 109 million.  

Trigger: China Ban?  

The last and upcomming crash>  
It should be time for a correction of the total market! I think there is a huge change.  

Trigger: I really think the Tether usd hack could trigger a crash.  

Last thing I want to say, I try to do an objective view. I believe it will happen. You don't have to agree with me, take your own conclusion!

The bitcoin dominance is 56%. So the total marketcap of the other coins should be 44%. 

Total marketcap: 54.000.000.000 / 44% = 122.727.000.000 usd 
Bitcoin: 122.727.000.000 - 54.000.000.000 = 68.727.000.000 usd 

So the bitcoin should multiplied by 68.727.000.000 / 138.000.000.000 = 50%

Technical analysis: 
DASH/DOLLAR is in a range bound and beginning of up trend is expected.  
The price is below the 21-Day WEMA which acts as a dynamic resistance.  
The  RSI  is at 47.  

Trading suggestion: 
The price is in a range bound, but we forecast the uptrend would begin.  
There is possibility of temporary retracement to suggested  support zone  (417 to 281), if so, traders can set orders based on Daily-Trading-Opportunities and expect to reach short-term targets.  

Beginning of entry zone (417)  
Ending of entry zone (281)  

Entry signal: 
Signal to enter the market occurs when the price comes to ""Buy zone"" then forms one of the reversal patterns, whether ""Bullish Engulfing"", ""Hammer"" or ""Valley"", in other words,  
NO entry signal when the price comes to the zone BUT after any of reversal patterns is formed in the zone.

Get ready to DASH when the dollar goes digital! 


Dash -2.11%  is one of my favourite altcoins with respect to crypto as a globally scalable currency instead of a flawed overbought asset or fancy network-platform disguised as a currency. 
Day trading in the ultra-short ranges along with wave traders and bandwagon enthusiasts may seem appealing to a ripoff alt coin, but when it comes to Dash, the bears may be devastated by the returns the bulls will brag about in the years to come. 

If any cryptocurrency is going to disrupt fiat forex and drop the world on its head, the chances are in favour of Dash. The only currency powerful enough to challenge Dash in a race will resemble the digital dollar, or literally be a BANKcoin/FEDcoin issued by the whales of central/retail banking. 
Gold 0.21%  and  silver -1.06%  are no longer used as a currency, or even as a backing-asset anymore. The only system on Earth hoarding  gold 0.21%  are the reserves, or industry players directly involved in the utilitarian usage of the metal. 
Backing a currency by the  gold 0.21%  standard is no longer what Planet Earth chooses to do with their matter. Fiat is now lubricating the cogs of finance and society, driving us forward into the future of money! 
Maybe even the martians understand the benefits of a digital dollar or even Dash over the illusion of metallic gold? 

My positions still remain the same from 2018 - 2020: 
Dash is basically Litecoin 2.0 and  Bitcoin -0.76%  3.0 

1.  Bitcoin -0.63%  is an awesome historic asset, not a viable global currency. (LONG) 
2.  Bitcoin Cash -2.48%  is a sham, and worth less than the pixels of this text you are reading (0.0). (DUMP) 
3.  Ethereum -0.07% may be shorted heavily in June for  BTC -0.63%  but is still a really cool network-platform! (LONG) 
4.  Litecoin -1.64%  is kind of a sham as well...Repeat the mistakes of  Bitcoin -0.76% , pump it up and hope nobody finds out before it is too late! (DUMP) 
5.  Eos -4.97%  is pretty cool as well! An innovative platform with room to grow, but not a true cryptocurrency (LONG) 
6.  Dash -2.11%  is the star of the show, and the reason for this chart. No other crypto is positioned in the market to scale globally as big as Dash is! (LONG) 

I will probably chart all of the cryptos I discussed to go into details on each, and clarify what my projections and positions are currently. 
With a future so bright and a fresh cryptocurrency ready to visit the moon, why would I want to short so early and lose out? 
If you miss out on the small pop & drop, keep tuned for market moves over the next few months. 
We live in an amazing world, and I am very excited for what tomorrow holds!

Comment:
					I also want to add that I am not paid by ANYBODY to market or shill/pitch their products. My charts are backed by where my investments are or where my head is at. 

If I make a call that a project is doomed, it is not because I want to crash the market price for revenge, or to trick others into handing me their crypto at rock-bottom prices. 

It is because I want to get a timestamp next to my ideas, to come back down the road later and see how my investments line up with the progress of the crypto industry overall. 

If someone pays me to peddle their coin to my TV followers/readers, I will make it extremely clear I have an incentive for my opinions outside of what I am already invested in.

I tried to make a good reflection of the whole cryptomarket. I only could do this with coins that been trading for more than a year. Otherwise the chart did not work. So I made a chart with the following coins: 
BTC -0.78% , ETH, XRP, LTC, DASH, NEO, MONERO,  XEM -1.35% 

If people also wanna chart on this chart use the following ticker: 
COINBASE:BTCUSD*16692550+BITFINEX:ETHUSD*92862174+BITTREX:XRPUSD*38622892459+BITFINEX:LTCUSD*53927233+BITTREX:DASHUSD*7701656+BITTREX:NEOUSD*65000000+BITTREX:XMRUSD*15377976+BITTREX:XEMUSD*8999999999 

About the charts 
The first chart you see is on the logic alghoritme. The second one in normal view. 

On the first alghoritme we see a big rising wedge! On the second one you see the beautifull elliot-wave pattern. The 5th wave or 3th wave up reached the 1.618 fibonacci level, the same level als the last crash.  

I think there could be an abc-correction wave. With a total retracement of the whole cryptocurrancy market of 35-55%. 

Some other information to think about. Correct me when i'm wrong! 
First crash:  
-20 june the total marketcap of cryptocurrancies was 115 million.  
-16 july the total marketcap of cryptocurrancies 67 million  

Trigger: The first  bitcoin -0.78%  fork?  

Second crash:  
-1 september the total marketcap of cryptocurrancies was 174 million.  
-15 september the total marketcap of cryptocurrancies was 109 million.  

Trigger: China Ban?  

The last and upcomming crash>  
It should be time for a correction of the total market! I think there is a huge change.  

Trigger: I really think the Tether usd hack could trigger a crash.  

Last thing I want to say, I try to do an objective view. I believe it will happen. You don't have to agree with me, take your own conclusion!

The bitcoin dominance is 56%. So the total marketcap of the other coins should be 44%. 

Total marketcap: 54.000.000.000 / 44% = 122.727.000.000 usd 
Bitcoin: 122.727.000.000 - 54.000.000.000 = 68.727.000.000 usd 

So the bitcoin should multiplied by 68.727.000.000 / 138.000.000.000 = 50%

Get ready to DASH when the dollar goes digital! 


Dash -2.13%  is one of my favourite altcoins with respect to crypto as a globally scalable currency instead of a flawed overbought asset or fancy network-platform disguised as a currency. 
Day trading in the ultra-short ranges along with wave traders and bandwagon enthusiasts may seem appealing to a ripoff alt coin, but when it comes to Dash, the bears may be devastated by the returns the bulls will brag about in the years to come. 

If any cryptocurrency is going to disrupt fiat forex and drop the world on its head, the chances are in favour of Dash. The only currency powerful enough to challenge Dash in a race will resemble the digital dollar, or literally be a BANKcoin/FEDcoin issued by the whales of central/retail banking. 
Gold 0.15%  and  silver -0.89%  are no longer used as a currency, or even as a backing-asset anymore. The only system on Earth hoarding  gold 0.15%  are the reserves, or industry players directly involved in the utilitarian usage of the metal. 
Backing a currency by the  gold 0.15%  standard is no longer what Planet Earth chooses to do with their matter. Fiat is now lubricating the cogs of finance and society, driving us forward into the future of money! 
Maybe even the martians understand the benefits of a digital dollar or even Dash over the illusion of metallic gold? 

My positions still remain the same from 2018 - 2020: 
Dash is basically Litecoin 2.0 and  Bitcoin -0.78%  3.0 

1.  Bitcoin -0.70%  is an awesome historic asset, not a viable global currency. (LONG) 
2.  Bitcoin Cash -2.48%  is a sham, and worth less than the pixels of this text you are reading (0.0). (DUMP) 
3.  Ethereum -0.13% may be shorted heavily in June for  BTC -0.70%  but is still a really cool network-platform! (LONG) 
4.  Litecoin -1.64%  is kind of a sham as well...Repeat the mistakes of  Bitcoin -0.78% , pump it up and hope nobody finds out before it is too late! (DUMP) 
5.  Eos -4.97%  is pretty cool as well! An innovative platform with room to grow, but not a true cryptocurrency (LONG) 
6.  Dash -2.13%  is the star of the show, and the reason for this chart. No other crypto is positioned in the market to scale globally as big as Dash is! (LONG) 

I will probably chart all of the cryptos I discussed to go into details on each, and clarify what my projections and positions are currently. 
With a future so bright and a fresh cryptocurrency ready to visit the moon, why would I want to short so early and lose out? 
If you miss out on the small pop & drop, keep tuned for market moves over the next few months. 
We live in an amazing world, and I am very excited for what tomorrow holds!

Comment:
					I also want to add that I am not paid by ANYBODY to market or shill/pitch their products. My charts are backed by where my investments are or where my head is at. 

If I make a call that a project is doomed, it is not because I want to crash the market price for revenge, or to trick others into handing me their crypto at rock-bottom prices. 

It is because I want to get a timestamp next to my ideas, to come back down the road later and see how my investments line up with the progress of the crypto industry overall. 

If someone pays me to peddle their coin to my TV followers/readers, I will make it extremely clear I have an incentive for my opinions outside of what I am already invested in.

350,1528431622.0,Procinctu,Bollinger Band Squeeze: Will Volatility pick up on DASH?,"
DASH has been fairly stagnant over the last few days. On several time frames, conditions for a  Bollinger Band  Squeeze are met. 

You can visibly see on the chart that the bands are contracting. Another thing you want to look for is the  Bollinger Band  Width. On a daily, many look for a 6 month low for the squeeze to be in play. 

As this is the 4 hour chart, the equivalent of 30 days would be about the same amount of candles as if it were a  daily chart . Interestingly, that last time the  Bollinger Band  Width was THIS low, was just before the big Crypto run up in late 2017. 

I don't know that the same kind of  volatility  from 2017 will come in just yet....but the probability is increased that some form of  volatility  can be expected...in either direction, up or down.

353,1527710414.0,Tradingstrategyguides,DASH SPIKE & LEDGE REVERSAL CRYPTO STRATEGY,"




May 30




Step #1: Dash cryptocurrency price needs to show a steady rise that suddenly accelerates to the upside. 
When this reversal pattern is complete, it will resemble a cup with a sharp bottom. 
This sharp acceleration usually is the last stage of a bull cryptocurrency market, and it’s followed by a sharp reversal if all the trading criteria for a valid Spike and Ledge are met. 
In  technical analysis , professional traders also refer to this last spike as being an exhaustion reversal bar that has a high probability of signaling a reversal in the Dash price. 
Now, before we can trade successfully, we need to understand that this key climax reversal bar needs to follow specific trading rules. 
More specifically, this exhaustion reversal bar needs to follow three rules, which we’re going to highlight next. 
Step #2: The exhaustion reversal bar needs to be bigger than the previous bar 
Relatively speaking the exhaustion bar, which should be the last bar within the downtrend, needs to be bigger than the previous bars. However, this is not mandatory. 
Ideally, the bigger the climax bar is in comparison with the other bars within the  bullish trend , the more profitable the reversal pattern becomes. 
Step #3: The climax bar needs to develop at a key sup/res level or after breaking a key swing low/high 
We can’t stress enough the importance of location in trading. 
Many times you’ll notice that a chart pattern will fail, but that’s not because that price pattern has stopped working. It’s often the case that you don’t have the patience for these patterns to develop at the right location. 
In order for the Dash cryptocurrency trading strategy to work we need to wait for the exhaustion bar to show up at the right location. 
Step #4: The exhaustion bar develops after several  bullish  impulsive bars 
We need to make sure that the exhaustion bar occurs after several  bullish  impulsive bars. 
These impulsive  bullish  bars will make the appearance of a  bullish trend  that will trap many sellers once the tide turns. And that’s how retail traders trade the markets, but to trade profitably, you need to trade against the retail mindset. 
Step #5: After the upward spike, wait for the market to enter into a short period of consolidation or channeling. 
Usually, after the Dash cryptocurrency price had that last spike up the market will take a pause to digest the recent move, and it will start moving into a short period of consolidation or channeling. 
Simply, draw two parallel lines to contain this price range. 
Now, this is what we refer to as being the “Ledge.” 
The Spike and Ledge reversal pattern satisfies all trading conditions outlined above which mean that we can move forward and describe how to sell Dash coin. 
Step #6: Sell Dash coin when we break below the Ledge 
A short trade is entered on the breakout of the Ledge. 
This is an easy entry method, but in order to avoid the short-term noise and the usual false breakouts, we need also to wait for the breakout candle to close below the Ledge. 
Step #7: Place your protective Stop Loss above the Exhaustion bar 
The initial protective stop loss is placed on the other side of the reversal pattern. 
You hide your stop loss above the exhaustion bar. 
Step #8: Your Take Profit needs to be two or three times bigger than your risk aka your stop loss. 
As a general rule, you do want your take profit to be bigger than your stop loss. This is very important to your long-term survival in this business. 
However, you can achieve your profit target goals by using your preferred strategy when it comes to exit the market. We encourage you to experiment different exit strategies and see which one yields better results. 
Note** the above was an example of a SELL trade using our favorite Dash strategy. Use the same rules for a BUY trade – but in reverse.

355,1528131496.0,FX_Academy,Dash (DASH/USD) still in a correction ,"
The price of Dash has retraced to the starting point of an impulse wave, which discards the possibility that the first upside impulse was a wave 1 from a larger degree, because if that was the case wave 2 couldn't retrace 100% as the price did. So we are seeing another corrective wave and it's likely going to be a Y wave from a WXY correction in the opposite direction from the massive  ABC  move we saw prior. That would all mean that another down move is coming after the Y ends on the upside.

DASH has been fairly stagnant over the last few days. On several time frames, conditions for a  Bollinger Band  Squeeze are met. 

You can visibly see on the chart that the bands are contracting. Another thing you want to look for is the  Bollinger Band  Width. On a daily, many look for a 6 month low for the squeeze to be in play. 

As this is the 4 hour chart, the equivalent of 30 days would be about the same amount of candles as if it were a  daily chart . Interestingly, that last time the  Bollinger Band  Width was THIS low, was just before the big Crypto run up in late 2017.

May 30




Step #1: Dash cryptocurrency price needs to show a steady rise that suddenly accelerates to the upside. 
When this reversal pattern is complete, it will resemble a cup with a sharp bottom. 
This sharp acceleration usually is the last stage of a bull cryptocurrency market, and it’s followed by a sharp reversal if all the trading criteria for a valid Spike and Ledge are met. 
In  technical analysis , professional traders also refer to this last spike as being an exhaustion reversal bar that has a high probability of signaling a reversal in the Dash price. 
Now, before we can trade successfully, we need to understand that this key climax reversal bar needs to follow specific trading rules. 
More specifically, this exhaustion reversal bar needs to follow three rules, which we’re going to highlight next. 
Step #2: The exhaustion reversal bar needs to be bigger than the previous bar 
Relatively speaking the exhaustion bar, which should be the last bar within the downtrend, needs to be bigger than the previous bars. However, this is not mandatory. 
Ideally, the bigger the climax bar is in comparison with the other bars within the  bullish trend , the more profitable the reversal pattern becomes. 
Step #3: The climax bar needs to develop at a key sup/res level or after breaking a key swing low/high 
We can’t stress enough the importance of location in trading. 
Many times you’ll notice that a chart pattern will fail, but that’s not because that price pattern has stopped working. It’s often the case that you don’t have the patience for these patterns to develop at the right location. 
In order for the Dash cryptocurrency trading strategy to work we need to wait for the exhaustion bar to show up at the right location. 
Step #4: The exhaustion bar develops after several  bullish  impulsive bars 
We need to make sure that the exhaustion bar occurs after several  bullish  impulsive bars. 
These impulsive  bullish  bars will make the appearance of a  bullish trend  that will trap many sellers once the tide turns. And that’s how retail traders trade the markets, but to trade profitably, you need to trade against the retail mindset. 
Step #5: After the upward spike, wait for the market to enter into a short period of consolidation or channeling. 
Usually, after the Dash cryptocurrency price had that last spike up the market will take a pause to digest the recent move, and it will start moving into a short period of consolidation or channeling. 
Simply, draw two parallel lines to contain this price range. 
Now, this is what we refer to as being the “Ledge.” 
The Spike and Ledge reversal pattern satisfies all trading conditions outlined above which mean that we can move forward and describe how to sell Dash coin. 
Step #6: Sell Dash coin when we break below the Ledge 
A short trade is entered on the breakout of the Ledge. 
This is an easy entry method, but in order to avoid the short-term noise and the usual false breakouts, we need also to wait for the breakout candle to close below the Ledge. 
Step #7: Place your protective Stop Loss above the Exhaustion bar 
The initial protective stop loss is placed on the other side of the reversal pattern. 
You hide your stop loss above the exhaustion bar. 
Step #8: Your Take Profit needs to be two or three times bigger than your risk aka your stop loss. 
As a general rule, you do want your take profit to be bigger than your stop loss. This is very important to your long-term survival in this business. 
However, you can achieve your profit target goals by using your preferred strategy when it comes to exit the market. We encourage you to experiment different exit strategies and see which one yields better results. 
Note** the above was an example of a SELL trade using our favorite Dash strategy. Use the same rules for a BUY trade – but in reverse.

Nov 21, 2017




I tried to make a good reflection of the whole cryptomarket. I only could do this with coins that been trading for more than a year. Otherwise the chart did not work. So I made a chart with the following coins: 
BTC -0.81% , ETH, XRP, LTC, DASH, NEO, MONERO,  XEM -1.35% 

If people also wanna chart on this chart use the following ticker: 
COINBASE:BTCUSD*16692550+BITFINEX:ETHUSD*92862174+BITTREX:XRPUSD*38622892459+BITFINEX:LTCUSD*53927233+BITTREX:DASHUSD*7701656+BITTREX:NEOUSD*65000000+BITTREX:XMRUSD*15377976+BITTREX:XEMUSD*8999999999 

About the charts 
The first chart you see is on the logic alghoritme. The second one in normal view. 

On the first alghoritme we see a big rising wedge! On the second one you see the beautifull elliot-wave pattern. The 5th wave or 3th wave up reached the 1.618 fibonacci level, the same level als the last crash.  

I think there could be an abc-correction wave. With a total retracement of the whole cryptocurrancy market of 35-55%. 

Some other information to think about. Correct me when i'm wrong! 
First crash:  
-20 june the total marketcap of cryptocurrancies was 115 million.  
-16 july the total marketcap of cryptocurrancies 67 million  

Trigger: The first  bitcoin -0.81%  fork?  

Second crash:  
-1 september the total marketcap of cryptocurrancies was 174 million.  
-15 september the total marketcap of cryptocurrancies was 109 million.  

Trigger: China Ban?  

The last and upcomming crash>  
It should be time for a correction of the total market! I think there is a huge change.  

Trigger: I really think the Tether usd hack could trigger a crash.  

Last thing I want to say, I try to do an objective view. I believe it will happen. You don't have to agree with me, take your own conclusion!

The bitcoin dominance is 56%. So the total marketcap of the other coins should be 44%. 

Total marketcap: 54.000.000.000 / 44% = 122.727.000.000 usd 
Bitcoin: 122.727.000.000 - 54.000.000.000 = 68.727.000.000 usd

Technical analysis: 
DASH/DOLLAR is in a range bound and beginning of up trend is expected.  
The price is below the 21-Day WEMA which acts as a dynamic resistance.  
The  RSI  is at 47.  

Trading suggestion: 
The price is in a range bound, but we forecast the uptrend would begin.  
There is possibility of temporary retracement to suggested  support zone  (417 to 281), if so, traders can set orders based on Daily-Trading-Opportunities and expect to reach short-term targets.  

Beginning of entry zone (417)  
Ending of entry zone (281)  

Entry signal: 
Signal to enter the market occurs when the price comes to ""Buy zone"" then forms one of the reversal patterns, whether ""Bullish Engulfing"", ""Hammer"" or ""Valley"", in other words,  
NO entry signal when the price comes to the zone BUT after any of reversal patterns is formed in the zone.

Get ready to DASH when the dollar goes digital! 


Dash -2.06%  is one of my favourite altcoins with respect to crypto as a globally scalable currency instead of a flawed overbought asset or fancy network-platform disguised as a currency. 
Day trading in the ultra-short ranges along with wave traders and bandwagon enthusiasts may seem appealing to a ripoff alt coin, but when it comes to Dash, the bears may be devastated by the returns the bulls will brag about in the years to come. 

If any cryptocurrency is going to disrupt fiat forex and drop the world on its head, the chances are in favour of Dash. The only currency powerful enough to challenge Dash in a race will resemble the digital dollar, or literally be a BANKcoin/FEDcoin issued by the whales of central/retail banking. 
Gold 0.12%  and  silver -0.83%  are no longer used as a currency, or even as a backing-asset anymore. The only system on Earth hoarding  gold 0.12%  are the reserves, or industry players directly involved in the utilitarian usage of the metal. 
Backing a currency by the  gold 0.12%  standard is no longer what Planet Earth chooses to do with their matter. Fiat is now lubricating the cogs of finance and society, driving us forward into the future of money! 
Maybe even the martians understand the benefits of a digital dollar or even Dash over the illusion of metallic gold? 

My positions still remain the same from 2018 - 2020: 
Dash is basically Litecoin 2.0 and  Bitcoin -0.81%  3.0 

1.  Bitcoin -0.66%  is an awesome historic asset, not a viable global currency. (LONG) 
2.  Bitcoin Cash -2.62%  is a sham, and worth less than the pixels of this text you are reading (0.0). (DUMP) 
3.  Ethereum -0.24% may be shorted heavily in June for  BTC -0.66%  but is still a really cool network-platform! (LONG) 
4.  Litecoin -1.70%  is kind of a sham as well...Repeat the mistakes of  Bitcoin -0.81% , pump it up and hope nobody finds out before it is too late! (DUMP) 
5.  Eos -5.27%  is pretty cool as well! An innovative platform with room to grow, but not a true cryptocurrency (LONG) 
6.  Dash -2.06%  is the star of the show, and the reason for this chart. No other crypto is positioned in the market to scale globally as big as Dash is! (LONG) 

I will probably chart all of the cryptos I discussed to go into details on each, and clarify what my projections and positions are currently. 
With a future so bright and a fresh cryptocurrency ready to visit the moon, why would I want to short so early and lose out? 
If you miss out on the small pop & drop, keep tuned for market moves over the next few months. 
We live in an amazing world, and I am very excited for what tomorrow holds!

I tried to make a good reflection of the whole cryptomarket. I only could do this with coins that been trading for more than a year. Otherwise the chart did not work. So I made a chart with the following coins:

About the charts 
The first chart you see is on the logic alghoritme. The second one in normal view. 

On the first alghoritme we see a big rising wedge! On the second one you see the beautifull elliot-wave pattern. The 5th wave or 3th wave up reached the 1.618 fibonacci level, the same level als the last crash.  

I think there could be an abc-correction wave. With a total retracement of the whole cryptocurrancy market of 35-55%. 

Some other information to think about. Correct me when i'm wrong! 
First crash:  
-20 june the total marketcap of cryptocurrancies was 115 million.  
-16 july the total marketcap of cryptocurrancies 67 million  

Trigger: The first  bitcoin -0.81%  fork?  

Second crash:

-15 september the total marketcap of cryptocurrancies was 109 million.  

Trigger: China Ban?

The bitcoin dominance is 56%. So the total marketcap of the other coins should be 44%. 

Total marketcap: 54.000.000.000 / 44% = 122.727.000.000 usd 
Bitcoin: 122.727.000.000 - 54.000.000.000 = 68.727.000.000 usd

Get ready to DASH when the dollar goes digital! 


Dash -2.06%  is one of my favourite altcoins with respect to crypto as a globally scalable currency instead of a flawed overbought asset or fancy network-platform disguised as a currency. 
Day trading in the ultra-short ranges along with wave traders and bandwagon enthusiasts may seem appealing to a ripoff alt coin, but when it comes to Dash, the bears may be devastated by the returns the bulls will brag about in the years to come. 

If any cryptocurrency is going to disrupt fiat forex and drop the world on its head, the chances are in favour of Dash. The only currency powerful enough to challenge Dash in a race will resemble the digital dollar, or literally be a BANKcoin/FEDcoin issued by the whales of central/retail banking. 
Gold 0.15%  and  silver -0.95%  are no longer used as a currency, or even as a backing-asset anymore. The only system on Earth hoarding  gold 0.15%  are the reserves, or industry players directly involved in the utilitarian usage of the metal. 
Backing a currency by the  gold 0.15%  standard is no longer what Planet Earth chooses to do with their matter. Fiat is now lubricating the cogs of finance and society, driving us forward into the future of money! 
Maybe even the martians understand the benefits of a digital dollar or even Dash over the illusion of metallic gold? 

My positions still remain the same from 2018 - 2020: 
Dash is basically Litecoin 2.0 and  Bitcoin -0.81%  3.0 

1.  Bitcoin -0.69%  is an awesome historic asset, not a viable global currency. (LONG) 
2.  Bitcoin Cash -2.68%  is a sham, and worth less than the pixels of this text you are reading (0.0). (DUMP) 
3.  Ethereum -0.24% may be shorted heavily in June for  BTC -0.69%  but is still a really cool network-platform! (LONG) 
4.  Litecoin -1.70%  is kind of a sham as well...Repeat the mistakes of  Bitcoin -0.81% , pump it up and hope nobody finds out before it is too late! (DUMP) 
5.  Eos -5.31%  is pretty cool as well! An innovative platform with room to grow, but not a true cryptocurrency (LONG) 
6.  Dash -2.06%  is the star of the show, and the reason for this chart. No other crypto is positioned in the market to scale globally as big as Dash is! (LONG) 

I will probably chart all of the cryptos I discussed to go into details on each, and clarify what my projections and positions are currently. 
With a future so bright and a fresh cryptocurrency ready to visit the moon, why would I want to short so early and lose out? 
If you miss out on the small pop & drop, keep tuned for market moves over the next few months. 
We live in an amazing world, and I am very excited for what tomorrow holds!

Comment:
					I also want to add that I am not paid by ANYBODY to market or shill/pitch their products. My charts are backed by where my investments are or where my head is at. 

If I make a call that a project is doomed, it is not because I want to crash the market price for revenge, or to trick others into handing me their crypto at rock-bottom prices. 

It is because I want to get a timestamp next to my ideas, to come back down the road later and see how my investments line up with the progress of the crypto industry overall. 

If someone pays me to peddle their coin to my TV followers/readers, I will make it extremely clear I have an incentive for my opinions outside of what I am already invested in.

404,1528431622.0,Procinctu,Bollinger Band Squeeze: Will Volatility pick up on DASH?,"
DASH has been fairly stagnant over the last few days. On several time frames, conditions for a  Bollinger Band  Squeeze are met. 

You can visibly see on the chart that the bands are contracting. Another thing you want to look for is the  Bollinger Band  Width. On a daily, many look for a 6 month low for the squeeze to be in play. 

As this is the 4 hour chart, the equivalent of 30 days would be about the same amount of candles as if it were a  daily chart . Interestingly, that last time the  Bollinger Band  Width was THIS low, was just before the big Crypto run up in late 2017. 

I don't know that the same kind of  volatility  from 2017 will come in just yet....but the probability is increased that some form of  volatility  can be expected...in either direction, up or down.

407,1527710414.0,Tradingstrategyguides,DASH SPIKE & LEDGE REVERSAL CRYPTO STRATEGY,"




May 30




Step #1: Dash cryptocurrency price needs to show a steady rise that suddenly accelerates to the upside. 
When this reversal pattern is complete, it will resemble a cup with a sharp bottom. 
This sharp acceleration usually is the last stage of a bull cryptocurrency market, and it’s followed by a sharp reversal if all the trading criteria for a valid Spike and Ledge are met. 
In  technical analysis , professional traders also refer to this last spike as being an exhaustion reversal bar that has a high probability of signaling a reversal in the Dash price. 
Now, before we can trade successfully, we need to understand that this key climax reversal bar needs to follow specific trading rules. 
More specifically, this exhaustion reversal bar needs to follow three rules, which we’re going to highlight next. 
Step #2: The exhaustion reversal bar needs to be bigger than the previous bar 
Relatively speaking the exhaustion bar, which should be the last bar within the downtrend, needs to be bigger than the previous bars. However, this is not mandatory. 
Ideally, the bigger the climax bar is in comparison with the other bars within the  bullish trend , the more profitable the reversal pattern becomes. 
Step #3: The climax bar needs to develop at a key sup/res level or after breaking a key swing low/high 
We can’t stress enough the importance of location in trading. 
Many times you’ll notice that a chart pattern will fail, but that’s not because that price pattern has stopped working. It’s often the case that you don’t have the patience for these patterns to develop at the right location. 
In order for the Dash cryptocurrency trading strategy to work we need to wait for the exhaustion bar to show up at the right location. 
Step #4: The exhaustion bar develops after several  bullish  impulsive bars 
We need to make sure that the exhaustion bar occurs after several  bullish  impulsive bars. 
These impulsive  bullish  bars will make the appearance of a  bullish trend  that will trap many sellers once the tide turns. And that’s how retail traders trade the markets, but to trade profitably, you need to trade against the retail mindset. 
Step #5: After the upward spike, wait for the market to enter into a short period of consolidation or channeling. 
Usually, after the Dash cryptocurrency price had that last spike up the market will take a pause to digest the recent move, and it will start moving into a short period of consolidation or channeling. 
Simply, draw two parallel lines to contain this price range. 
Now, this is what we refer to as being the “Ledge.” 
The Spike and Ledge reversal pattern satisfies all trading conditions outlined above which mean that we can move forward and describe how to sell Dash coin. 
Step #6: Sell Dash coin when we break below the Ledge 
A short trade is entered on the breakout of the Ledge. 
This is an easy entry method, but in order to avoid the short-term noise and the usual false breakouts, we need also to wait for the breakout candle to close below the Ledge. 
Step #7: Place your protective Stop Loss above the Exhaustion bar 
The initial protective stop loss is placed on the other side of the reversal pattern. 
You hide your stop loss above the exhaustion bar. 
Step #8: Your Take Profit needs to be two or three times bigger than your risk aka your stop loss. 
As a general rule, you do want your take profit to be bigger than your stop loss. This is very important to your long-term survival in this business. 
However, you can achieve your profit target goals by using your preferred strategy when it comes to exit the market. We encourage you to experiment different exit strategies and see which one yields better results. 
Note** the above was an example of a SELL trade using our favorite Dash strategy. Use the same rules for a BUY trade – but in reverse.

409,1528131496.0,FX_Academy,Dash (DASH/USD) still in a correction ,"
The price of Dash has retraced to the starting point of an impulse wave, which discards the possibility that the first upside impulse was a wave 1 from a larger degree, because if that was the case wave 2 couldn't retrace 100% as the price did. So we are seeing another corrective wave and it's likely going to be a Y wave from a WXY correction in the opposite direction from the massive  ABC  move we saw prior. That would all mean that another down move is coming after the Y ends on the upside.

If any cryptocurrency is going to disrupt fiat forex and drop the world on its head, the chances are in favour of Dash. The only currency powerful enough to challenge Dash in a race will resemble the digital dollar, or literally be a BANKcoin/FEDcoin issued by the whales of central/retail banking. 
Gold 0.16%  and  silver -0.77%  are no longer used as a currency, or even as a backing-asset anymore. The only system on Earth hoarding  gold 0.16%  are the reserves, or industry players directly involved in the utilitarian usage of the metal. 
Backing a currency by the  gold 0.16%  standard is no longer what Planet Earth chooses to do with their matter. Fiat is now lubricating the cogs of finance and society, driving us forward into the future of money! 
Maybe even the martians understand the benefits of a digital dollar or even Dash over the illusion of metallic gold? 

My positions still remain the same from 2018 - 2020: 
Dash is basically Litecoin 2.0 and  Bitcoin -0.82%  3.0 

1.  Bitcoin -0.69%  is an awesome historic asset, not a viable global currency. (LONG) 
2.  Bitcoin Cash -2.72%  is a sham, and worth less than the pixels of this text you are reading (0.0). (DUMP) 
3.  Ethereum -0.24% may be shorted heavily in June for  BTC -0.69%  but is still a really cool network-platform! (LONG) 
4.  Litecoin -1.70%  is kind of a sham as well...Repeat the mistakes of  Bitcoin -0.82% , pump it up and hope nobody finds out before it is too late! (DUMP) 
5.  Eos -5.38%  is pretty cool as well! An innovative platform with room to grow, but not a true cryptocurrency (LONG) 
6.  Dash -2.17%  is the star of the show, and the reason for this chart. No other crypto is positioned in the market to scale globally as big as Dash is! (LONG) 

I will probably chart all of the cryptos I discussed to go into details on each, and clarify what my projections and positions are currently. 
With a future so bright and a fresh cryptocurrency ready to visit the moon, why would I want to short so early and lose out? 
If you miss out on the small pop & drop, keep tuned for market moves over the next few months. 
We live in an amazing world, and I am very excited for what tomorrow holds!

DASH has been fairly stagnant over the last few days. On several time frames, conditions for a  Bollinger Band  Squeeze are met. 

You can visibly see on the chart that the bands are contracting. Another thing you want to look for is the  Bollinger Band  Width. On a daily, many look for a 6 month low for the squeeze to be in play. 

As this is the 4 hour chart, the equivalent of 30 days would be about the same amount of candles as if it were a  daily chart . Interestingly, that last time the  Bollinger Band  Width was THIS low, was just before the big Crypto run up in late 2017.

May 30




Step #1: Dash cryptocurrency price needs to show a steady rise that suddenly accelerates to the upside. 
When this reversal pattern is complete, it will resemble a cup with a sharp bottom. 
This sharp acceleration usually is the last stage of a bull cryptocurrency market, and it’s followed by a sharp reversal if all the trading criteria for a valid Spike and Ledge are met. 
In  technical analysis , professional traders also refer to this last spike as being an exhaustion reversal bar that has a high probability of signaling a reversal in the Dash price. 
Now, before we can trade successfully, we need to understand that this key climax reversal bar needs to follow specific trading rules. 
More specifically, this exhaustion reversal bar needs to follow three rules, which we’re going to highlight next. 
Step #2: The exhaustion reversal bar needs to be bigger than the previous bar 
Relatively speaking the exhaustion bar, which should be the last bar within the downtrend, needs to be bigger than the previous bars. However, this is not mandatory. 
Ideally, the bigger the climax bar is in comparison with the other bars within the  bullish trend , the more profitable the reversal pattern becomes. 
Step #3: The climax bar needs to develop at a key sup/res level or after breaking a key swing low/high 
We can’t stress enough the importance of location in trading. 
Many times you’ll notice that a chart pattern will fail, but that’s not because that price pattern has stopped working. It’s often the case that you don’t have the patience for these patterns to develop at the right location. 
In order for the Dash cryptocurrency trading strategy to work we need to wait for the exhaustion bar to show up at the right location. 
Step #4: The exhaustion bar develops after several  bullish  impulsive bars 
We need to make sure that the exhaustion bar occurs after several  bullish  impulsive bars. 
These impulsive  bullish  bars will make the appearance of a  bullish trend  that will trap many sellers once the tide turns. And that’s how retail traders trade the markets, but to trade profitably, you need to trade against the retail mindset. 
Step #5: After the upward spike, wait for the market to enter into a short period of consolidation or channeling. 
Usually, after the Dash cryptocurrency price had that last spike up the market will take a pause to digest the recent move, and it will start moving into a short period of consolidation or channeling. 
Simply, draw two parallel lines to contain this price range. 
Now, this is what we refer to as being the “Ledge.” 
The Spike and Ledge reversal pattern satisfies all trading conditions outlined above which mean that we can move forward and describe how to sell Dash coin. 
Step #6: Sell Dash coin when we break below the Ledge 
A short trade is entered on the breakout of the Ledge. 
This is an easy entry method, but in order to avoid the short-term noise and the usual false breakouts, we need also to wait for the breakout candle to close below the Ledge. 
Step #7: Place your protective Stop Loss above the Exhaustion bar 
The initial protective stop loss is placed on the other side of the reversal pattern. 
You hide your stop loss above the exhaustion bar. 
Step #8: Your Take Profit needs to be two or three times bigger than your risk aka your stop loss. 
As a general rule, you do want your take profit to be bigger than your stop loss. This is very important to your long-term survival in this business. 
However, you can achieve your profit target goals by using your preferred strategy when it comes to exit the market. We encourage you to experiment different exit strategies and see which one yields better results. 
Note** the above was an example of a SELL trade using our favorite Dash strategy. Use the same rules for a BUY trade – but in reverse.

The price of Dash has retraced to the starting point of an impulse wave, which discards the possibility that the first upside impulse was a wave 1 from a larger degree, because if that was the case wave 2 couldn't retrace 100% as the price did. So we are seeing another corrective wave and it's likely going to be a Y wave from a WXY correction in the opposite direction from the massive  ABC  move we saw prior. That would all mean that another down move is coming after the Y ends on the upside.

Nov 21, 2017




I tried to make a good reflection of the whole cryptomarket. I only could do this with coins that been trading for more than a year. Otherwise the chart did not work. So I made a chart with the following coins: 
BTC -0.82% , ETH, XRP, LTC, DASH, NEO, MONERO,  XEM -1.35% 

If people also wanna chart on this chart use the following ticker: 
COINBASE:BTCUSD*16692550+BITFINEX:ETHUSD*92862174+BITTREX:XRPUSD*38622892459+BITFINEX:LTCUSD*53927233+BITTREX:DASHUSD*7701656+BITTREX:NEOUSD*65000000+BITTREX:XMRUSD*15377976+BITTREX:XEMUSD*8999999999 

About the charts 
The first chart you see is on the logic alghoritme. The second one in normal view. 

On the first alghoritme we see a big rising wedge! On the second one you see the beautifull elliot-wave pattern. The 5th wave or 3th wave up reached the 1.618 fibonacci level, the same level als the last crash.  

I think there could be an abc-correction wave. With a total retracement of the whole cryptocurrancy market of 35-55%. 

Some other information to think about. Correct me when i'm wrong! 
First crash:  
-20 june the total marketcap of cryptocurrancies was 115 million.  
-16 july the total marketcap of cryptocurrancies 67 million  

Trigger: The first  bitcoin -0.82%  fork?  

Second crash:  
-1 september the total marketcap of cryptocurrancies was 174 million.  
-15 september the total marketcap of cryptocurrancies was 109 million.  

Trigger: China Ban?  

The last and upcomming crash>  
It should be time for a correction of the total market! I think there is a huge change.  

Trigger: I really think the Tether usd hack could trigger a crash.  

Last thing I want to say, I try to do an objective view. I believe it will happen. You don't have to agree with me, take your own conclusion!

The bitcoin dominance is 56%. So the total marketcap of the other coins should be 44%. 

Total marketcap: 54.000.000.000 / 44% = 122.727.000.000 usd 
Bitcoin: 122.727.000.000 - 54.000.000.000 = 68.727.000.000 usd 

So the bitcoin should multiplied by 68.727.000.000 / 138.000.000.000 = 50%

Technical analysis: 
DASH/DOLLAR is in a range bound and beginning of up trend is expected.  
The price is below the 21-Day WEMA which acts as a dynamic resistance.  
The  RSI  is at 47.  

Trading suggestion: 
The price is in a range bound, but we forecast the uptrend would begin.  
There is possibility of temporary retracement to suggested  support zone  (417 to 281), if so, traders can set orders based on Daily-Trading-Opportunities and expect to reach short-term targets.  

Beginning of entry zone (417)  
Ending of entry zone (281)  

Entry signal: 
Signal to enter the market occurs when the price comes to ""Buy zone"" then forms one of the reversal patterns, whether ""Bullish Engulfing"", ""Hammer"" or ""Valley"", in other words,  
NO entry signal when the price comes to the zone BUT after any of reversal patterns is formed in the zone.

The bitcoin dominance is 56%. So the total marketcap of the other coins should be 44%. 

Total marketcap: 54.000.000.000 / 44% = 122.727.000.000 usd 
Bitcoin: 122.727.000.000 - 54.000.000.000 = 68.727.000.000 usd 

So the bitcoin should multiplied by 68.727.000.000 / 138.000.000.000 = 50%

Get ready to DASH when the dollar goes digital! 


Dash -2.07%  is one of my favourite altcoins with respect to crypto as a globally scalable currency instead of a flawed overbought asset or fancy network-platform disguised as a currency. 
Day trading in the ultra-short ranges along with wave traders and bandwagon enthusiasts may seem appealing to a ripoff alt coin, but when it comes to Dash, the bears may be devastated by the returns the bulls will brag about in the years to come. 

If any cryptocurrency is going to disrupt fiat forex and drop the world on its head, the chances are in favour of Dash. The only currency powerful enough to challenge Dash in a race will resemble the digital dollar, or literally be a BANKcoin/FEDcoin issued by the whales of central/retail banking. 
Gold 0.17%  and  silver -0.95%  are no longer used as a currency, or even as a backing-asset anymore. The only system on Earth hoarding  gold 0.17%  are the reserves, or industry players directly involved in the utilitarian usage of the metal. 
Backing a currency by the  gold 0.17%  standard is no longer what Planet Earth chooses to do with their matter. Fiat is now lubricating the cogs of finance and society, driving us forward into the future of money! 
Maybe even the martians understand the benefits of a digital dollar or even Dash over the illusion of metallic gold? 

My positions still remain the same from 2018 - 2020: 
Dash is basically Litecoin 2.0 and  Bitcoin -0.82%  3.0 

1.  Bitcoin -0.71%  is an awesome historic asset, not a viable global currency. (LONG) 
2.  Bitcoin Cash -2.72%  is a sham, and worth less than the pixels of this text you are reading (0.0). (DUMP) 
3.  Ethereum -0.23% may be shorted heavily in June for  BTC -0.71%  but is still a really cool network-platform! (LONG) 
4.  Litecoin -1.71%  is kind of a sham as well...Repeat the mistakes of  Bitcoin -0.82% , pump it up and hope nobody finds out before it is too late! (DUMP) 
5.  Eos -5.37%  is pretty cool as well! An innovative platform with room to grow, but not a true cryptocurrency (LONG) 
6.  Dash -2.07%  is the star of the show, and the reason for this chart. No other crypto is positioned in the market to scale globally as big as Dash is! (LONG) 

I will probably chart all of the cryptos I discussed to go into details on each, and clarify what my projections and positions are currently. 
With a future so bright and a fresh cryptocurrency ready to visit the moon, why would I want to short so early and lose out? 
If you miss out on the small pop & drop, keep tuned for market moves over the next few months. 
We live in an amazing world, and I am very excited for what tomorrow holds!

Comment:
					I also want to add that I am not paid by ANYBODY to market or shill/pitch their products. My charts are backed by where my investments are or where my head is at. 

If I make a call that a project is doomed, it is not because I want to crash the market price for revenge, or to trick others into handing me their crypto at rock-bottom prices. 

It is because I want to get a timestamp next to my ideas, to come back down the road later and see how my investments line up with the progress of the crypto industry overall. 

If someone pays me to peddle their coin to my TV followers/readers, I will make it extremely clear I have an incentive for my opinions outside of what I am already invested in.

458,1528431622.0,Procinctu,Bollinger Band Squeeze: Will Volatility pick up on DASH?,"
DASH has been fairly stagnant over the last few days. On several time frames, conditions for a  Bollinger Band  Squeeze are met. 

You can visibly see on the chart that the bands are contracting. Another thing you want to look for is the  Bollinger Band  Width. On a daily, many look for a 6 month low for the squeeze to be in play. 

As this is the 4 hour chart, the equivalent of 30 days would be about the same amount of candles as if it were a  daily chart . Interestingly, that last time the  Bollinger Band  Width was THIS low, was just before the big Crypto run up in late 2017. 

I don't know that the same kind of  volatility  from 2017 will come in just yet....but the probability is increased that some form of  volatility  can be expected...in either direction, up or down.

461,1527710414.0,Tradingstrategyguides,DASH SPIKE & LEDGE REVERSAL CRYPTO STRATEGY,"




May 30




Step #1: Dash cryptocurrency price needs to show a steady rise that suddenly accelerates to the upside. 
When this reversal pattern is complete, it will resemble a cup with a sharp bottom. 
This sharp acceleration usually is the last stage of a bull cryptocurrency market, and it’s followed by a sharp reversal if all the trading criteria for a valid Spike and Ledge are met. 
In  technical analysis , professional traders also refer to this last spike as being an exhaustion reversal bar that has a high probability of signaling a reversal in the Dash price. 
Now, before we can trade successfully, we need to understand that this key climax reversal bar needs to follow specific trading rules. 
More specifically, this exhaustion reversal bar needs to follow three rules, which we’re going to highlight next. 
Step #2: The exhaustion reversal bar needs to be bigger than the previous bar 
Relatively speaking the exhaustion bar, which should be the last bar within the downtrend, needs to be bigger than the previous bars. However, this is not mandatory. 
Ideally, the bigger the climax bar is in comparison with the other bars within the  bullish trend , the more profitable the reversal pattern becomes. 
Step #3: The climax bar needs to develop at a key sup/res level or after breaking a key swing low/high 
We can’t stress enough the importance of location in trading. 
Many times you’ll notice that a chart pattern will fail, but that’s not because that price pattern has stopped working. It’s often the case that you don’t have the patience for these patterns to develop at the right location. 
In order for the Dash cryptocurrency trading strategy to work we need to wait for the exhaustion bar to show up at the right location. 
Step #4: The exhaustion bar develops after several  bullish  impulsive bars 
We need to make sure that the exhaustion bar occurs after several  bullish  impulsive bars. 
These impulsive  bullish  bars will make the appearance of a  bullish trend  that will trap many sellers once the tide turns. And that’s how retail traders trade the markets, but to trade profitably, you need to trade against the retail mindset. 
Step #5: After the upward spike, wait for the market to enter into a short period of consolidation or channeling. 
Usually, after the Dash cryptocurrency price had that last spike up the market will take a pause to digest the recent move, and it will start moving into a short period of consolidation or channeling. 
Simply, draw two parallel lines to contain this price range. 
Now, this is what we refer to as being the “Ledge.” 
The Spike and Ledge reversal pattern satisfies all trading conditions outlined above which mean that we can move forward and describe how to sell Dash coin. 
Step #6: Sell Dash coin when we break below the Ledge 
A short trade is entered on the breakout of the Ledge. 
This is an easy entry method, but in order to avoid the short-term noise and the usual false breakouts, we need also to wait for the breakout candle to close below the Ledge. 
Step #7: Place your protective Stop Loss above the Exhaustion bar 
The initial protective stop loss is placed on the other side of the reversal pattern. 
You hide your stop loss above the exhaustion bar. 
Step #8: Your Take Profit needs to be two or three times bigger than your risk aka your stop loss. 
As a general rule, you do want your take profit to be bigger than your stop loss. This is very important to your long-term survival in this business. 
However, you can achieve your profit target goals by using your preferred strategy when it comes to exit the market. We encourage you to experiment different exit strategies and see which one yields better results. 
Note** the above was an example of a SELL trade using our favorite Dash strategy. Use the same rules for a BUY trade – but in reverse.

Get ready to DASH when the dollar goes digital! 


Dash -2.08%  is one of my favourite altcoins with respect to crypto as a globally scalable currency instead of a flawed overbought asset or fancy network-platform disguised as a currency. 
Day trading in the ultra-short ranges along with wave traders and bandwagon enthusiasts may seem appealing to a ripoff alt coin, but when it comes to Dash, the bears may be devastated by the returns the bulls will brag about in the years to come. 

If any cryptocurrency is going to disrupt fiat forex and drop the world on its head, the chances are in favour of Dash. The only currency powerful enough to challenge Dash in a race will resemble the digital dollar, or literally be a BANKcoin/FEDcoin issued by the whales of central/retail banking. 
Gold 0.18%  and  silver -0.77%  are no longer used as a currency, or even as a backing-asset anymore. The only system on Earth hoarding  gold 0.18%  are the reserves, or industry players directly involved in the utilitarian usage of the metal. 
Backing a currency by the  gold 0.18%  standard is no longer what Planet Earth chooses to do with their matter. Fiat is now lubricating the cogs of finance and society, driving us forward into the future of money! 
Maybe even the martians understand the benefits of a digital dollar or even Dash over the illusion of metallic gold? 

My positions still remain the same from 2018 - 2020: 
Dash is basically Litecoin 2.0 and  Bitcoin -0.83%  3.0 

1.  Bitcoin -0.71%  is an awesome historic asset, not a viable global currency. (LONG) 
2.  Bitcoin Cash -2.72%  is a sham, and worth less than the pixels of this text you are reading (0.0). (DUMP) 
3.  Ethereum -0.21% may be shorted heavily in June for  BTC -0.71%  but is still a really cool network-platform! (LONG) 
4.  Litecoin -1.65%  is kind of a sham as well...Repeat the mistakes of  Bitcoin -0.83% , pump it up and hope nobody finds out before it is too late! (DUMP) 
5.  Eos -5.31%  is pretty cool as well! An innovative platform with room to grow, but not a true cryptocurrency (LONG) 
6.  Dash -2.08%  is the star of the show, and the reason for this chart. No other crypto is positioned in the market to scale globally as big as Dash is! (LONG) 

I will probably chart all of the cryptos I discussed to go into details on each, and clarify what my projections and positions are currently. 
With a future so bright and a fresh cryptocurrency ready to visit the moon, why would I want to short so early and lose out? 
If you miss out on the small pop & drop, keep tuned for market moves over the next few months. 
We live in an amazing world, and I am very excited for what tomorrow holds!

DASH has been fairly stagnant over the last few days. On several time frames, conditions for a  Bollinger Band  Squeeze are met. 

You can visibly see on the chart that the bands are contracting. Another thing you want to look for is the  Bollinger Band  Width. On a daily, many look for a 6 month low for the squeeze to be in play. 

As this is the 4 hour chart, the equivalent of 30 days would be about the same amount of candles as if it were a  daily chart . Interestingly, that last time the  Bollinger Band  Width was THIS low, was just before the big Crypto run up in late 2017.

May 30




Step #1: Dash cryptocurrency price needs to show a steady rise that suddenly accelerates to the upside. 
When this reversal pattern is complete, it will resemble a cup with a sharp bottom. 
This sharp acceleration usually is the last stage of a bull cryptocurrency market, and it’s followed by a sharp reversal if all the trading criteria for a valid Spike and Ledge are met. 
In  technical analysis , professional traders also refer to this last spike as being an exhaustion reversal bar that has a high probability of signaling a reversal in the Dash price. 
Now, before we can trade successfully, we need to understand that this key climax reversal bar needs to follow specific trading rules. 
More specifically, this exhaustion reversal bar needs to follow three rules, which we’re going to highlight next. 
Step #2: The exhaustion reversal bar needs to be bigger than the previous bar 
Relatively speaking the exhaustion bar, which should be the last bar within the downtrend, needs to be bigger than the previous bars. However, this is not mandatory. 
Ideally, the bigger the climax bar is in comparison with the other bars within the  bullish trend , the more profitable the reversal pattern becomes. 
Step #3: The climax bar needs to develop at a key sup/res level or after breaking a key swing low/high 
We can’t stress enough the importance of location in trading. 
Many times you’ll notice that a chart pattern will fail, but that’s not because that price pattern has stopped working. It’s often the case that you don’t have the patience for these patterns to develop at the right location. 
In order for the Dash cryptocurrency trading strategy to work we need to wait for the exhaustion bar to show up at the right location. 
Step #4: The exhaustion bar develops after several  bullish  impulsive bars 
We need to make sure that the exhaustion bar occurs after several  bullish  impulsive bars. 
These impulsive  bullish  bars will make the appearance of a  bullish trend  that will trap many sellers once the tide turns. And that’s how retail traders trade the markets, but to trade profitably, you need to trade against the retail mindset. 
Step #5: After the upward spike, wait for the market to enter into a short period of consolidation or channeling. 
Usually, after the Dash cryptocurrency price had that last spike up the market will take a pause to digest the recent move, and it will start moving into a short period of consolidation or channeling. 
Simply, draw two parallel lines to contain this price range. 
Now, this is what we refer to as being the “Ledge.” 
The Spike and Ledge reversal pattern satisfies all trading conditions outlined above which mean that we can move forward and describe how to sell Dash coin. 
Step #6: Sell Dash coin when we break below the Ledge 
A short trade is entered on the breakout of the Ledge. 
This is an easy entry method, but in order to avoid the short-term noise and the usual false breakouts, we need also to wait for the breakout candle to close below the Ledge. 
Step #7: Place your protective Stop Loss above the Exhaustion bar 
The initial protective stop loss is placed on the other side of the reversal pattern. 
You hide your stop loss above the exhaustion bar. 
Step #8: Your Take Profit needs to be two or three times bigger than your risk aka your stop loss. 
As a general rule, you do want your take profit to be bigger than your stop loss. This is very important to your long-term survival in this business. 
However, you can achieve your profit target goals by using your preferred strategy when it comes to exit the market. We encourage you to experiment different exit strategies and see which one yields better results. 
Note** the above was an example of a SELL trade using our favorite Dash strategy. Use the same rules for a BUY trade – but in reverse.

481,1528131496.0,FX_Academy,Dash (DASH/USD) still in a correction ,"
The price of Dash has retraced to the starting point of an impulse wave, which discards the possibility that the first upside impulse was a wave 1 from a larger degree, because if that was the case wave 2 couldn't retrace 100% as the price did. So we are seeing another corrective wave and it's likely going to be a Y wave from a WXY correction in the opposite direction from the massive  ABC  move we saw prior. That would all mean that another down move is coming after the Y ends on the upside.

Nov 21, 2017




I tried to make a good reflection of the whole cryptomarket. I only could do this with coins that been trading for more than a year. Otherwise the chart did not work. So I made a chart with the following coins: 
BTC -0.84% , ETH, XRP, LTC, DASH, NEO, MONERO,  XEM -1.35% 

If people also wanna chart on this chart use the following ticker: 
COINBASE:BTCUSD*16692550+BITFINEX:ETHUSD*92862174+BITTREX:XRPUSD*38622892459+BITFINEX:LTCUSD*53927233+BITTREX:DASHUSD*7701656+BITTREX:NEOUSD*65000000+BITTREX:XMRUSD*15377976+BITTREX:XEMUSD*8999999999 

About the charts 
The first chart you see is on the logic alghoritme. The second one in normal view. 

On the first alghoritme we see a big rising wedge! On the second one you see the beautifull elliot-wave pattern. The 5th wave or 3th wave up reached the 1.618 fibonacci level, the same level als the last crash.  

I think there could be an abc-correction wave. With a total retracement of the whole cryptocurrancy market of 35-55%. 

Some other information to think about. Correct me when i'm wrong! 
First crash:  
-20 june the total marketcap of cryptocurrancies was 115 million.  
-16 july the total marketcap of cryptocurrancies 67 million  

Trigger: The first  bitcoin -0.84%  fork?  

Second crash:  
-1 september the total marketcap of cryptocurrancies was 174 million.  
-15 september the total marketcap of cryptocurrancies was 109 million.  

Trigger: China Ban?  

The last and upcomming crash>  
It should be time for a correction of the total market! I think there is a huge change.  

Trigger: I really think the Tether usd hack could trigger a crash.  

Last thing I want to say, I try to do an objective view. I believe it will happen. You don't have to agree with me, take your own conclusion!

The bitcoin dominance is 56%. So the total marketcap of the other coins should be 44%. 

Total marketcap: 54.000.000.000 / 44% = 122.727.000.000 usd 
Bitcoin: 122.727.000.000 - 54.000.000.000 = 68.727.000.000 usd 

So the bitcoin should multiplied by 68.727.000.000 / 138.000.000.000 = 50%

The price is in a range bound, but we forecast the uptrend would begin.  
There is possibility of temporary retracement to suggested  support zone  (417 to 281), if so, traders can set orders based on Daily-Trading-Opportunities and expect to reach short-term targets.

Step #4: The exhaustion bar develops after several  bullish  impulsive bars 
We need to make sure that the exhaustion bar occurs after several  bullish  impulsive bars. 
These impulsive  bullish  bars will make the appearance of a  bullish trend  that will trap many sellers once the tide turns. And that’s how retail traders trade the markets, but to trade profitably, you need to trade against the retail mindset. 
Step #5: After the upward spike, wait for the market to enter into a short period of consolidation or channeling. 
Usually, after the Dash cryptocurrency price had that last spike up the market will take a pause to digest the recent move, and it will start moving into a short period of consolidation or channeling. 
Simply, draw two parallel lines to contain this price range. 
Now, this is what we refer to as being the “Ledge.” 
The Spike and Ledge reversal pattern satisfies all trading conditions outlined above which mean that we can move forward and describe how to sell Dash coin. 
Step #6: Sell Dash coin when we break below the Ledge 
A short trade is entered on the breakout of the Ledge. 
This is an easy entry method, but in order to avoid the short-term noise and the usual false breakouts, we need also to wait for the breakout candle to close below the Ledge. 
Step #7: Place your protective Stop Loss above the Exhaustion bar 
The initial protective stop loss is placed on the other side of the reversal pattern. 
You hide your stop loss above the exhaustion bar. 
Step #8: Your Take Profit needs to be two or three times bigger than your risk aka your stop loss. 
As a general rule, you do want your take profit to be bigger than your stop loss. This is very important to your long-term survival in this business. 
However, you can achieve your profit target goals by using your preferred strategy when it comes to exit the market. We encourage you to experiment different exit strategies and see which one yields better results. 
Note** the above was an example of a SELL trade using our favorite Dash strategy. Use the same rules for a BUY trade – but in reverse.

The price of Dash has retraced to the starting point of an impulse wave, which discards the possibility that the first upside impulse was a wave 1 from a larger degree, because if that was the case wave 2 couldn't retrace 100% as the price did. So we are seeing another corrective wave and it's likely going to be a Y wave from a WXY correction in the opposite direction from the massive  ABC  move we saw prior. That would all mean that another down move is coming after the Y ends on the upside.

Big ups, Big downs, so is the way of DASH.  Here is the trajectory that I can see. two channels within a larger channel, with a huge potential range. This one can make you rich or filthy rich if it stays on path. Ill personally be holding this coin until 2020 and looking for some great trading opportunities along the way!
