And what I suspect in my last analyses (XRPUSD) is already happening in this coin, STRUSD.  

After falling outside the  Bollinger Bands  and touching the more critical 61.8%  Fibonacci retracement  level market is trying to stabilize. If market can maintain at least a close near the open (0.3100) then a return to the  Bollinger  midline becomes likely (0.3950 currently). 

Such action does not imply a turn in sentiment but rather coling off of short-term oversold conditions. 

Note that market has, in a wider view, retraced 38.2% of the entire downmove since the high posted at around 0.9500 at the start of 2018. Bulls task is again, as in other coins, to set a clear higher low to improve the overal picture.

 Stellar -3.32%  continues to move within the  descending channel  producing lower lows and lower highs. Trend remains  bearish  while price formed the low at $0.15.  

The most recent bounce of the upper  trendline  of the  descending channel  was on 28th of May and since then price has formed the resistance at 0.23. In order for STR/USD to start moving higher $0.23 resistance must be broken with a daily close above that price. 

It that happens,  Stellar -3.32%  is likely to start correcting upwards and potentially double in value, as the next strong resistance is seen at 88.6%  Fibonacci retracement , that is $0.44. 

On the other hand if resistance will be rejected, yet another wave down could be expected towards previously established low at $0.15 or a psychological support at $0.1

I love this coin and I hope It takes over XRP real soon. It looks like we are about finished with Wave 4 correction and currently in subwave 2 of greater wave 5 which has the potential to go above $1.00 or may be more. We are currently forming the handle of a Large cup formation. The handle can also be seen as the right shoulder of a large Inverted  H&S . The downside potential is 0.15c which will probably be in play if  BTC -1.72%  spoils the party (high probability). 

Good luck

					MACD has a bullish crossover happening on the daily. I am not a big fan of MACD but it is a buy signal for me. Also on the weekly we had a doji formation.

STELLAR/DOLLAR 4H 
DOUBLE BAR LOW HIGHER CLOSE PATTERN (DBLHC) 
What is  Stellar              Lumens? 
Stellar              is a platform that it’s trying to do very fast payments with very low fees. The key advantage of  Stellar              is that it has between 3 and 5 seconds confirmation time and it supports thousands of transactions per second. 
Stellar              Lumens price is below the $1 and trading at only a few cents, which makes  XLM              a top cryptocurrency under $1. 
Stellar              Cryptocurrency Strategy 
All we need for swing trading cryptocurrency is the Double Bar Low Higher Close pattern also known as the DBLHC pattern. 
All you need is to look for two bars that have equal lows or near the same price level. The second condition that needs to be satisfied for a valid DBLHC is that the second candle needs to close a lot higher than the first candle (see chart above). 
Usually, the bar tails are tiny, but the  candlestick  body is large. 
Step #1: Find a  bullish trend  or wait until the market develops a swing low 
The double bar low higher close can be found at the end of a  bearish trend  and the start of a new  bullish trend  acting as a reversal  bullish pattern . However, at the same time, the DBLHC is also a continuation pattern that can develop at any stage during a  bullish trend . 
Having a prior trend already established increases the probabilities of the DBLHC pattern to work. 
The DBLHC can produce the same kind of results even when the market is only in the process of establishing a market swing low. If a DBLHC develops right after a swing low is created that’s the confirmation we need that the institutional money is buying low. 
Step #2: Wait until the DBLHC chart pattern develops on the  Stellar             XLM              Chart 
Now that you’re familiarized with the DBLHC pattern, it should come easily to spot this powerful chart pattern on the  Stellar              chart. 
The DBLHC pattern has two identical lows and the second candle close is way higher than the high of the first candle. 
In most of the cases the first candle will be  bearish  followed by a second  bullish  candle, but as we can see the  Stellar              price action is developing a DBLHC were the first candle is also  bullish . This doesn’t invalidate the DBLHC chart pattern as in our books; it’s still a very tradeable chart pattern. 
Step #3: Buy at the market at the opening of the next candle after the DBLHC pattern 
When to buy  Stellar              is quite easy. As per the DBLHC pattern rules, we need to enter immediately at the market when the DBLHC has formed. Alternatively, we can place a buy limit order above the high of the second candle. 
Buying  Stellar              with our cryptocurrency buy strategy will offer you a high risk to reward ratio. 
The second advantage you have is that you’re buying  Stellar              right when the  bullish  momentum is starting to build up. Technically, this means that the price should never look back, which means that the drawdown should be minimal. 
Step #4: Place protective Stop Loss below the DBLHC low 
The DBLHC chart pattern also provides us with a great spot to hide your protective stop loss. 
Trading without a stop loss is the number one mistake that traders make. Make sure you always trade with a stop loss to protect your account balance. 
After you bought  XLM              coin, the protective stop loss can be placed below the DBLHC low. 
Step #5: Take Profit when we break below the up-sloping  trend line  that connects the swing low points 
The first thing we need to do when trading  Stellar              and you want to cash out some of your profits is to draw an up-sloping  trend line  starting from the swing low you identified in Step #1 and connect all the swing low points that are part of this new uptrend. 
As soon as  Stellar             XLM              price breaks and closes below the upward  trend line  you take profits. 
This take profit strategy will maximize your trading profits and it will keep you as long as the  bullish  momentum is strong. 
Note** the above was an example of a BUY trade using the  Stellar              cryptocurrency trading strategy. Use the same rules for a SELL trade – but in reverse.

StellarLumens has been in a  falling wedge  for months now. Falling  wedges  are a great buy opportunity  
because most of the time they will breakout when the price touches the  trend line  for the 5th time (ABCDE sequence). 
There has been a lot of hype around StellarLumens on social media which is also a great sign. 

Next to this the  MACD  had an  bullish  crossover which is a good sign.

 Stellar -3.32%  continues to move within the  descending channel  producing lower lows and lower highs. Trend remains  bearish  while price formed the low at $0.15.  

The most recent bounce of the upper  trendline  of the  descending channel  was on 28th of May and since then price has formed the resistance at 0.23. In order for STR/USD to start moving higher $0.23 resistance must be broken with a daily close above that price. 

It that happens,  Stellar -3.32%  is likely to start correcting upwards and potentially double in value, as the next strong resistance is seen at 88.6%  Fibonacci retracement , that is $0.44. 

On the other hand if resistance will be rejected, yet another wave down could be expected towards previously established low at $0.15 or a psychological support at $0.1

I love this coin and I hope It takes over XRP real soon. It looks like we are about finished with Wave 4 correction and currently in subwave 2 of greater wave 5 which has the potential to go above $1.00 or may be more. We are currently forming the handle of a Large cup formation. The handle can also be seen as the right shoulder of a large Inverted  H&S . The downside potential is 0.15c which will probably be in play if  BTC -1.72%  spoils the party (high probability). 

Good luck

STELLAR/DOLLAR 4H 
DOUBLE BAR LOW HIGHER CLOSE PATTERN (DBLHC) 
What is  Stellar              Lumens? 
Stellar              is a platform that it’s trying to do very fast payments with very low fees. The key advantage of  Stellar              is that it has between 3 and 5 seconds confirmation time and it supports thousands of transactions per second. 
Stellar              Lumens price is below the $1 and trading at only a few cents, which makes  XLM              a top cryptocurrency under $1. 
Stellar              Cryptocurrency Strategy 
All we need for swing trading cryptocurrency is the Double Bar Low Higher Close pattern also known as the DBLHC pattern. 
All you need is to look for two bars that have equal lows or near the same price level. The second condition that needs to be satisfied for a valid DBLHC is that the second candle needs to close a lot higher than the first candle (see chart above). 
Usually, the bar tails are tiny, but the  candlestick  body is large. 
Step #1: Find a  bullish trend  or wait until the market develops a swing low 
The double bar low higher close can be found at the end of a  bearish trend  and the start of a new  bullish trend  acting as a reversal  bullish pattern . However, at the same time, the DBLHC is also a continuation pattern that can develop at any stage during a  bullish trend . 
Having a prior trend already established increases the probabilities of the DBLHC pattern to work. 
The DBLHC can produce the same kind of results even when the market is only in the process of establishing a market swing low. If a DBLHC develops right after a swing low is created that’s the confirmation we need that the institutional money is buying low. 
Step #2: Wait until the DBLHC chart pattern develops on the  Stellar             XLM              Chart 
Now that you’re familiarized with the DBLHC pattern, it should come easily to spot this powerful chart pattern on the  Stellar              chart. 
The DBLHC pattern has two identical lows and the second candle close is way higher than the high of the first candle. 
In most of the cases the first candle will be  bearish  followed by a second  bullish  candle, but as we can see the  Stellar              price action is developing a DBLHC were the first candle is also  bullish . This doesn’t invalidate the DBLHC chart pattern as in our books; it’s still a very tradeable chart pattern. 
Step #3: Buy at the market at the opening of the next candle after the DBLHC pattern 
When to buy  Stellar              is quite easy. As per the DBLHC pattern rules, we need to enter immediately at the market when the DBLHC has formed. Alternatively, we can place a buy limit order above the high of the second candle. 
Buying  Stellar              with our cryptocurrency buy strategy will offer you a high risk to reward ratio. 
The second advantage you have is that you’re buying  Stellar              right when the  bullish  momentum is starting to build up. Technically, this means that the price should never look back, which means that the drawdown should be minimal. 
Step #4: Place protective Stop Loss below the DBLHC low 
The DBLHC chart pattern also provides us with a great spot to hide your protective stop loss. 
Trading without a stop loss is the number one mistake that traders make. Make sure you always trade with a stop loss to protect your account balance. 
After you bought  XLM              coin, the protective stop loss can be placed below the DBLHC low. 
Step #5: Take Profit when we break below the up-sloping  trend line  that connects the swing low points 
The first thing we need to do when trading  Stellar              and you want to cash out some of your profits is to draw an up-sloping  trend line  starting from the swing low you identified in Step #1 and connect all the swing low points that are part of this new uptrend. 
As soon as  Stellar             XLM              price breaks and closes below the upward  trend line  you take profits. 
This take profit strategy will maximize your trading profits and it will keep you as long as the  bullish  momentum is strong. 
Note** the above was an example of a BUY trade using the  Stellar              cryptocurrency trading strategy. Use the same rules for a SELL trade – but in reverse.

StellarLumens has been in a  falling wedge  for months now. Falling  wedges  are a great buy opportunity  
because most of the time they will breakout when the price touches the  trend line  for the 5th time (ABCDE sequence). 
There has been a lot of hype around StellarLumens on social media which is also a great sign. 

Next to this the  MACD  had an  bullish  crossover which is a good sign.

And what I suspect in my last analyses (XRPUSD) is already happening in this coin, STRUSD.  

After falling outside the  Bollinger Bands  and touching the more critical 61.8%  Fibonacci retracement  level market is trying to stabilize. If market can maintain at least a close near the open (0.3100) then a return to the  Bollinger  midline becomes likely (0.3950 currently). 

Such action does not imply a turn in sentiment but rather coling off of short-term oversold conditions. 

Note that market has, in a wider view, retraced 38.2% of the entire downmove since the high posted at around 0.9500 at the start of 2018. Bulls task is again, as in other coins, to set a clear higher low to improve the overal picture.

 Stellar -3.32%  continues to move within the  descending channel  producing lower lows and lower highs. Trend remains  bearish  while price formed the low at $0.15.  

The most recent bounce of the upper  trendline  of the  descending channel  was on 28th of May and since then price has formed the resistance at 0.23. In order for STR/USD to start moving higher $0.23 resistance must be broken with a daily close above that price. 

It that happens,  Stellar -3.32%  is likely to start correcting upwards and potentially double in value, as the next strong resistance is seen at 88.6%  Fibonacci retracement , that is $0.44. 

On the other hand if resistance will be rejected, yet another wave down could be expected towards previously established low at $0.15 or a psychological support at $0.1

Technical analysis: 
. STELLAR/DOLLAR is in a down trend and Beginning of up trend is expected.  
. The price is below the 21-Day WEMA which acts as a dynamic resistance.  
. The  RSI  is at 30.  

Trading suggestion: 
Although current trend is downtrend, but we forecast a uptrend wave would begin in Midterm. 
Price is in the Buy Zone (0.23 to 0.18), we would set orders based on Price Action and expect to reach short-term targets.  

. Beginning of entry zone (0.23)  
. Ending of entry zone (0.18)  

Entry signal: 
Signal to enter the market occurs when the price comes to ""Buy zone"" then forms one of the reversal patterns, whether ""Hammer"" or ""Trough"", in other words,  
NO entry signal when the price comes to the zone BUT after any of reversal patterns is formed in the zone.

I love this coin and I hope It takes over XRP real soon. It looks like we are about finished with Wave 4 correction and currently in subwave 2 of greater wave 5 which has the potential to go above $1.00 or may be more. We are currently forming the handle of a Large cup formation. The handle can also be seen as the right shoulder of a large Inverted  H&S . The downside potential is 0.15c which will probably be in play if  BTC -1.73%  spoils the party (high probability).

STELLAR/DOLLAR 4H 
DOUBLE BAR LOW HIGHER CLOSE PATTERN (DBLHC) 
What is  Stellar -3.32%  Lumens? 
Stellar -3.32%  is a platform that it’s trying to do very fast payments with very low fees. The key advantage of  Stellar -3.32%  is that it has between 3 and 5 seconds confirmation time and it supports thousands of transactions per second. 
Stellar -3.32%  Lumens price is below the $1 and trading at only a few cents, which makes  XLM              a top cryptocurrency under $1. 
Stellar -3.32%  Cryptocurrency Strategy 
All we need for swing trading cryptocurrency is the Double Bar Low Higher Close pattern also known as the DBLHC pattern. 
All you need is to look for two bars that have equal lows or near the same price level. The second condition that needs to be satisfied for a valid DBLHC is that the second candle needs to close a lot higher than the first candle (see chart above). 
Usually, the bar tails are tiny, but the  candlestick  body is large. 
Step #1: Find a  bullish trend  or wait until the market develops a swing low 
The double bar low higher close can be found at the end of a  bearish trend  and the start of a new  bullish trend  acting as a reversal  bullish pattern . However, at the same time, the DBLHC is also a continuation pattern that can develop at any stage during a  bullish trend . 
Having a prior trend already established increases the probabilities of the DBLHC pattern to work. 
The DBLHC can produce the same kind of results even when the market is only in the process of establishing a market swing low. If a DBLHC develops right after a swing low is created that’s the confirmation we need that the institutional money is buying low. 
Step #2: Wait until the DBLHC chart pattern develops on the  Stellar -3.32% XLM              Chart 
Now that you’re familiarized with the DBLHC pattern, it should come easily to spot this powerful chart pattern on the  Stellar -3.32%  chart. 
The DBLHC pattern has two identical lows and the second candle close is way higher than the high of the first candle. 
In most of the cases the first candle will be  bearish  followed by a second  bullish  candle, but as we can see the  Stellar -3.32%  price action is developing a DBLHC were the first candle is also  bullish . This doesn’t invalidate the DBLHC chart pattern as in our books; it’s still a very tradeable chart pattern. 
Step #3: Buy at the market at the opening of the next candle after the DBLHC pattern 
When to buy  Stellar -3.32%  is quite easy. As per the DBLHC pattern rules, we need to enter immediately at the market when the DBLHC has formed. Alternatively, we can place a buy limit order above the high of the second candle. 
Buying  Stellar -3.32%  with our cryptocurrency buy strategy will offer you a high risk to reward ratio. 
The second advantage you have is that you’re buying  Stellar -3.32%  right when the  bullish  momentum is starting to build up. Technically, this means that the price should never look back, which means that the drawdown should be minimal. 
Step #4: Place protective Stop Loss below the DBLHC low 
The DBLHC chart pattern also provides us with a great spot to hide your protective stop loss. 
Trading without a stop loss is the number one mistake that traders make. Make sure you always trade with a stop loss to protect your account balance. 
After you bought  XLM              coin, the protective stop loss can be placed below the DBLHC low. 
Step #5: Take Profit when we break below the up-sloping  trend line  that connects the swing low points 
The first thing we need to do when trading  Stellar -3.32%  and you want to cash out some of your profits is to draw an up-sloping  trend line  starting from the swing low you identified in Step #1 and connect all the swing low points that are part of this new uptrend. 
As soon as  Stellar -3.32% XLM              price breaks and closes below the upward  trend line  you take profits. 
This take profit strategy will maximize your trading profits and it will keep you as long as the  bullish  momentum is strong. 
Note** the above was an example of a BUY trade using the  Stellar -3.32%  cryptocurrency trading strategy. Use the same rules for a SELL trade – but in reverse.

StellarLumens has been in a  falling wedge  for months now. Falling  wedges  are a great buy opportunity  
because most of the time they will breakout when the price touches the  trend line  for the 5th time (ABCDE sequence). 
There has been a lot of hype around StellarLumens on social media which is also a great sign. 

Next to this the  MACD  had an  bullish  crossover which is a good sign.

And what I suspect in my last analyses (XRPUSD) is already happening in this coin, STRUSD.  

After falling outside the  Bollinger Bands  and touching the more critical 61.8%  Fibonacci retracement  level market is trying to stabilize. If market can maintain at least a close near the open (0.3100) then a return to the  Bollinger  midline becomes likely (0.3950 currently). 

Such action does not imply a turn in sentiment but rather coling off of short-term oversold conditions. 

Note that market has, in a wider view, retraced 38.2% of the entire downmove since the high posted at around 0.9500 at the start of 2018. Bulls task is again, as in other coins, to set a clear higher low to improve the overal picture.

					Stop Loss moved to $0.30 to take some profits. Position opened at $0.26. Will re-buy on the dip or if BTC crosses 7800 and stable. There might be a double bottom at $0.25 to start the next rally.

STELLAR/DOLLAR 4H 
DOUBLE BAR LOW HIGHER CLOSE PATTERN (DBLHC) 
What is  Stellar              Lumens? 
Stellar              is a platform that it’s trying to do very fast payments with very low fees. The key advantage of  Stellar              is that it has between 3 and 5 seconds confirmation time and it supports thousands of transactions per second. 
Stellar              Lumens price is below the $1 and trading at only a few cents, which makes  XLM -0.17%  a top cryptocurrency under $1. 
Stellar              Cryptocurrency Strategy 
All we need for swing trading cryptocurrency is the Double Bar Low Higher Close pattern also known as the DBLHC pattern. 
All you need is to look for two bars that have equal lows or near the same price level. The second condition that needs to be satisfied for a valid DBLHC is that the second candle needs to close a lot higher than the first candle (see chart above). 
Usually, the bar tails are tiny, but the  candlestick  body is large. 
Step #1: Find a  bullish trend  or wait until the market develops a swing low 
The double bar low higher close can be found at the end of a  bearish trend  and the start of a new  bullish trend  acting as a reversal  bullish pattern . However, at the same time, the DBLHC is also a continuation pattern that can develop at any stage during a  bullish trend . 
Having a prior trend already established increases the probabilities of the DBLHC pattern to work. 
The DBLHC can produce the same kind of results even when the market is only in the process of establishing a market swing low. If a DBLHC develops right after a swing low is created that’s the confirmation we need that the institutional money is buying low. 
Step #2: Wait until the DBLHC chart pattern develops on the  Stellar             XLM -0.17%  Chart 
Now that you’re familiarized with the DBLHC pattern, it should come easily to spot this powerful chart pattern on the  Stellar              chart. 
The DBLHC pattern has two identical lows and the second candle close is way higher than the high of the first candle. 
In most of the cases the first candle will be  bearish  followed by a second  bullish  candle, but as we can see the  Stellar              price action is developing a DBLHC were the first candle is also  bullish . This doesn’t invalidate the DBLHC chart pattern as in our books; it’s still a very tradeable chart pattern. 
Step #3: Buy at the market at the opening of the next candle after the DBLHC pattern 
When to buy  Stellar              is quite easy. As per the DBLHC pattern rules, we need to enter immediately at the market when the DBLHC has formed. Alternatively, we can place a buy limit order above the high of the second candle. 
Buying  Stellar              with our cryptocurrency buy strategy will offer you a high risk to reward ratio. 
The second advantage you have is that you’re buying  Stellar              right when the  bullish  momentum is starting to build up. Technically, this means that the price should never look back, which means that the drawdown should be minimal. 
Step #4: Place protective Stop Loss below the DBLHC low 
The DBLHC chart pattern also provides us with a great spot to hide your protective stop loss. 
Trading without a stop loss is the number one mistake that traders make. Make sure you always trade with a stop loss to protect your account balance. 
After you bought  XLM -0.17%  coin, the protective stop loss can be placed below the DBLHC low. 
Step #5: Take Profit when we break below the up-sloping  trend line  that connects the swing low points 
The first thing we need to do when trading  Stellar              and you want to cash out some of your profits is to draw an up-sloping  trend line  starting from the swing low you identified in Step #1 and connect all the swing low points that are part of this new uptrend. 
As soon as  Stellar             XLM -0.17%  price breaks and closes below the upward  trend line  you take profits. 
This take profit strategy will maximize your trading profits and it will keep you as long as the  bullish  momentum is strong. 
Note** the above was an example of a BUY trade using the  Stellar              cryptocurrency trading strategy. Use the same rules for a SELL trade – but in reverse.

StellarLumens has been in a  falling wedge  for months now. Falling  wedges  are a great buy opportunity  
because most of the time they will breakout when the price touches the  trend line  for the 5th time (ABCDE sequence). 
There has been a lot of hype around StellarLumens on social media which is also a great sign. 

Next to this the  MACD  had an  bullish  crossover which is a good sign.

And what I suspect in my last analyses (XRPUSD) is already happening in this coin, STRUSD.  

After falling outside the  Bollinger Bands  and touching the more critical 61.8%  Fibonacci retracement  level market is trying to stabilize. If market can maintain at least a close near the open (0.3100) then a return to the  Bollinger  midline becomes likely (0.3950 currently). 

Such action does not imply a turn in sentiment but rather coling off of short-term oversold conditions. 

Note that market has, in a wider view, retraced 38.2% of the entire downmove since the high posted at around 0.9500 at the start of 2018. Bulls task is again, as in other coins, to set a clear higher low to improve the overal picture.

 Stellar -3.32%  continues to move within the  descending channel  producing lower lows and lower highs. Trend remains  bearish  while price formed the low at $0.15.  

The most recent bounce of the upper  trendline  of the  descending channel  was on 28th of May and since then price has formed the resistance at 0.23. In order for STR/USD to start moving higher $0.23 resistance must be broken with a daily close above that price. 

It that happens,  Stellar -3.32%  is likely to start correcting upwards and potentially double in value, as the next strong resistance is seen at 88.6%  Fibonacci retracement , that is $0.44. 

On the other hand if resistance will be rejected, yet another wave down could be expected towards previously established low at $0.15 or a psychological support at $0.1

I love this coin and I hope It takes over XRP real soon. It looks like we are about finished with Wave 4 correction and currently in subwave 2 of greater wave 5 which has the potential to go above $1.00 or may be more. We are currently forming the handle of a Large cup formation. The handle can also be seen as the right shoulder of a large Inverted  H&S . The downside potential is 0.15c which will probably be in play if  BTC -1.83%  spoils the party (high probability).

StellarLumens has been in a  falling wedge  for months now. Falling  wedges  are a great buy opportunity  
because most of the time they will breakout when the price touches the  trend line  for the 5th time (ABCDE sequence). 
There has been a lot of hype around StellarLumens on social media which is also a great sign. 

Next to this the  MACD  had an  bullish  crossover which is a good sign. 


I presonally am accumulating starting now.
