I tried to make a good reflection of the whole cryptomarket. I only could do this with coins that been trading for more than a year. Otherwise the chart did not work. So I made a chart with the following coins: 
BTC             , ETH, XRP, LTC, DASH, NEO, MONERO,  XEM             

If people also wanna chart on this chart use the following ticker: 
COINBASE:BTCUSD*16692550+BITFINEX:ETHUSD*92862174+BITTREX:XRPUSD*38622892459+BITFINEX:LTCUSD*53927233+BITTREX:DASHUSD*7701656+BITTREX:NEOUSD*65000000+BITTREX:XMRUSD*15377976+BITTREX:XEMUSD*8999999999 

About the charts 
The first chart you see is on the logic alghoritme. The second one in normal view. 

On the first alghoritme we see a big rising wedge! On the second one you see the beautifull elliot-wave pattern. The 5th wave or 3th wave up reached the 1.618 fibonacci level, the same level als the last crash.  

I think there could be an abc-correction wave. With a total retracement of the whole cryptocurrancy market of 35-55%. 

Some other information to think about. Correct me when i'm wrong! 
First crash:  
-20 june the total marketcap of cryptocurrancies was 115 million.  
-16 july the total marketcap of cryptocurrancies 67 million  

Trigger: The first  bitcoin              fork?  

Second crash:  
-1 september the total marketcap of cryptocurrancies was 174 million.  
-15 september the total marketcap of cryptocurrancies was 109 million.  

Trigger: China Ban?  

The last and upcomming crash>  
It should be time for a correction of the total market! I think there is a huge change.  

Trigger: I really think the Tether usd hack could trigger a crash.  

Last thing I want to say, I try to do an objective view. I believe it will happen. You don't have to agree with me, take your own conclusion!

The bitcoin dominance is 56%. So the total marketcap of the other coins should be 44%. 

Total marketcap: 54.000.000.000 / 44% = 122.727.000.000 usd 
Bitcoin: 122.727.000.000 - 54.000.000.000 = 68.727.000.000 usd 

So the bitcoin should multiplied by 68.727.000.000 / 138.000.000.000 = 50%

Hello guys, 

XMR has reached it's bottom and if 150USD stays unbroken, we can clearly assume it. It may move to the upper downtrend line in few days. 

Target date is around June 15th. As you can see, there is always 50 days between each high. 

Let's see if this pattern plays out again ! If so, there is a nice 20% to make ! :) 

BUY : 150 - 160 
SELL : 200 - 220 
STOP : 145 

Feel free to comment and follow.  

Cheers,

Monero is a great privacy coin with around 2X - 10X possibility this year  

We are leaning more towards 8X - 10X however due to numerous privacy coins entering larger market, we might see slower price growth  

In all this is a great investment for long term

On this occasion we are looking for an entry in the XMR and USD parity to open a long position that takes us to a price of around 152 USD.  

We have to be aware of the confirmation of buying signal that is currently developing.  

Buy strategy: 
1) The price (candle) closed above the Kijun (pink line) is a well-known strategy using  Ichimoku . 
2) But, we prefer a confirmation, then we wait for Tenkan (blue line) crossing Kijun (pink line). 

MACD+DI also can provide us further confirmation of the signal (green points). 
The  RSI  is currently above 50. It is an indication of a  bullish  market.  

Our target is 152 USD. And our Stop Loss, 113 USD. The SL is determined by the support offered by the lower line of the Kumo (cloud).  

Stay tuned of any changes and good luck!

					XMR could not stand the rise of BTC. As a result, XMR lost its bullish trend in time frames shorter than 1 hour. 

You can use the RSI as a trend reversal indicator and should expect a rebound from the 45 - 50 levels. The RSI should be kept in the upward half of the chart to validate a bearish reversal. If the latter does not occur, consider selling according to your risk level.

One version of the story has the emperor going bankrupt as the 63 doublings ultimately totaled 18 million trillion grains of rice. At ten grains of rice per square inch, this requires rice fields covering twice the surface area of the Earth, oceans included. Another version of the story has the inventor losing his head.

					Quoted for possible truth:  

""It's not about HW wallets or anything, XMR is being price suppressed because big players are accumulating it big time. As someone said smart money is well aware of monero and they want to keep it as much as they can for themselves until inflation is low and they can mark the price way up 

Didn't you guys notice we always are the last to pump ? its because pump happen in hierarchical orders, first you get the shittest of the the shitcoins with the wierd names like GROESTLECOIN and so on, then you got noob coins and strange coins and semi good coins, and when smart money has taken dumb money for as much as they can they pump XMR because they need to store their accumulated wealth somewhere, and whats the better place than monero? 

Next year, we'll be at 4% inflation, this is bitcoin level now, and then quickly we'll be under bitcoin yearly inflation... this will be the time to mark up the price BIG TIME, I'm talking BTC current level 

This is a slow play, this is like poker when you got quad aces and you want to take as much as you can from the noobs, you take your time, you let dumb money bids and buy DRAGONCHAIN and then you put your profit back into XMR.  

RINSE and REPEAT until we're at 2-3% inflation and price is above 10K and doesn't come back. ""

This is my idea for Monero. In my eyes XMR is the leader when it comes to private crypto transactions. However, 
I am not sure how big of an impact regulations will have on privacy coins. This idea is just based on previous chart patterns without considering fundamentals.

I think there could be an abc-correction wave. With a total retracement of the whole cryptocurrancy market of 35-55%. 

Some other information to think about. Correct me when i'm wrong! 
First crash:  
-20 june the total marketcap of cryptocurrancies was 115 million.  
-16 july the total marketcap of cryptocurrancies 67 million  

Trigger: The first  bitcoin              fork?  

Second crash:  
-1 september the total marketcap of cryptocurrancies was 174 million.  
-15 september the total marketcap of cryptocurrancies was 109 million.  

Trigger: China Ban?  

The last and upcomming crash>  
It should be time for a correction of the total market! I think there is a huge change.  

Trigger: I really think the Tether usd hack could trigger a crash.  

Last thing I want to say, I try to do an objective view. I believe it will happen. You don't have to agree with me, take your own conclusion!

The bitcoin dominance is 56%. So the total marketcap of the other coins should be 44%. 

Total marketcap: 54.000.000.000 / 44% = 122.727.000.000 usd 
Bitcoin: 122.727.000.000 - 54.000.000.000 = 68.727.000.000 usd 

So the bitcoin should multiplied by 68.727.000.000 / 138.000.000.000 = 50%

Hello guys, 

XMR has reached it's bottom and if 150USD stays unbroken, we can clearly assume it. It may move to the upper downtrend line in few days. 

Target date is around June 15th. As you can see, there is always 50 days between each high. 

Let's see if this pattern plays out again ! If so, there is a nice 20% to make ! :) 

BUY : 150 - 160 
SELL : 200 - 220 
STOP : 145 

Feel free to comment and follow.  

Cheers,

We are leaning more towards 8X - 10X however due to numerous privacy coins entering larger market, we might see slower price growth  

In all this is a great investment for long term

On this occasion we are looking for an entry in the XMR and USD parity to open a long position that takes us to a price of around 152 USD.  

We have to be aware of the confirmation of buying signal that is currently developing.  

Buy strategy: 
1) The price (candle) closed above the Kijun (pink line) is a well-known strategy using  Ichimoku . 
2) But, we prefer a confirmation, then we wait for Tenkan (blue line) crossing Kijun (pink line). 

MACD+DI also can provide us further confirmation of the signal (green points). 
The  RSI  is currently above 50. It is an indication of a  bullish  market.  

Our target is 152 USD. And our Stop Loss, 113 USD. The SL is determined by the support offered by the lower line of the Kumo (cloud).  

Stay tuned of any changes and good luck!

You can use the RSI as a trend reversal indicator and should expect a rebound from the 45 - 50 levels. The RSI should be kept in the upward half of the chart to validate a bearish reversal. If the latter does not occur, consider selling according to your risk level.

In response to the emperor’s offer of a reward for his new beloved game, the inventor asked for a single grain of rice on the first square, two on the second square, four on the third, and so on. The Emperor quickly granted this seemingly benign and humble request. 

One version of the story has the emperor going bankrupt as the 63 doublings ultimately totaled 18 million trillion grains of rice. At ten grains of rice per square inch, this requires rice fields covering twice the surface area of the Earth, oceans included. Another version of the story has the inventor losing his head.

					Quoted for possible truth:  

""It's not about HW wallets or anything, XMR is being price suppressed because big players are accumulating it big time. As someone said smart money is well aware of monero and they want to keep it as much as they can for themselves until inflation is low and they can mark the price way up 

Didn't you guys notice we always are the last to pump ? its because pump happen in hierarchical orders, first you get the shittest of the the shitcoins with the wierd names like GROESTLECOIN and so on, then you got noob coins and strange coins and semi good coins, and when smart money has taken dumb money for as much as they can they pump XMR because they need to store their accumulated wealth somewhere, and whats the better place than monero? 

Next year, we'll be at 4% inflation, this is bitcoin level now, and then quickly we'll be under bitcoin yearly inflation... this will be the time to mark up the price BIG TIME, I'm talking BTC current level 

This is a slow play, this is like poker when you got quad aces and you want to take as much as you can from the noobs, you take your time, you let dumb money bids and buy DRAGONCHAIN and then you put your profit back into XMR.  

RINSE and REPEAT until we're at 2-3% inflation and price is above 10K and doesn't come back. ""

This is my idea for Monero. In my eyes XMR is the leader when it comes to private crypto transactions. However, 
I am not sure how big of an impact regulations will have on privacy coins. This idea is just based on previous chart patterns without considering fundamentals.

Nov 21, 2017




I tried to make a good reflection of the whole cryptomarket. I only could do this with coins that been trading for more than a year. Otherwise the chart did not work. So I made a chart with the following coins: 
BTC -1.87% , ETH, XRP, LTC, DASH, NEO, MONERO,  XEM -1.35% 

If people also wanna chart on this chart use the following ticker: 
COINBASE:BTCUSD*16692550+BITFINEX:ETHUSD*92862174+BITTREX:XRPUSD*38622892459+BITFINEX:LTCUSD*53927233+BITTREX:DASHUSD*7701656+BITTREX:NEOUSD*65000000+BITTREX:XMRUSD*15377976+BITTREX:XEMUSD*8999999999 

About the charts 
The first chart you see is on the logic alghoritme. The second one in normal view. 

On the first alghoritme we see a big rising wedge! On the second one you see the beautifull elliot-wave pattern. The 5th wave or 3th wave up reached the 1.618 fibonacci level, the same level als the last crash.  

I think there could be an abc-correction wave. With a total retracement of the whole cryptocurrancy market of 35-55%. 

Some other information to think about. Correct me when i'm wrong! 
First crash:  
-20 june the total marketcap of cryptocurrancies was 115 million.  
-16 july the total marketcap of cryptocurrancies 67 million  

Trigger: The first  bitcoin -1.87%  fork?  

Second crash:  
-1 september the total marketcap of cryptocurrancies was 174 million.  
-15 september the total marketcap of cryptocurrancies was 109 million.  

Trigger: China Ban?  

The last and upcomming crash>  
It should be time for a correction of the total market! I think there is a huge change.  

Trigger: I really think the Tether usd hack could trigger a crash.  

Last thing I want to say, I try to do an objective view. I believe it will happen. You don't have to agree with me, take your own conclusion!

Total marketcap: 54.000.000.000 / 44% = 122.727.000.000 usd 
Bitcoin: 122.727.000.000 - 54.000.000.000 = 68.727.000.000 usd 

So the bitcoin should multiplied by 68.727.000.000 / 138.000.000.000 = 50%

Hello guys, 

XMR has reached it's bottom and if 150USD stays unbroken, we can clearly assume it. It may move to the upper downtrend line in few days. 

Target date is around June 15th. As you can see, there is always 50 days between each high. 

Let's see if this pattern plays out again ! If so, there is a nice 20% to make ! :) 

BUY : 150 - 160 
SELL : 200 - 220 
STOP : 145 

Feel free to comment and follow.  

Cheers,

Monero is a great privacy coin with around 2X - 10X possibility this year  

We are leaning more towards 8X - 10X however due to numerous privacy coins entering larger market, we might see slower price growth  

In all this is a great investment for long term

On this occasion we are looking for an entry in the XMR and USD parity to open a long position that takes us to a price of around 152 USD.  

We have to be aware of the confirmation of buying signal that is currently developing.  

Buy strategy: 
1) The price (candle) closed above the Kijun (pink line) is a well-known strategy using  Ichimoku . 
2) But, we prefer a confirmation, then we wait for Tenkan (blue line) crossing Kijun (pink line). 

MACD+DI also can provide us further confirmation of the signal (green points). 
The  RSI  is currently above 50. It is an indication of a  bullish  market.  

Our target is 152 USD. And our Stop Loss, 113 USD. The SL is determined by the support offered by the lower line of the Kumo (cloud).  

Stay tuned of any changes and good luck!

You can use the RSI as a trend reversal indicator and should expect a rebound from the 45 - 50 levels. The RSI should be kept in the upward half of the chart to validate a bearish reversal. If the latter does not occur, consider selling according to your risk level.

One version of the story has the emperor going bankrupt as the 63 doublings ultimately totaled 18 million trillion grains of rice. At ten grains of rice per square inch, this requires rice fields covering twice the surface area of the Earth, oceans included. Another version of the story has the inventor losing his head.

					Quoted for possible truth:  

""It's not about HW wallets or anything, XMR is being price suppressed because big players are accumulating it big time. As someone said smart money is well aware of monero and they want to keep it as much as they can for themselves until inflation is low and they can mark the price way up 

Didn't you guys notice we always are the last to pump ? its because pump happen in hierarchical orders, first you get the shittest of the the shitcoins with the wierd names like GROESTLECOIN and so on, then you got noob coins and strange coins and semi good coins, and when smart money has taken dumb money for as much as they can they pump XMR because they need to store their accumulated wealth somewhere, and whats the better place than monero? 

Next year, we'll be at 4% inflation, this is bitcoin level now, and then quickly we'll be under bitcoin yearly inflation... this will be the time to mark up the price BIG TIME, I'm talking BTC current level 

This is a slow play, this is like poker when you got quad aces and you want to take as much as you can from the noobs, you take your time, you let dumb money bids and buy DRAGONCHAIN and then you put your profit back into XMR.  

RINSE and REPEAT until we're at 2-3% inflation and price is above 10K and doesn't come back. ""

This is my idea for Monero. In my eyes XMR is the leader when it comes to private crypto transactions. However, 
I am not sure how big of an impact regulations will have on privacy coins. This idea is just based on previous chart patterns without considering fundamentals.

I tried to make a good reflection of the whole cryptomarket. I only could do this with coins that been trading for more than a year. Otherwise the chart did not work. So I made a chart with the following coins: 
BTC             , ETH, XRP, LTC, DASH, NEO, MONERO,  XEM             

If people also wanna chart on this chart use the following ticker: 
COINBASE:BTCUSD*16692550+BITFINEX:ETHUSD*92862174+BITTREX:XRPUSD*38622892459+BITFINEX:LTCUSD*53927233+BITTREX:DASHUSD*7701656+BITTREX:NEOUSD*65000000+BITTREX:XMRUSD*15377976+BITTREX:XEMUSD*8999999999 

About the charts 
The first chart you see is on the logic alghoritme. The second one in normal view. 

On the first alghoritme we see a big rising wedge! On the second one you see the beautifull elliot-wave pattern. The 5th wave or 3th wave up reached the 1.618 fibonacci level, the same level als the last crash.  

I think there could be an abc-correction wave. With a total retracement of the whole cryptocurrancy market of 35-55%. 

Some other information to think about. Correct me when i'm wrong! 
First crash:  
-20 june the total marketcap of cryptocurrancies was 115 million.  
-16 july the total marketcap of cryptocurrancies 67 million  

Trigger: The first  bitcoin              fork?  

Second crash:  
-1 september the total marketcap of cryptocurrancies was 174 million.  
-15 september the total marketcap of cryptocurrancies was 109 million.  

Trigger: China Ban?  

The last and upcomming crash>  
It should be time for a correction of the total market! I think there is a huge change.  

Trigger: I really think the Tether usd hack could trigger a crash.  

Last thing I want to say, I try to do an objective view. I believe it will happen. You don't have to agree with me, take your own conclusion!

Total marketcap: 54.000.000.000 / 44% = 122.727.000.000 usd 
Bitcoin: 122.727.000.000 - 54.000.000.000 = 68.727.000.000 usd

Hello guys, 

XMR has reached it's bottom and if 150USD stays unbroken, we can clearly assume it. It may move to the upper downtrend line in few days. 

Target date is around June 15th. As you can see, there is always 50 days between each high. 

Let's see if this pattern plays out again ! If so, there is a nice 20% to make ! :)

On this occasion we are looking for an entry in the XMR and USD parity to open a long position that takes us to a price of around 152 USD.  

We have to be aware of the confirmation of buying signal that is currently developing.  

Buy strategy: 
1) The price (candle) closed above the Kijun (pink line) is a well-known strategy using  Ichimoku . 
2) But, we prefer a confirmation, then we wait for Tenkan (blue line) crossing Kijun (pink line). 

MACD+DI also can provide us further confirmation of the signal (green points). 
The  RSI  is currently above 50. It is an indication of a  bullish  market.  

Our target is 152 USD. And our Stop Loss, 113 USD. The SL is determined by the support offered by the lower line of the Kumo (cloud).  

Stay tuned of any changes and good luck!

You can use the RSI as a trend reversal indicator and should expect a rebound from the 45 - 50 levels. The RSI should be kept in the upward half of the chart to validate a bearish reversal. If the latter does not occur, consider selling according to your risk level.

In response to the emperor’s offer of a reward for his new beloved game, the inventor asked for a single grain of rice on the first square, two on the second square, four on the third, and so on. The Emperor quickly granted this seemingly benign and humble request. 

One version of the story has the emperor going bankrupt as the 63 doublings ultimately totaled 18 million trillion grains of rice. At ten grains of rice per square inch, this requires rice fields covering twice the surface area of the Earth, oceans included. Another version of the story has the inventor losing his head.

Comment:
					Quoted for possible truth:  

""It's not about HW wallets or anything, XMR is being price suppressed because big players are accumulating it big time. As someone said smart money is well aware of monero and they want to keep it as much as they can for themselves until inflation is low and they can mark the price way up 

Didn't you guys notice we always are the last to pump ? its because pump happen in hierarchical orders, first you get the shittest of the the shitcoins with the wierd names like GROESTLECOIN and so on, then you got noob coins and strange coins and semi good coins, and when smart money has taken dumb money for as much as they can they pump XMR because they need to store their accumulated wealth somewhere, and whats the better place than monero? 

Next year, we'll be at 4% inflation, this is bitcoin level now, and then quickly we'll be under bitcoin yearly inflation... this will be the time to mark up the price BIG TIME, I'm talking BTC current level 

This is a slow play, this is like poker when you got quad aces and you want to take as much as you can from the noobs, you take your time, you let dumb money bids and buy DRAGONCHAIN and then you put your profit back into XMR.  

RINSE and REPEAT until we're at 2-3% inflation and price is above 10K and doesn't come back. ""

This is my idea for Monero. In my eyes XMR is the leader when it comes to private crypto transactions. However, 
I am not sure how big of an impact regulations will have on privacy coins. This idea is just based on previous chart patterns without considering fundamentals.

Nov 21, 2017




I tried to make a good reflection of the whole cryptomarket. I only could do this with coins that been trading for more than a year. Otherwise the chart did not work. So I made a chart with the following coins: 
BTC             , ETH, XRP, LTC, DASH, NEO, MONERO,  XEM             

If people also wanna chart on this chart use the following ticker: 
COINBASE:BTCUSD*16692550+BITFINEX:ETHUSD*92862174+BITTREX:XRPUSD*38622892459+BITFINEX:LTCUSD*53927233+BITTREX:DASHUSD*7701656+BITTREX:NEOUSD*65000000+BITTREX:XMRUSD*15377976+BITTREX:XEMUSD*8999999999 

About the charts 
The first chart you see is on the logic alghoritme. The second one in normal view. 

On the first alghoritme we see a big rising wedge! On the second one you see the beautifull elliot-wave pattern. The 5th wave or 3th wave up reached the 1.618 fibonacci level, the same level als the last crash.  

I think there could be an abc-correction wave. With a total retracement of the whole cryptocurrancy market of 35-55%. 

Some other information to think about. Correct me when i'm wrong! 
First crash:  
-20 june the total marketcap of cryptocurrancies was 115 million.  
-16 july the total marketcap of cryptocurrancies 67 million  

Trigger: The first  bitcoin              fork?  

Second crash:  
-1 september the total marketcap of cryptocurrancies was 174 million.  
-15 september the total marketcap of cryptocurrancies was 109 million.  

Trigger: China Ban?  

The last and upcomming crash>  
It should be time for a correction of the total market! I think there is a huge change.  

Trigger: I really think the Tether usd hack could trigger a crash.  

Last thing I want to say, I try to do an objective view. I believe it will happen. You don't have to agree with me, take your own conclusion!

The bitcoin dominance is 56%. So the total marketcap of the other coins should be 44%. 

Total marketcap: 54.000.000.000 / 44% = 122.727.000.000 usd 
Bitcoin: 122.727.000.000 - 54.000.000.000 = 68.727.000.000 usd 

So the bitcoin should multiplied by 68.727.000.000 / 138.000.000.000 = 50%

Hello guys, 

XMR has reached it's bottom and if 150USD stays unbroken, we can clearly assume it. It may move to the upper downtrend line in few days. 

Target date is around June 15th. As you can see, there is always 50 days between each high. 

Let's see if this pattern plays out again ! If so, there is a nice 20% to make ! :) 

BUY : 150 - 160 
SELL : 200 - 220 
STOP : 145 

Feel free to comment and follow.

Comment:
					""I am fond of telling the tale of the inventor of chess and his patron, the Emperor of China. 

In response to the emperor’s offer of a reward for his new beloved game, the inventor asked for a single grain of rice on the first square, two on the second square, four on the third, and so on. The Emperor quickly granted this seemingly benign and humble request. 

One version of the story has the emperor going bankrupt as the 63 doublings ultimately totaled 18 million trillion grains of rice. At ten grains of rice per square inch, this requires rice fields covering twice the surface area of the Earth, oceans included. Another version of the story has the inventor losing his head.

""The inventor was given spoonfuls of rice, then bowls of rice, then barrels. By the end of the first half of the chess board, the inventor had accumulated one large field’s worth (4 billion grains), and the emperor did start to take notice.""

Comment:
					Quoted for possible truth:  

""It's not about HW wallets or anything, XMR is being price suppressed because big players are accumulating it big time. As someone said smart money is well aware of monero and they want to keep it as much as they can for themselves until inflation is low and they can mark the price way up 

Didn't you guys notice we always are the last to pump ? its because pump happen in hierarchical orders, first you get the shittest of the the shitcoins with the wierd names like GROESTLECOIN and so on, then you got noob coins and strange coins and semi good coins, and when smart money has taken dumb money for as much as they can they pump XMR because they need to store their accumulated wealth somewhere, and whats the better place than monero? 

Next year, we'll be at 4% inflation, this is bitcoin level now, and then quickly we'll be under bitcoin yearly inflation... this will be the time to mark up the price BIG TIME, I'm talking BTC current level 

This is a slow play, this is like poker when you got quad aces and you want to take as much as you can from the noobs, you take your time, you let dumb money bids and buy DRAGONCHAIN and then you put your profit back into XMR.  

RINSE and REPEAT until we're at 2-3% inflation and price is above 10K and doesn't come back. ""

This is my idea for Monero. In my eyes XMR is the leader when it comes to private crypto transactions. However, 
I am not sure how big of an impact regulations will have on privacy coins. This idea is just based on previous chart patterns without considering fundamentals.

Nov 21, 2017




I tried to make a good reflection of the whole cryptomarket. I only could do this with coins that been trading for more than a year. Otherwise the chart did not work. So I made a chart with the following coins: 
BTC -1.69% , ETH, XRP, LTC, DASH, NEO, MONERO,  XEM -1.35% 

If people also wanna chart on this chart use the following ticker: 
COINBASE:BTCUSD*16692550+BITFINEX:ETHUSD*92862174+BITTREX:XRPUSD*38622892459+BITFINEX:LTCUSD*53927233+BITTREX:DASHUSD*7701656+BITTREX:NEOUSD*65000000+BITTREX:XMRUSD*15377976+BITTREX:XEMUSD*8999999999 

About the charts 
The first chart you see is on the logic alghoritme. The second one in normal view. 

On the first alghoritme we see a big rising wedge! On the second one you see the beautifull elliot-wave pattern. The 5th wave or 3th wave up reached the 1.618 fibonacci level, the same level als the last crash.  

I think there could be an abc-correction wave. With a total retracement of the whole cryptocurrancy market of 35-55%. 

Some other information to think about. Correct me when i'm wrong! 
First crash:  
-20 june the total marketcap of cryptocurrancies was 115 million.  
-16 july the total marketcap of cryptocurrancies 67 million  

Trigger: The first  bitcoin -1.69%  fork?  

Second crash:  
-1 september the total marketcap of cryptocurrancies was 174 million.  
-15 september the total marketcap of cryptocurrancies was 109 million.  

Trigger: China Ban?  

The last and upcomming crash>  
It should be time for a correction of the total market! I think there is a huge change.  

Trigger: I really think the Tether usd hack could trigger a crash.  

Last thing I want to say, I try to do an objective view. I believe it will happen. You don't have to agree with me, take your own conclusion!

Total except bitcoin: 54.000.000.000 usd 

The bitcoin dominance is 56%. So the total marketcap of the other coins should be 44%. 

Total marketcap: 54.000.000.000 / 44% = 122.727.000.000 usd 
Bitcoin: 122.727.000.000 - 54.000.000.000 = 68.727.000.000 usd 

So the bitcoin should multiplied by 68.727.000.000 / 138.000.000.000 = 50%

Hello guys, 

XMR has reached it's bottom and if 150USD stays unbroken, we can clearly assume it. It may move to the upper downtrend line in few days. 

Target date is around June 15th. As you can see, there is always 50 days between each high. 

Let's see if this pattern plays out again ! If so, there is a nice 20% to make ! :) 

BUY : 150 - 160 
SELL : 200 - 220 
STOP : 145 

Feel free to comment and follow.  

Cheers,

- EMA 10 (fast) above EMA 70 (slow) 
- EMA 70 (short term) crossing with EMA200 (long term) : potential reversal

Monero is a great privacy coin with around 2X - 10X possibility this year  

We are leaning more towards 8X - 10X however due to numerous privacy coins entering larger market, we might see slower price growth  

In all this is a great investment for long term

On this occasion we are looking for an entry in the XMR and USD parity to open a long position that takes us to a price of around 152 USD.  

We have to be aware of the confirmation of buying signal that is currently developing.  

Buy strategy: 
1) The price (candle) closed above the Kijun (pink line) is a well-known strategy using  Ichimoku . 
2) But, we prefer a confirmation, then we wait for Tenkan (blue line) crossing Kijun (pink line). 

MACD+DI also can provide us further confirmation of the signal (green points). 
The  RSI  is currently above 50. It is an indication of a  bullish  market.  

Our target is 152 USD. And our Stop Loss, 113 USD. The SL is determined by the support offered by the lower line of the Kumo (cloud).  

Stay tuned of any changes and good luck!

					XMR could not stand the rise of BTC. As a result, XMR lost its bullish trend in time frames shorter than 1 hour. 

You can use the RSI as a trend reversal indicator and should expect a rebound from the 45 - 50 levels. The RSI should be kept in the upward half of the chart to validate a bearish reversal. If the latter does not occur, consider selling according to your risk level.

""It's not about HW wallets or anything, XMR is being price suppressed because big players are accumulating it big time. As someone said smart money is well aware of monero and they want to keep it as much as they can for themselves until inflation is low and they can mark the price way up 

Didn't you guys notice we always are the last to pump ? its because pump happen in hierarchical orders, first you get the shittest of the the shitcoins with the wierd names like GROESTLECOIN and so on, then you got noob coins and strange coins and semi good coins, and when smart money has taken dumb money for as much as they can they pump XMR because they need to store their accumulated wealth somewhere, and whats the better place than monero? 

Next year, we'll be at 4% inflation, this is bitcoin level now, and then quickly we'll be under bitcoin yearly inflation... this will be the time to mark up the price BIG TIME, I'm talking BTC current level 

This is a slow play, this is like poker when you got quad aces and you want to take as much as you can from the noobs, you take your time, you let dumb money bids and buy DRAGONCHAIN and then you put your profit back into XMR.  

RINSE and REPEAT until we're at 2-3% inflation and price is above 10K and doesn't come back. ""

This is my idea for Monero. In my eyes XMR is the leader when it comes to private crypto transactions. However, 
I am not sure how big of an impact regulations will have on privacy coins. This idea is just based on previous chart patterns without considering fundamentals.

Nov 21, 2017




I tried to make a good reflection of the whole cryptomarket. I only could do this with coins that been trading for more than a year. Otherwise the chart did not work. So I made a chart with the following coins: 
BTC -1.67% , ETH, XRP, LTC, DASH, NEO, MONERO,  XEM -1.35% 

If people also wanna chart on this chart use the following ticker: 
COINBASE:BTCUSD*16692550+BITFINEX:ETHUSD*92862174+BITTREX:XRPUSD*38622892459+BITFINEX:LTCUSD*53927233+BITTREX:DASHUSD*7701656+BITTREX:NEOUSD*65000000+BITTREX:XMRUSD*15377976+BITTREX:XEMUSD*8999999999 

About the charts 
The first chart you see is on the logic alghoritme. The second one in normal view. 

On the first alghoritme we see a big rising wedge! On the second one you see the beautifull elliot-wave pattern. The 5th wave or 3th wave up reached the 1.618 fibonacci level, the same level als the last crash.  

I think there could be an abc-correction wave. With a total retracement of the whole cryptocurrancy market of 35-55%. 

Some other information to think about. Correct me when i'm wrong! 
First crash:  
-20 june the total marketcap of cryptocurrancies was 115 million.  
-16 july the total marketcap of cryptocurrancies 67 million  

Trigger: The first  bitcoin -1.67%  fork?  

Second crash:  
-1 september the total marketcap of cryptocurrancies was 174 million.  
-15 september the total marketcap of cryptocurrancies was 109 million.  

Trigger: China Ban?  

The last and upcomming crash>  
It should be time for a correction of the total market! I think there is a huge change.  

Trigger: I really think the Tether usd hack could trigger a crash.  

Last thing I want to say, I try to do an objective view. I believe it will happen. You don't have to agree with me, take your own conclusion!

The bitcoin dominance is 56%. So the total marketcap of the other coins should be 44%. 

Total marketcap: 54.000.000.000 / 44% = 122.727.000.000 usd 
Bitcoin: 122.727.000.000 - 54.000.000.000 = 68.727.000.000 usd 

So the bitcoin should multiplied by 68.727.000.000 / 138.000.000.000 = 50%

Hello guys, 

XMR has reached it's bottom and if 150USD stays unbroken, we can clearly assume it. It may move to the upper downtrend line in few days. 

Target date is around June 15th. As you can see, there is always 50 days between each high. 

Let's see if this pattern plays out again ! If so, there is a nice 20% to make ! :) 

BUY : 150 - 160 
SELL : 200 - 220 
STOP : 145 

Feel free to comment and follow.  

Cheers,

Monero is a great privacy coin with around 2X - 10X possibility this year

In all this is a great investment for long term

On this occasion we are looking for an entry in the XMR and USD parity to open a long position that takes us to a price of around 152 USD.  

We have to be aware of the confirmation of buying signal that is currently developing.  

Buy strategy: 
1) The price (candle) closed above the Kijun (pink line) is a well-known strategy using  Ichimoku . 
2) But, we prefer a confirmation, then we wait for Tenkan (blue line) crossing Kijun (pink line). 

MACD+DI also can provide us further confirmation of the signal (green points). 
The  RSI  is currently above 50. It is an indication of a  bullish  market.  

Our target is 152 USD. And our Stop Loss, 113 USD. The SL is determined by the support offered by the lower line of the Kumo (cloud).  

Stay tuned of any changes and good luck!

You can use the RSI as a trend reversal indicator and should expect a rebound from the 45 - 50 levels. The RSI should be kept in the upward half of the chart to validate a bearish reversal. If the latter does not occur, consider selling according to your risk level.

I tried to make a good reflection of the whole cryptomarket. I only could do this with coins that been trading for more than a year. Otherwise the chart did not work. So I made a chart with the following coins: 
BTC -1.65% , ETH, XRP, LTC, DASH, NEO, MONERO,  XEM             

If people also wanna chart on this chart use the following ticker: 
COINBASE:BTCUSD*16692550+BITFINEX:ETHUSD*92862174+BITTREX:XRPUSD*38622892459+BITFINEX:LTCUSD*53927233+BITTREX:DASHUSD*7701656+BITTREX:NEOUSD*65000000+BITTREX:XMRUSD*15377976+BITTREX:XEMUSD*8999999999 

About the charts 
The first chart you see is on the logic alghoritme. The second one in normal view. 

On the first alghoritme we see a big rising wedge! On the second one you see the beautifull elliot-wave pattern. The 5th wave or 3th wave up reached the 1.618 fibonacci level, the same level als the last crash.  

I think there could be an abc-correction wave. With a total retracement of the whole cryptocurrancy market of 35-55%. 

Some other information to think about. Correct me when i'm wrong! 
First crash:  
-20 june the total marketcap of cryptocurrancies was 115 million.  
-16 july the total marketcap of cryptocurrancies 67 million  

Trigger: The first  bitcoin -1.65%  fork?  

Second crash:  
-1 september the total marketcap of cryptocurrancies was 174 million.  
-15 september the total marketcap of cryptocurrancies was 109 million.  

Trigger: China Ban?  

The last and upcomming crash>  
It should be time for a correction of the total market! I think there is a huge change.  

Trigger: I really think the Tether usd hack could trigger a crash.  

Last thing I want to say, I try to do an objective view. I believe it will happen. You don't have to agree with me, take your own conclusion!

The bitcoin dominance is 56%. So the total marketcap of the other coins should be 44%. 

Total marketcap: 54.000.000.000 / 44% = 122.727.000.000 usd 
Bitcoin: 122.727.000.000 - 54.000.000.000 = 68.727.000.000 usd 

So the bitcoin should multiplied by 68.727.000.000 / 138.000.000.000 = 50%

Hello guys, 

XMR has reached it's bottom and if 150USD stays unbroken, we can clearly assume it. It may move to the upper downtrend line in few days. 

Target date is around June 15th. As you can see, there is always 50 days between each high. 

Let's see if this pattern plays out again ! If so, there is a nice 20% to make ! :) 

BUY : 150 - 160 
SELL : 200 - 220 
STOP : 145 

Feel free to comment and follow.  

Cheers,

On this occasion we are looking for an entry in the XMR and USD parity to open a long position that takes us to a price of around 152 USD.  

We have to be aware of the confirmation of buying signal that is currently developing.  

Buy strategy: 
1) The price (candle) closed above the Kijun (pink line) is a well-known strategy using  Ichimoku . 
2) But, we prefer a confirmation, then we wait for Tenkan (blue line) crossing Kijun (pink line). 

MACD+DI also can provide us further confirmation of the signal (green points). 
The  RSI  is currently above 50. It is an indication of a  bullish  market.  

Our target is 152 USD. And our Stop Loss, 113 USD. The SL is determined by the support offered by the lower line of the Kumo (cloud).  

Stay tuned of any changes and good luck!

You can use the RSI as a trend reversal indicator and should expect a rebound from the 45 - 50 levels. The RSI should be kept in the upward half of the chart to validate a bearish reversal. If the latter does not occur, consider selling according to your risk level.

One version of the story has the emperor going bankrupt as the 63 doublings ultimately totaled 18 million trillion grains of rice. At ten grains of rice per square inch, this requires rice fields covering twice the surface area of the Earth, oceans included. Another version of the story has the inventor losing his head.

""It's not about HW wallets or anything, XMR is being price suppressed because big players are accumulating it big time. As someone said smart money is well aware of monero and they want to keep it as much as they can for themselves until inflation is low and they can mark the price way up 

Didn't you guys notice we always are the last to pump ? its because pump happen in hierarchical orders, first you get the shittest of the the shitcoins with the wierd names like GROESTLECOIN and so on, then you got noob coins and strange coins and semi good coins, and when smart money has taken dumb money for as much as they can they pump XMR because they need to store their accumulated wealth somewhere, and whats the better place than monero? 

Next year, we'll be at 4% inflation, this is bitcoin level now, and then quickly we'll be under bitcoin yearly inflation... this will be the time to mark up the price BIG TIME, I'm talking BTC current level 

This is a slow play, this is like poker when you got quad aces and you want to take as much as you can from the noobs, you take your time, you let dumb money bids and buy DRAGONCHAIN and then you put your profit back into XMR.  

RINSE and REPEAT until we're at 2-3% inflation and price is above 10K and doesn't come back. ""

This is my idea for Monero. In my eyes XMR is the leader when it comes to private crypto transactions. However, 
I am not sure how big of an impact regulations will have on privacy coins. This idea is just based on previous chart patterns without considering fundamentals.

Bitcoin: 122.727.000.000 - 54.000.000.000 = 68.727.000.000 usd 

So the bitcoin should multiplied by 68.727.000.000 / 138.000.000.000 = 50%

Hello guys, 

XMR has reached it's bottom and if 150USD stays unbroken, we can clearly assume it. It may move to the upper downtrend line in few days. 

Target date is around June 15th. As you can see, there is always 50 days between each high. 

Let's see if this pattern plays out again ! If so, there is a nice 20% to make ! :) 

BUY : 150 - 160 
SELL : 200 - 220 
STOP : 145 

Feel free to comment and follow.

In all this is a great investment for long term

On this occasion we are looking for an entry in the XMR and USD parity to open a long position that takes us to a price of around 152 USD.  

We have to be aware of the confirmation of buying signal that is currently developing.  

Buy strategy: 
1) The price (candle) closed above the Kijun (pink line) is a well-known strategy using  Ichimoku . 
2) But, we prefer a confirmation, then we wait for Tenkan (blue line) crossing Kijun (pink line). 

MACD+DI also can provide us further confirmation of the signal (green points). 
The  RSI  is currently above 50. It is an indication of a  bullish  market.  

Our target is 152 USD. And our Stop Loss, 113 USD. The SL is determined by the support offered by the lower line of the Kumo (cloud).  

Stay tuned of any changes and good luck!

You can use the RSI as a trend reversal indicator and should expect a rebound from the 45 - 50 levels. The RSI should be kept in the upward half of the chart to validate a bearish reversal. If the latter does not occur, consider selling according to your risk level.

One version of the story has the emperor going bankrupt as the 63 doublings ultimately totaled 18 million trillion grains of rice. At ten grains of rice per square inch, this requires rice fields covering twice the surface area of the Earth, oceans included. Another version of the story has the inventor losing his head.

					Quoted for possible truth:  

""It's not about HW wallets or anything, XMR is being price suppressed because big players are accumulating it big time. As someone said smart money is well aware of monero and they want to keep it as much as they can for themselves until inflation is low and they can mark the price way up 

Didn't you guys notice we always are the last to pump ? its because pump happen in hierarchical orders, first you get the shittest of the the shitcoins with the wierd names like GROESTLECOIN and so on, then you got noob coins and strange coins and semi good coins, and when smart money has taken dumb money for as much as they can they pump XMR because they need to store their accumulated wealth somewhere, and whats the better place than monero? 

Next year, we'll be at 4% inflation, this is bitcoin level now, and then quickly we'll be under bitcoin yearly inflation... this will be the time to mark up the price BIG TIME, I'm talking BTC current level 

This is a slow play, this is like poker when you got quad aces and you want to take as much as you can from the noobs, you take your time, you let dumb money bids and buy DRAGONCHAIN and then you put your profit back into XMR.  

RINSE and REPEAT until we're at 2-3% inflation and price is above 10K and doesn't come back. ""

This is my idea for Monero. In my eyes XMR is the leader when it comes to private crypto transactions. However, 
I am not sure how big of an impact regulations will have on privacy coins. This idea is just based on previous chart patterns without considering fundamentals.

I tried to make a good reflection of the whole cryptomarket. I only could do this with coins that been trading for more than a year. Otherwise the chart did not work. So I made a chart with the following coins: 
BTC             , ETH, XRP, LTC, DASH, NEO, MONERO,  XEM             

If people also wanna chart on this chart use the following ticker:

About the charts 
The first chart you see is on the logic alghoritme. The second one in normal view. 

On the first alghoritme we see a big rising wedge! On the second one you see the beautifull elliot-wave pattern. The 5th wave or 3th wave up reached the 1.618 fibonacci level, the same level als the last crash.  

I think there could be an abc-correction wave. With a total retracement of the whole cryptocurrancy market of 35-55%. 

Some other information to think about. Correct me when i'm wrong! 
First crash:  
-20 june the total marketcap of cryptocurrancies was 115 million.  
-16 july the total marketcap of cryptocurrancies 67 million  

Trigger: The first  bitcoin              fork?  

Second crash:  
-1 september the total marketcap of cryptocurrancies was 174 million.  
-15 september the total marketcap of cryptocurrancies was 109 million.  

Trigger: China Ban?  

The last and upcomming crash>  
It should be time for a correction of the total market! I think there is a huge change.  

Trigger: I really think the Tether usd hack could trigger a crash.  

Last thing I want to say, I try to do an objective view. I believe it will happen. You don't have to agree with me, take your own conclusion!

Total marketcap: 54.000.000.000 / 44% = 122.727.000.000 usd 
Bitcoin: 122.727.000.000 - 54.000.000.000 = 68.727.000.000 usd

Hello guys, 

XMR has reached it's bottom and if 150USD stays unbroken, we can clearly assume it. It may move to the upper downtrend line in few days. 

Target date is around June 15th. As you can see, there is always 50 days between each high. 

Let's see if this pattern plays out again ! If so, there is a nice 20% to make ! :)

Monero is a great privacy coin with around 2X - 10X possibility this year  

We are leaning more towards 8X - 10X however due to numerous privacy coins entering larger market, we might see slower price growth  

In all this is a great investment for long term

On this occasion we are looking for an entry in the XMR and USD parity to open a long position that takes us to a price of around 152 USD.  

We have to be aware of the confirmation of buying signal that is currently developing.  

Buy strategy: 
1) The price (candle) closed above the Kijun (pink line) is a well-known strategy using  Ichimoku . 
2) But, we prefer a confirmation, then we wait for Tenkan (blue line) crossing Kijun (pink line). 

MACD+DI also can provide us further confirmation of the signal (green points). 
The  RSI  is currently above 50. It is an indication of a  bullish  market.  

Our target is 152 USD. And our Stop Loss, 113 USD. The SL is determined by the support offered by the lower line of the Kumo (cloud).  

Stay tuned of any changes and good luck!

You can use the RSI as a trend reversal indicator and should expect a rebound from the 45 - 50 levels. The RSI should be kept in the upward half of the chart to validate a bearish reversal. If the latter does not occur, consider selling according to your risk level.

One version of the story has the emperor going bankrupt as the 63 doublings ultimately totaled 18 million trillion grains of rice. At ten grains of rice per square inch, this requires rice fields covering twice the surface area of the Earth, oceans included. Another version of the story has the inventor losing his head.

""It's not about HW wallets or anything, XMR is being price suppressed because big players are accumulating it big time. As someone said smart money is well aware of monero and they want to keep it as much as they can for themselves until inflation is low and they can mark the price way up 

Didn't you guys notice we always are the last to pump ? its because pump happen in hierarchical orders, first you get the shittest of the the shitcoins with the wierd names like GROESTLECOIN and so on, then you got noob coins and strange coins and semi good coins, and when smart money has taken dumb money for as much as they can they pump XMR because they need to store their accumulated wealth somewhere, and whats the better place than monero? 

Next year, we'll be at 4% inflation, this is bitcoin level now, and then quickly we'll be under bitcoin yearly inflation... this will be the time to mark up the price BIG TIME, I'm talking BTC current level 

This is a slow play, this is like poker when you got quad aces and you want to take as much as you can from the noobs, you take your time, you let dumb money bids and buy DRAGONCHAIN and then you put your profit back into XMR.  

RINSE and REPEAT until we're at 2-3% inflation and price is above 10K and doesn't come back. ""

This is my idea for Monero. In my eyes XMR is the leader when it comes to private crypto transactions. However, 
I am not sure how big of an impact regulations will have on privacy coins. This idea is just based on previous chart patterns without considering fundamentals.

I tried to make a good reflection of the whole cryptomarket. I only could do this with coins that been trading for more than a year. Otherwise the chart did not work. So I made a chart with the following coins: 
BTC -1.69% , ETH, XRP, LTC, DASH, NEO, MONERO,  XEM -1.35% 

If people also wanna chart on this chart use the following ticker: 
COINBASE:BTCUSD*16692550+BITFINEX:ETHUSD*92862174+BITTREX:XRPUSD*38622892459+BITFINEX:LTCUSD*53927233+BITTREX:DASHUSD*7701656+BITTREX:NEOUSD*65000000+BITTREX:XMRUSD*15377976+BITTREX:XEMUSD*8999999999 

About the charts 
The first chart you see is on the logic alghoritme. The second one in normal view. 

On the first alghoritme we see a big rising wedge! On the second one you see the beautifull elliot-wave pattern. The 5th wave or 3th wave up reached the 1.618 fibonacci level, the same level als the last crash.  

I think there could be an abc-correction wave. With a total retracement of the whole cryptocurrancy market of 35-55%. 

Some other information to think about. Correct me when i'm wrong! 
First crash:  
-20 june the total marketcap of cryptocurrancies was 115 million.  
-16 july the total marketcap of cryptocurrancies 67 million  

Trigger: The first  bitcoin -1.69%  fork?  

Second crash:  
-1 september the total marketcap of cryptocurrancies was 174 million.  
-15 september the total marketcap of cryptocurrancies was 109 million.  

Trigger: China Ban?  

The last and upcomming crash>  
It should be time for a correction of the total market! I think there is a huge change.  

Trigger: I really think the Tether usd hack could trigger a crash.  

Last thing I want to say, I try to do an objective view. I believe it will happen. You don't have to agree with me, take your own conclusion!

The bitcoin dominance is 56%. So the total marketcap of the other coins should be 44%. 

Total marketcap: 54.000.000.000 / 44% = 122.727.000.000 usd 
Bitcoin: 122.727.000.000 - 54.000.000.000 = 68.727.000.000 usd

Hello guys, 

XMR has reached it's bottom and if 150USD stays unbroken, we can clearly assume it. It may move to the upper downtrend line in few days. 

Target date is around June 15th. As you can see, there is always 50 days between each high. 

Let's see if this pattern plays out again ! If so, there is a nice 20% to make ! :) 

BUY : 150 - 160 
SELL : 200 - 220 
STOP : 145

On this occasion we are looking for an entry in the XMR and USD parity to open a long position that takes us to a price of around 152 USD.  

We have to be aware of the confirmation of buying signal that is currently developing.  

Buy strategy: 
1) The price (candle) closed above the Kijun (pink line) is a well-known strategy using  Ichimoku . 
2) But, we prefer a confirmation, then we wait for Tenkan (blue line) crossing Kijun (pink line). 

MACD+DI also can provide us further confirmation of the signal (green points). 
The  RSI  is currently above 50. It is an indication of a  bullish  market.  

Our target is 152 USD. And our Stop Loss, 113 USD. The SL is determined by the support offered by the lower line of the Kumo (cloud).  

Stay tuned of any changes and good luck!

You can use the RSI as a trend reversal indicator and should expect a rebound from the 45 - 50 levels. The RSI should be kept in the upward half of the chart to validate a bearish reversal. If the latter does not occur, consider selling according to your risk level.

Comment:
					Quoted for possible truth:  

""It's not about HW wallets or anything, XMR is being price suppressed because big players are accumulating it big time. As someone said smart money is well aware of monero and they want to keep it as much as they can for themselves until inflation is low and they can mark the price way up 

Didn't you guys notice we always are the last to pump ? its because pump happen in hierarchical orders, first you get the shittest of the the shitcoins with the wierd names like GROESTLECOIN and so on, then you got noob coins and strange coins and semi good coins, and when smart money has taken dumb money for as much as they can they pump XMR because they need to store their accumulated wealth somewhere, and whats the better place than monero? 

Next year, we'll be at 4% inflation, this is bitcoin level now, and then quickly we'll be under bitcoin yearly inflation... this will be the time to mark up the price BIG TIME, I'm talking BTC current level 

This is a slow play, this is like poker when you got quad aces and you want to take as much as you can from the noobs, you take your time, you let dumb money bids and buy DRAGONCHAIN and then you put your profit back into XMR.  

RINSE and REPEAT until we're at 2-3% inflation and price is above 10K and doesn't come back. ""

This is my idea for Monero. In my eyes XMR is the leader when it comes to private crypto transactions. However, 
I am not sure how big of an impact regulations will have on privacy coins. This idea is just based on previous chart patterns without considering fundamentals.

Nov 21, 2017




I tried to make a good reflection of the whole cryptomarket. I only could do this with coins that been trading for more than a year. Otherwise the chart did not work. So I made a chart with the following coins: 
BTC             , ETH, XRP, LTC, DASH, NEO, MONERO,  XEM             

If people also wanna chart on this chart use the following ticker: 
COINBASE:BTCUSD*16692550+BITFINEX:ETHUSD*92862174+BITTREX:XRPUSD*38622892459+BITFINEX:LTCUSD*53927233+BITTREX:DASHUSD*7701656+BITTREX:NEOUSD*65000000+BITTREX:XMRUSD*15377976+BITTREX:XEMUSD*8999999999 

About the charts 
The first chart you see is on the logic alghoritme. The second one in normal view. 

On the first alghoritme we see a big rising wedge! On the second one you see the beautifull elliot-wave pattern. The 5th wave or 3th wave up reached the 1.618 fibonacci level, the same level als the last crash.  

I think there could be an abc-correction wave. With a total retracement of the whole cryptocurrancy market of 35-55%. 

Some other information to think about. Correct me when i'm wrong! 
First crash:  
-20 june the total marketcap of cryptocurrancies was 115 million.  
-16 july the total marketcap of cryptocurrancies 67 million  

Trigger: The first  bitcoin              fork?  

Second crash:  
-1 september the total marketcap of cryptocurrancies was 174 million.  
-15 september the total marketcap of cryptocurrancies was 109 million.  

Trigger: China Ban?  

The last and upcomming crash>  
It should be time for a correction of the total market! I think there is a huge change.  

Trigger: I really think the Tether usd hack could trigger a crash.  

Last thing I want to say, I try to do an objective view. I believe it will happen. You don't have to agree with me, take your own conclusion!

The bitcoin dominance is 56%. So the total marketcap of the other coins should be 44%. 

Total marketcap: 54.000.000.000 / 44% = 122.727.000.000 usd 
Bitcoin: 122.727.000.000 - 54.000.000.000 = 68.727.000.000 usd 

So the bitcoin should multiplied by 68.727.000.000 / 138.000.000.000 = 50%

Hello guys, 

XMR has reached it's bottom and if 150USD stays unbroken, we can clearly assume it. It may move to the upper downtrend line in few days. 

Target date is around June 15th. As you can see, there is always 50 days between each high. 

Let's see if this pattern plays out again ! If so, there is a nice 20% to make ! :) 

BUY : 150 - 160 
SELL : 200 - 220 
STOP : 145 

Feel free to comment and follow.  

Cheers,

On this occasion we are looking for an entry in the XMR and USD parity to open a long position that takes us to a price of around 152 USD.

2) But, we prefer a confirmation, then we wait for Tenkan (blue line) crossing Kijun (pink line).

					Quoted for possible truth:  

""It's not about HW wallets or anything, XMR is being price suppressed because big players are accumulating it big time. As someone said smart money is well aware of monero and they want to keep it as much as they can for themselves until inflation is low and they can mark the price way up 

Didn't you guys notice we always are the last to pump ? its because pump happen in hierarchical orders, first you get the shittest of the the shitcoins with the wierd names like GROESTLECOIN and so on, then you got noob coins and strange coins and semi good coins, and when smart money has taken dumb money for as much as they can they pump XMR because they need to store their accumulated wealth somewhere, and whats the better place than monero? 

Next year, we'll be at 4% inflation, this is bitcoin level now, and then quickly we'll be under bitcoin yearly inflation... this will be the time to mark up the price BIG TIME, I'm talking BTC current level 

This is a slow play, this is like poker when you got quad aces and you want to take as much as you can from the noobs, you take your time, you let dumb money bids and buy DRAGONCHAIN and then you put your profit back into XMR.  

RINSE and REPEAT until we're at 2-3% inflation and price is above 10K and doesn't come back. ""

This is my idea for Monero. In my eyes XMR is the leader when it comes to private crypto transactions. However, 
I am not sure how big of an impact regulations will have on privacy coins. This idea is just based on previous chart patterns without considering fundamentals.

Nov 21, 2017




I tried to make a good reflection of the whole cryptomarket. I only could do this with coins that been trading for more than a year. Otherwise the chart did not work. So I made a chart with the following coins: 
BTC             , ETH, XRP, LTC, DASH, NEO, MONERO,  XEM             

If people also wanna chart on this chart use the following ticker: 
COINBASE:BTCUSD*16692550+BITFINEX:ETHUSD*92862174+BITTREX:XRPUSD*38622892459+BITFINEX:LTCUSD*53927233+BITTREX:DASHUSD*7701656+BITTREX:NEOUSD*65000000+BITTREX:XMRUSD*15377976+BITTREX:XEMUSD*8999999999 

About the charts 
The first chart you see is on the logic alghoritme. The second one in normal view. 

On the first alghoritme we see a big rising wedge! On the second one you see the beautifull elliot-wave pattern. The 5th wave or 3th wave up reached the 1.618 fibonacci level, the same level als the last crash.  

I think there could be an abc-correction wave. With a total retracement of the whole cryptocurrancy market of 35-55%. 

Some other information to think about. Correct me when i'm wrong! 
First crash:  
-20 june the total marketcap of cryptocurrancies was 115 million.  
-16 july the total marketcap of cryptocurrancies 67 million  

Trigger: The first  bitcoin              fork?  

Second crash:  
-1 september the total marketcap of cryptocurrancies was 174 million.  
-15 september the total marketcap of cryptocurrancies was 109 million.  

Trigger: China Ban?  

The last and upcomming crash>  
It should be time for a correction of the total market! I think there is a huge change.  

Trigger: I really think the Tether usd hack could trigger a crash.  

Last thing I want to say, I try to do an objective view. I believe it will happen. You don't have to agree with me, take your own conclusion!

The bitcoin dominance is 56%. So the total marketcap of the other coins should be 44%. 

Total marketcap: 54.000.000.000 / 44% = 122.727.000.000 usd 
Bitcoin: 122.727.000.000 - 54.000.000.000 = 68.727.000.000 usd 

So the bitcoin should multiplied by 68.727.000.000 / 138.000.000.000 = 50%

Hello guys, 

XMR has reached it's bottom and if 150USD stays unbroken, we can clearly assume it. It may move to the upper downtrend line in few days. 

Target date is around June 15th. As you can see, there is always 50 days between each high. 

Let's see if this pattern plays out again ! If so, there is a nice 20% to make ! :) 

BUY : 150 - 160 
SELL : 200 - 220 
STOP : 145 

Feel free to comment and follow.  

Cheers,

- EMA 10 (fast) above EMA 70 (slow)

Monero is a great privacy coin with around 2X - 10X possibility this year  

We are leaning more towards 8X - 10X however due to numerous privacy coins entering larger market, we might see slower price growth  

In all this is a great investment for long term

On this occasion we are looking for an entry in the XMR and USD parity to open a long position that takes us to a price of around 152 USD.  

We have to be aware of the confirmation of buying signal that is currently developing.  

Buy strategy: 
1) The price (candle) closed above the Kijun (pink line) is a well-known strategy using  Ichimoku . 
2) But, we prefer a confirmation, then we wait for Tenkan (blue line) crossing Kijun (pink line). 

MACD+DI also can provide us further confirmation of the signal (green points). 
The  RSI  is currently above 50. It is an indication of a  bullish  market.  

Our target is 152 USD. And our Stop Loss, 113 USD. The SL is determined by the support offered by the lower line of the Kumo (cloud).  

Stay tuned of any changes and good luck!

					XMR could not stand the rise of BTC. As a result, XMR lost its bullish trend in time frames shorter than 1 hour. 

You can use the RSI as a trend reversal indicator and should expect a rebound from the 45 - 50 levels. The RSI should be kept in the upward half of the chart to validate a bearish reversal. If the latter does not occur, consider selling according to your risk level.

This is my idea for Monero. In my eyes XMR is the leader when it comes to private crypto transactions. However, 
I am not sure how big of an impact regulations will have on privacy coins. This idea is just based on previous chart patterns without considering fundamentals.

Nov 21, 2017




I tried to make a good reflection of the whole cryptomarket. I only could do this with coins that been trading for more than a year. Otherwise the chart did not work. So I made a chart with the following coins: 
BTC -1.69% , ETH, XRP, LTC, DASH, NEO, MONERO,  XEM -1.35% 

If people also wanna chart on this chart use the following ticker: 
COINBASE:BTCUSD*16692550+BITFINEX:ETHUSD*92862174+BITTREX:XRPUSD*38622892459+BITFINEX:LTCUSD*53927233+BITTREX:DASHUSD*7701656+BITTREX:NEOUSD*65000000+BITTREX:XMRUSD*15377976+BITTREX:XEMUSD*8999999999 

About the charts 
The first chart you see is on the logic alghoritme. The second one in normal view. 

On the first alghoritme we see a big rising wedge! On the second one you see the beautifull elliot-wave pattern. The 5th wave or 3th wave up reached the 1.618 fibonacci level, the same level als the last crash.  

I think there could be an abc-correction wave. With a total retracement of the whole cryptocurrancy market of 35-55%. 

Some other information to think about. Correct me when i'm wrong! 
First crash:  
-20 june the total marketcap of cryptocurrancies was 115 million.  
-16 july the total marketcap of cryptocurrancies 67 million  

Trigger: The first  bitcoin -1.69%  fork?  

Second crash:  
-1 september the total marketcap of cryptocurrancies was 174 million.  
-15 september the total marketcap of cryptocurrancies was 109 million.  

Trigger: China Ban?  

The last and upcomming crash>  
It should be time for a correction of the total market! I think there is a huge change.  

Trigger: I really think the Tether usd hack could trigger a crash.  

Last thing I want to say, I try to do an objective view. I believe it will happen. You don't have to agree with me, take your own conclusion!

The bitcoin dominance is 56%. So the total marketcap of the other coins should be 44%. 

Total marketcap: 54.000.000.000 / 44% = 122.727.000.000 usd 
Bitcoin: 122.727.000.000 - 54.000.000.000 = 68.727.000.000 usd 

So the bitcoin should multiplied by 68.727.000.000 / 138.000.000.000 = 50%

Hello guys, 

XMR has reached it's bottom and if 150USD stays unbroken, we can clearly assume it. It may move to the upper downtrend line in few days. 

Target date is around June 15th. As you can see, there is always 50 days between each high. 

Let's see if this pattern plays out again ! If so, there is a nice 20% to make ! :) 

BUY : 150 - 160 
SELL : 200 - 220 
STOP : 145 

Feel free to comment and follow.  

Cheers,

On this occasion we are looking for an entry in the XMR and USD parity to open a long position that takes us to a price of around 152 USD.  

We have to be aware of the confirmation of buying signal that is currently developing.  

Buy strategy: 
1) The price (candle) closed above the Kijun (pink line) is a well-known strategy using  Ichimoku . 
2) But, we prefer a confirmation, then we wait for Tenkan (blue line) crossing Kijun (pink line). 

MACD+DI also can provide us further confirmation of the signal (green points). 
The  RSI  is currently above 50. It is an indication of a  bullish  market.  

Our target is 152 USD. And our Stop Loss, 113 USD. The SL is determined by the support offered by the lower line of the Kumo (cloud).  

Stay tuned of any changes and good luck!

You can use the RSI as a trend reversal indicator and should expect a rebound from the 45 - 50 levels. The RSI should be kept in the upward half of the chart to validate a bearish reversal. If the latter does not occur, consider selling according to your risk level.

""It's not about HW wallets or anything, XMR is being price suppressed because big players are accumulating it big time. As someone said smart money is well aware of monero and they want to keep it as much as they can for themselves until inflation is low and they can mark the price way up 

Didn't you guys notice we always are the last to pump ? its because pump happen in hierarchical orders, first you get the shittest of the the shitcoins with the wierd names like GROESTLECOIN and so on, then you got noob coins and strange coins and semi good coins, and when smart money has taken dumb money for as much as they can they pump XMR because they need to store their accumulated wealth somewhere, and whats the better place than monero? 

Next year, we'll be at 4% inflation, this is bitcoin level now, and then quickly we'll be under bitcoin yearly inflation... this will be the time to mark up the price BIG TIME, I'm talking BTC current level 

This is a slow play, this is like poker when you got quad aces and you want to take as much as you can from the noobs, you take your time, you let dumb money bids and buy DRAGONCHAIN and then you put your profit back into XMR.  

RINSE and REPEAT until we're at 2-3% inflation and price is above 10K and doesn't come back. ""

About the charts 
The first chart you see is on the logic alghoritme. The second one in normal view. 

On the first alghoritme we see a big rising wedge! On the second one you see the beautifull elliot-wave pattern. The 5th wave or 3th wave up reached the 1.618 fibonacci level, the same level als the last crash.  

I think there could be an abc-correction wave. With a total retracement of the whole cryptocurrancy market of 35-55%. 

Some other information to think about. Correct me when i'm wrong! 
First crash:  
-20 june the total marketcap of cryptocurrancies was 115 million.  
-16 july the total marketcap of cryptocurrancies 67 million  

Trigger: The first  bitcoin              fork?  

Second crash:  
-1 september the total marketcap of cryptocurrancies was 174 million.  
-15 september the total marketcap of cryptocurrancies was 109 million.  

Trigger: China Ban?  

The last and upcomming crash>  
It should be time for a correction of the total market! I think there is a huge change.  

Trigger: I really think the Tether usd hack could trigger a crash.  

Last thing I want to say, I try to do an objective view. I believe it will happen. You don't have to agree with me, take your own conclusion!

The bitcoin dominance is 56%. So the total marketcap of the other coins should be 44%. 

Total marketcap: 54.000.000.000 / 44% = 122.727.000.000 usd 
Bitcoin: 122.727.000.000 - 54.000.000.000 = 68.727.000.000 usd 

So the bitcoin should multiplied by 68.727.000.000 / 138.000.000.000 = 50%

Hello guys, 

XMR has reached it's bottom and if 150USD stays unbroken, we can clearly assume it. It may move to the upper downtrend line in few days. 

Target date is around June 15th. As you can see, there is always 50 days between each high. 

Let's see if this pattern plays out again ! If so, there is a nice 20% to make ! :) 

BUY : 150 - 160 
SELL : 200 - 220 
STOP : 145 

Feel free to comment and follow.  

Cheers,

In all this is a great investment for long term

On this occasion we are looking for an entry in the XMR and USD parity to open a long position that takes us to a price of around 152 USD.  

We have to be aware of the confirmation of buying signal that is currently developing.  

Buy strategy: 
1) The price (candle) closed above the Kijun (pink line) is a well-known strategy using  Ichimoku . 
2) But, we prefer a confirmation, then we wait for Tenkan (blue line) crossing Kijun (pink line). 

MACD+DI also can provide us further confirmation of the signal (green points). 
The  RSI  is currently above 50. It is an indication of a  bullish  market.  

Our target is 152 USD. And our Stop Loss, 113 USD. The SL is determined by the support offered by the lower line of the Kumo (cloud).  

Stay tuned of any changes and good luck!

You can use the RSI as a trend reversal indicator and should expect a rebound from the 45 - 50 levels. The RSI should be kept in the upward half of the chart to validate a bearish reversal. If the latter does not occur, consider selling according to your risk level.

In response to the emperor’s offer of a reward for his new beloved game, the inventor asked for a single grain of rice on the first square, two on the second square, four on the third, and so on. The Emperor quickly granted this seemingly benign and humble request. 

One version of the story has the emperor going bankrupt as the 63 doublings ultimately totaled 18 million trillion grains of rice. At ten grains of rice per square inch, this requires rice fields covering twice the surface area of the Earth, oceans included. Another version of the story has the inventor losing his head.

					Quoted for possible truth:  

""It's not about HW wallets or anything, XMR is being price suppressed because big players are accumulating it big time. As someone said smart money is well aware of monero and they want to keep it as much as they can for themselves until inflation is low and they can mark the price way up 

Didn't you guys notice we always are the last to pump ? its because pump happen in hierarchical orders, first you get the shittest of the the shitcoins with the wierd names like GROESTLECOIN and so on, then you got noob coins and strange coins and semi good coins, and when smart money has taken dumb money for as much as they can they pump XMR because they need to store their accumulated wealth somewhere, and whats the better place than monero? 

Next year, we'll be at 4% inflation, this is bitcoin level now, and then quickly we'll be under bitcoin yearly inflation... this will be the time to mark up the price BIG TIME, I'm talking BTC current level 

This is a slow play, this is like poker when you got quad aces and you want to take as much as you can from the noobs, you take your time, you let dumb money bids and buy DRAGONCHAIN and then you put your profit back into XMR.  

RINSE and REPEAT until we're at 2-3% inflation and price is above 10K and doesn't come back. ""

This is my idea for Monero. In my eyes XMR is the leader when it comes to private crypto transactions. However, 
I am not sure how big of an impact regulations will have on privacy coins. This idea is just based on previous chart patterns without considering fundamentals.

Bitcoin: 122.727.000.000 - 54.000.000.000 = 68.727.000.000 usd

Hello guys, 

XMR has reached it's bottom and if 150USD stays unbroken, we can clearly assume it. It may move to the upper downtrend line in few days. 

Target date is around June 15th. As you can see, there is always 50 days between each high. 

Let's see if this pattern plays out again ! If so, there is a nice 20% to make ! :) 

BUY : 150 - 160 
SELL : 200 - 220 
STOP : 145 

Feel free to comment and follow.  

Cheers,

Monero is a great privacy coin with around 2X - 10X possibility this year  

We are leaning more towards 8X - 10X however due to numerous privacy coins entering larger market, we might see slower price growth  

In all this is a great investment for long term

On this occasion we are looking for an entry in the XMR and USD parity to open a long position that takes us to a price of around 152 USD.  

We have to be aware of the confirmation of buying signal that is currently developing.  

Buy strategy: 
1) The price (candle) closed above the Kijun (pink line) is a well-known strategy using  Ichimoku . 
2) But, we prefer a confirmation, then we wait for Tenkan (blue line) crossing Kijun (pink line). 

MACD+DI also can provide us further confirmation of the signal (green points). 
The  RSI  is currently above 50. It is an indication of a  bullish  market.  

Our target is 152 USD. And our Stop Loss, 113 USD. The SL is determined by the support offered by the lower line of the Kumo (cloud).  

Stay tuned of any changes and good luck!

You can use the RSI as a trend reversal indicator and should expect a rebound from the 45 - 50 levels. The RSI should be kept in the upward half of the chart to validate a bearish reversal. If the latter does not occur, consider selling according to your risk level.

One version of the story has the emperor going bankrupt as the 63 doublings ultimately totaled 18 million trillion grains of rice. At ten grains of rice per square inch, this requires rice fields covering twice the surface area of the Earth, oceans included. Another version of the story has the inventor losing his head.

					Quoted for possible truth:  

""It's not about HW wallets or anything, XMR is being price suppressed because big players are accumulating it big time. As someone said smart money is well aware of monero and they want to keep it as much as they can for themselves until inflation is low and they can mark the price way up 

Didn't you guys notice we always are the last to pump ? its because pump happen in hierarchical orders, first you get the shittest of the the shitcoins with the wierd names like GROESTLECOIN and so on, then you got noob coins and strange coins and semi good coins, and when smart money has taken dumb money for as much as they can they pump XMR because they need to store their accumulated wealth somewhere, and whats the better place than monero? 

Next year, we'll be at 4% inflation, this is bitcoin level now, and then quickly we'll be under bitcoin yearly inflation... this will be the time to mark up the price BIG TIME, I'm talking BTC current level 

This is a slow play, this is like poker when you got quad aces and you want to take as much as you can from the noobs, you take your time, you let dumb money bids and buy DRAGONCHAIN and then you put your profit back into XMR.  

RINSE and REPEAT until we're at 2-3% inflation and price is above 10K and doesn't come back. ""

This is my idea for Monero. In my eyes XMR is the leader when it comes to private crypto transactions. However, 
I am not sure how big of an impact regulations will have on privacy coins. This idea is just based on previous chart patterns without considering fundamentals.

I tried to make a good reflection of the whole cryptomarket. I only could do this with coins that been trading for more than a year. Otherwise the chart did not work. So I made a chart with the following coins: 
BTC -1.59% , ETH, XRP, LTC, DASH, NEO, MONERO,  XEM -1.35% 

If people also wanna chart on this chart use the following ticker: 
COINBASE:BTCUSD*16692550+BITFINEX:ETHUSD*92862174+BITTREX:XRPUSD*38622892459+BITFINEX:LTCUSD*53927233+BITTREX:DASHUSD*7701656+BITTREX:NEOUSD*65000000+BITTREX:XMRUSD*15377976+BITTREX:XEMUSD*8999999999 

About the charts 
The first chart you see is on the logic alghoritme. The second one in normal view. 

On the first alghoritme we see a big rising wedge! On the second one you see the beautifull elliot-wave pattern. The 5th wave or 3th wave up reached the 1.618 fibonacci level, the same level als the last crash.  

I think there could be an abc-correction wave. With a total retracement of the whole cryptocurrancy market of 35-55%. 

Some other information to think about. Correct me when i'm wrong! 
First crash:  
-20 june the total marketcap of cryptocurrancies was 115 million.  
-16 july the total marketcap of cryptocurrancies 67 million  

Trigger: The first  bitcoin -1.59%  fork?  

Second crash:  
-1 september the total marketcap of cryptocurrancies was 174 million.  
-15 september the total marketcap of cryptocurrancies was 109 million.  

Trigger: China Ban?  

The last and upcomming crash>  
It should be time for a correction of the total market! I think there is a huge change.  

Trigger: I really think the Tether usd hack could trigger a crash.  

Last thing I want to say, I try to do an objective view. I believe it will happen. You don't have to agree with me, take your own conclusion!

The bitcoin dominance is 56%. So the total marketcap of the other coins should be 44%. 

Total marketcap: 54.000.000.000 / 44% = 122.727.000.000 usd 
Bitcoin: 122.727.000.000 - 54.000.000.000 = 68.727.000.000 usd 

So the bitcoin should multiplied by 68.727.000.000 / 138.000.000.000 = 50%

Hello guys, 

XMR has reached it's bottom and if 150USD stays unbroken, we can clearly assume it. It may move to the upper downtrend line in few days. 

Target date is around June 15th. As you can see, there is always 50 days between each high. 

Let's see if this pattern plays out again ! If so, there is a nice 20% to make ! :)

On this occasion we are looking for an entry in the XMR and USD parity to open a long position that takes us to a price of around 152 USD.  

We have to be aware of the confirmation of buying signal that is currently developing.  

Buy strategy: 
1) The price (candle) closed above the Kijun (pink line) is a well-known strategy using  Ichimoku . 
2) But, we prefer a confirmation, then we wait for Tenkan (blue line) crossing Kijun (pink line). 

MACD+DI also can provide us further confirmation of the signal (green points). 
The  RSI  is currently above 50. It is an indication of a  bullish  market.  

Our target is 152 USD. And our Stop Loss, 113 USD. The SL is determined by the support offered by the lower line of the Kumo (cloud).  

Stay tuned of any changes and good luck!

You can use the RSI as a trend reversal indicator and should expect a rebound from the 45 - 50 levels. The RSI should be kept in the upward half of the chart to validate a bearish reversal. If the latter does not occur, consider selling according to your risk level.

One version of the story has the emperor going bankrupt as the 63 doublings ultimately totaled 18 million trillion grains of rice. At ten grains of rice per square inch, this requires rice fields covering twice the surface area of the Earth, oceans included. Another version of the story has the inventor losing his head.

					Quoted for possible truth:  

""It's not about HW wallets or anything, XMR is being price suppressed because big players are accumulating it big time. As someone said smart money is well aware of monero and they want to keep it as much as they can for themselves until inflation is low and they can mark the price way up 

Didn't you guys notice we always are the last to pump ? its because pump happen in hierarchical orders, first you get the shittest of the the shitcoins with the wierd names like GROESTLECOIN and so on, then you got noob coins and strange coins and semi good coins, and when smart money has taken dumb money for as much as they can they pump XMR because they need to store their accumulated wealth somewhere, and whats the better place than monero? 

Next year, we'll be at 4% inflation, this is bitcoin level now, and then quickly we'll be under bitcoin yearly inflation... this will be the time to mark up the price BIG TIME, I'm talking BTC current level 

This is a slow play, this is like poker when you got quad aces and you want to take as much as you can from the noobs, you take your time, you let dumb money bids and buy DRAGONCHAIN and then you put your profit back into XMR.  

RINSE and REPEAT until we're at 2-3% inflation and price is above 10K and doesn't come back. ""

This is my idea for Monero. In my eyes XMR is the leader when it comes to private crypto transactions. However, 
I am not sure how big of an impact regulations will have on privacy coins. This idea is just based on previous chart patterns without considering fundamentals.

I tried to make a good reflection of the whole cryptomarket. I only could do this with coins that been trading for more than a year. Otherwise the chart did not work. So I made a chart with the following coins: 
BTC             , ETH, XRP, LTC, DASH, NEO, MONERO,  XEM             

If people also wanna chart on this chart use the following ticker: 
COINBASE:BTCUSD*16692550+BITFINEX:ETHUSD*92862174+BITTREX:XRPUSD*38622892459+BITFINEX:LTCUSD*53927233+BITTREX:DASHUSD*7701656+BITTREX:NEOUSD*65000000+BITTREX:XMRUSD*15377976+BITTREX:XEMUSD*8999999999 

About the charts 
The first chart you see is on the logic alghoritme. The second one in normal view. 

On the first alghoritme we see a big rising wedge! On the second one you see the beautifull elliot-wave pattern. The 5th wave or 3th wave up reached the 1.618 fibonacci level, the same level als the last crash.  

I think there could be an abc-correction wave. With a total retracement of the whole cryptocurrancy market of 35-55%. 

Some other information to think about. Correct me when i'm wrong! 
First crash:  
-20 june the total marketcap of cryptocurrancies was 115 million.  
-16 july the total marketcap of cryptocurrancies 67 million  

Trigger: The first  bitcoin              fork?  

Second crash:  
-1 september the total marketcap of cryptocurrancies was 174 million.  
-15 september the total marketcap of cryptocurrancies was 109 million.  

Trigger: China Ban?  

The last and upcomming crash>  
It should be time for a correction of the total market! I think there is a huge change.  

Trigger: I really think the Tether usd hack could trigger a crash.  

Last thing I want to say, I try to do an objective view. I believe it will happen. You don't have to agree with me, take your own conclusion!

The bitcoin dominance is 56%. So the total marketcap of the other coins should be 44%. 

Total marketcap: 54.000.000.000 / 44% = 122.727.000.000 usd 
Bitcoin: 122.727.000.000 - 54.000.000.000 = 68.727.000.000 usd 

So the bitcoin should multiplied by 68.727.000.000 / 138.000.000.000 = 50%

Hello guys, 

XMR has reached it's bottom and if 150USD stays unbroken, we can clearly assume it. It may move to the upper downtrend line in few days. 

Target date is around June 15th. As you can see, there is always 50 days between each high. 

Let's see if this pattern plays out again ! If so, there is a nice 20% to make ! :) 

BUY : 150 - 160 
SELL : 200 - 220 
STOP : 145

					XMR could not stand the rise of BTC. As a result, XMR lost its bullish trend in time frames shorter than 1 hour. 

You can use the RSI as a trend reversal indicator and should expect a rebound from the 45 - 50 levels. The RSI should be kept in the upward half of the chart to validate a bearish reversal. If the latter does not occur, consider selling according to your risk level.

					""I am fond of telling the tale of the inventor of chess and his patron, the Emperor of China. 

In response to the emperor’s offer of a reward for his new beloved game, the inventor asked for a single grain of rice on the first square, two on the second square, four on the third, and so on. The Emperor quickly granted this seemingly benign and humble request. 

One version of the story has the emperor going bankrupt as the 63 doublings ultimately totaled 18 million trillion grains of rice. At ten grains of rice per square inch, this requires rice fields covering twice the surface area of the Earth, oceans included. Another version of the story has the inventor losing his head.

Comment:
					Quoted for possible truth:  

""It's not about HW wallets or anything, XMR is being price suppressed because big players are accumulating it big time. As someone said smart money is well aware of monero and they want to keep it as much as they can for themselves until inflation is low and they can mark the price way up 

Didn't you guys notice we always are the last to pump ? its because pump happen in hierarchical orders, first you get the shittest of the the shitcoins with the wierd names like GROESTLECOIN and so on, then you got noob coins and strange coins and semi good coins, and when smart money has taken dumb money for as much as they can they pump XMR because they need to store their accumulated wealth somewhere, and whats the better place than monero? 

Next year, we'll be at 4% inflation, this is bitcoin level now, and then quickly we'll be under bitcoin yearly inflation... this will be the time to mark up the price BIG TIME, I'm talking BTC current level 

This is a slow play, this is like poker when you got quad aces and you want to take as much as you can from the noobs, you take your time, you let dumb money bids and buy DRAGONCHAIN and then you put your profit back into XMR.  

RINSE and REPEAT until we're at 2-3% inflation and price is above 10K and doesn't come back. ""

This is my idea for Monero. In my eyes XMR is the leader when it comes to private crypto transactions. However, 
I am not sure how big of an impact regulations will have on privacy coins. This idea is just based on previous chart patterns without considering fundamentals.

Nov 21, 2017




I tried to make a good reflection of the whole cryptomarket. I only could do this with coins that been trading for more than a year. Otherwise the chart did not work. So I made a chart with the following coins: 
BTC -1.59% , ETH, XRP, LTC, DASH, NEO, MONERO,  XEM -1.35% 

If people also wanna chart on this chart use the following ticker: 
COINBASE:BTCUSD*16692550+BITFINEX:ETHUSD*92862174+BITTREX:XRPUSD*38622892459+BITFINEX:LTCUSD*53927233+BITTREX:DASHUSD*7701656+BITTREX:NEOUSD*65000000+BITTREX:XMRUSD*15377976+BITTREX:XEMUSD*8999999999 

About the charts 
The first chart you see is on the logic alghoritme. The second one in normal view. 

On the first alghoritme we see a big rising wedge! On the second one you see the beautifull elliot-wave pattern. The 5th wave or 3th wave up reached the 1.618 fibonacci level, the same level als the last crash.  

I think there could be an abc-correction wave. With a total retracement of the whole cryptocurrancy market of 35-55%. 

Some other information to think about. Correct me when i'm wrong! 
First crash:  
-20 june the total marketcap of cryptocurrancies was 115 million.  
-16 july the total marketcap of cryptocurrancies 67 million  

Trigger: The first  bitcoin -1.59%  fork?  

Second crash:  
-1 september the total marketcap of cryptocurrancies was 174 million.  
-15 september the total marketcap of cryptocurrancies was 109 million.  

Trigger: China Ban?  

The last and upcomming crash>  
It should be time for a correction of the total market! I think there is a huge change.  

Trigger: I really think the Tether usd hack could trigger a crash.  

Last thing I want to say, I try to do an objective view. I believe it will happen. You don't have to agree with me, take your own conclusion!

The bitcoin dominance is 56%. So the total marketcap of the other coins should be 44%. 

Total marketcap: 54.000.000.000 / 44% = 122.727.000.000 usd 
Bitcoin: 122.727.000.000 - 54.000.000.000 = 68.727.000.000 usd 

So the bitcoin should multiplied by 68.727.000.000 / 138.000.000.000 = 50%

Hello guys, 

XMR has reached it's bottom and if 150USD stays unbroken, we can clearly assume it. It may move to the upper downtrend line in few days. 

Target date is around June 15th. As you can see, there is always 50 days between each high. 

Let's see if this pattern plays out again ! If so, there is a nice 20% to make ! :) 

BUY : 150 - 160 
SELL : 200 - 220 
STOP : 145 

Feel free to comment and follow.  

Cheers,

Monero is a great privacy coin with around 2X - 10X possibility this year  

We are leaning more towards 8X - 10X however due to numerous privacy coins entering larger market, we might see slower price growth  

In all this is a great investment for long term

On this occasion we are looking for an entry in the XMR and USD parity to open a long position that takes us to a price of around 152 USD.  

We have to be aware of the confirmation of buying signal that is currently developing.  

Buy strategy: 
1) The price (candle) closed above the Kijun (pink line) is a well-known strategy using  Ichimoku . 
2) But, we prefer a confirmation, then we wait for Tenkan (blue line) crossing Kijun (pink line). 

MACD+DI also can provide us further confirmation of the signal (green points). 
The  RSI  is currently above 50. It is an indication of a  bullish  market.  

Our target is 152 USD. And our Stop Loss, 113 USD. The SL is determined by the support offered by the lower line of the Kumo (cloud).  

Stay tuned of any changes and good luck!

					Quoted for possible truth:  

""It's not about HW wallets or anything, XMR is being price suppressed because big players are accumulating it big time. As someone said smart money is well aware of monero and they want to keep it as much as they can for themselves until inflation is low and they can mark the price way up 

Didn't you guys notice we always are the last to pump ? its because pump happen in hierarchical orders, first you get the shittest of the the shitcoins with the wierd names like GROESTLECOIN and so on, then you got noob coins and strange coins and semi good coins, and when smart money has taken dumb money for as much as they can they pump XMR because they need to store their accumulated wealth somewhere, and whats the better place than monero? 

Next year, we'll be at 4% inflation, this is bitcoin level now, and then quickly we'll be under bitcoin yearly inflation... this will be the time to mark up the price BIG TIME, I'm talking BTC current level 

This is a slow play, this is like poker when you got quad aces and you want to take as much as you can from the noobs, you take your time, you let dumb money bids and buy DRAGONCHAIN and then you put your profit back into XMR.  

RINSE and REPEAT until we're at 2-3% inflation and price is above 10K and doesn't come back. ""

This is my idea for Monero. In my eyes XMR is the leader when it comes to private crypto transactions. However, 
I am not sure how big of an impact regulations will have on privacy coins. This idea is just based on previous chart patterns without considering fundamentals.

Nov 21, 2017




I tried to make a good reflection of the whole cryptomarket. I only could do this with coins that been trading for more than a year. Otherwise the chart did not work. So I made a chart with the following coins: 
BTC -1.46% , ETH, XRP, LTC, DASH, NEO, MONERO,  XEM             

If people also wanna chart on this chart use the following ticker: 
COINBASE:BTCUSD*16692550+BITFINEX:ETHUSD*92862174+BITTREX:XRPUSD*38622892459+BITFINEX:LTCUSD*53927233+BITTREX:DASHUSD*7701656+BITTREX:NEOUSD*65000000+BITTREX:XMRUSD*15377976+BITTREX:XEMUSD*8999999999 

About the charts 
The first chart you see is on the logic alghoritme. The second one in normal view. 

On the first alghoritme we see a big rising wedge! On the second one you see the beautifull elliot-wave pattern. The 5th wave or 3th wave up reached the 1.618 fibonacci level, the same level als the last crash.  

I think there could be an abc-correction wave. With a total retracement of the whole cryptocurrancy market of 35-55%. 

Some other information to think about. Correct me when i'm wrong! 
First crash:  
-20 june the total marketcap of cryptocurrancies was 115 million.  
-16 july the total marketcap of cryptocurrancies 67 million  

Trigger: The first  bitcoin -1.46%  fork?  

Second crash:  
-1 september the total marketcap of cryptocurrancies was 174 million.  
-15 september the total marketcap of cryptocurrancies was 109 million.  

Trigger: China Ban?  

The last and upcomming crash>  
It should be time for a correction of the total market! I think there is a huge change.  

Trigger: I really think the Tether usd hack could trigger a crash.  

Last thing I want to say, I try to do an objective view. I believe it will happen. You don't have to agree with me, take your own conclusion!

The bitcoin dominance is 56%. So the total marketcap of the other coins should be 44%. 

Total marketcap: 54.000.000.000 / 44% = 122.727.000.000 usd 
Bitcoin: 122.727.000.000 - 54.000.000.000 = 68.727.000.000 usd 

So the bitcoin should multiplied by 68.727.000.000 / 138.000.000.000 = 50%

Hello guys, 

XMR has reached it's bottom and if 150USD stays unbroken, we can clearly assume it. It may move to the upper downtrend line in few days. 

Target date is around June 15th. As you can see, there is always 50 days between each high. 

Let's see if this pattern plays out again ! If so, there is a nice 20% to make ! :) 

BUY : 150 - 160 
SELL : 200 - 220 
STOP : 145 

Feel free to comment and follow.  

Cheers,

Monero is a great privacy coin with around 2X - 10X possibility this year  

We are leaning more towards 8X - 10X however due to numerous privacy coins entering larger market, we might see slower price growth  

In all this is a great investment for long term

On this occasion we are looking for an entry in the XMR and USD parity to open a long position that takes us to a price of around 152 USD.  

We have to be aware of the confirmation of buying signal that is currently developing.  

Buy strategy: 
1) The price (candle) closed above the Kijun (pink line) is a well-known strategy using  Ichimoku . 
2) But, we prefer a confirmation, then we wait for Tenkan (blue line) crossing Kijun (pink line). 

MACD+DI also can provide us further confirmation of the signal (green points). 
The  RSI  is currently above 50. It is an indication of a  bullish  market.  

Our target is 152 USD. And our Stop Loss, 113 USD. The SL is determined by the support offered by the lower line of the Kumo (cloud).  

Stay tuned of any changes and good luck!

					XMR could not stand the rise of BTC. As a result, XMR lost its bullish trend in time frames shorter than 1 hour. 

You can use the RSI as a trend reversal indicator and should expect a rebound from the 45 - 50 levels. The RSI should be kept in the upward half of the chart to validate a bearish reversal. If the latter does not occur, consider selling according to your risk level.

I tried to make a good reflection of the whole cryptomarket. I only could do this with coins that been trading for more than a year. Otherwise the chart did not work. So I made a chart with the following coins: 
BTC             , ETH, XRP, LTC, DASH, NEO, MONERO,  XEM             

If people also wanna chart on this chart use the following ticker: 
COINBASE:BTCUSD*16692550+BITFINEX:ETHUSD*92862174+BITTREX:XRPUSD*38622892459+BITFINEX:LTCUSD*53927233+BITTREX:DASHUSD*7701656+BITTREX:NEOUSD*65000000+BITTREX:XMRUSD*15377976+BITTREX:XEMUSD*8999999999 

About the charts 
The first chart you see is on the logic alghoritme. The second one in normal view. 

On the first alghoritme we see a big rising wedge! On the second one you see the beautifull elliot-wave pattern. The 5th wave or 3th wave up reached the 1.618 fibonacci level, the same level als the last crash.  

I think there could be an abc-correction wave. With a total retracement of the whole cryptocurrancy market of 35-55%. 

Some other information to think about. Correct me when i'm wrong! 
First crash:  
-20 june the total marketcap of cryptocurrancies was 115 million.  
-16 july the total marketcap of cryptocurrancies 67 million  

Trigger: The first  bitcoin              fork?  

Second crash:  
-1 september the total marketcap of cryptocurrancies was 174 million.  
-15 september the total marketcap of cryptocurrancies was 109 million.  

Trigger: China Ban?  

The last and upcomming crash>  
It should be time for a correction of the total market! I think there is a huge change.  

Trigger: I really think the Tether usd hack could trigger a crash.  

Last thing I want to say, I try to do an objective view. I believe it will happen. You don't have to agree with me, take your own conclusion!

The bitcoin dominance is 56%. So the total marketcap of the other coins should be 44%. 

Total marketcap: 54.000.000.000 / 44% = 122.727.000.000 usd 
Bitcoin: 122.727.000.000 - 54.000.000.000 = 68.727.000.000 usd 

So the bitcoin should multiplied by 68.727.000.000 / 138.000.000.000 = 50%

Hello guys, 

XMR has reached it's bottom and if 150USD stays unbroken, we can clearly assume it. It may move to the upper downtrend line in few days. 

Target date is around June 15th. As you can see, there is always 50 days between each high. 

Let's see if this pattern plays out again ! If so, there is a nice 20% to make ! :) 

BUY : 150 - 160 
SELL : 200 - 220 
STOP : 145 

Feel free to comment and follow.  

Cheers,

Monero is a great privacy coin with around 2X - 10X possibility this year  

We are leaning more towards 8X - 10X however due to numerous privacy coins entering larger market, we might see slower price growth  

In all this is a great investment for long term

On this occasion we are looking for an entry in the XMR and USD parity to open a long position that takes us to a price of around 152 USD.  

We have to be aware of the confirmation of buying signal that is currently developing.  

Buy strategy: 
1) The price (candle) closed above the Kijun (pink line) is a well-known strategy using  Ichimoku . 
2) But, we prefer a confirmation, then we wait for Tenkan (blue line) crossing Kijun (pink line). 

MACD+DI also can provide us further confirmation of the signal (green points). 
The  RSI  is currently above 50. It is an indication of a  bullish  market.  

Our target is 152 USD. And our Stop Loss, 113 USD. The SL is determined by the support offered by the lower line of the Kumo (cloud).  

Stay tuned of any changes and good luck!

You can use the RSI as a trend reversal indicator and should expect a rebound from the 45 - 50 levels. The RSI should be kept in the upward half of the chart to validate a bearish reversal. If the latter does not occur, consider selling according to your risk level.

One version of the story has the emperor going bankrupt as the 63 doublings ultimately totaled 18 million trillion grains of rice. At ten grains of rice per square inch, this requires rice fields covering twice the surface area of the Earth, oceans included. Another version of the story has the inventor losing his head.

					Quoted for possible truth:  

""It's not about HW wallets or anything, XMR is being price suppressed because big players are accumulating it big time. As someone said smart money is well aware of monero and they want to keep it as much as they can for themselves until inflation is low and they can mark the price way up 

Didn't you guys notice we always are the last to pump ? its because pump happen in hierarchical orders, first you get the shittest of the the shitcoins with the wierd names like GROESTLECOIN and so on, then you got noob coins and strange coins and semi good coins, and when smart money has taken dumb money for as much as they can they pump XMR because they need to store their accumulated wealth somewhere, and whats the better place than monero? 

Next year, we'll be at 4% inflation, this is bitcoin level now, and then quickly we'll be under bitcoin yearly inflation... this will be the time to mark up the price BIG TIME, I'm talking BTC current level 

This is a slow play, this is like poker when you got quad aces and you want to take as much as you can from the noobs, you take your time, you let dumb money bids and buy DRAGONCHAIN and then you put your profit back into XMR.  

RINSE and REPEAT until we're at 2-3% inflation and price is above 10K and doesn't come back. ""

This is my idea for Monero. In my eyes XMR is the leader when it comes to private crypto transactions. However, 
I am not sure how big of an impact regulations will have on privacy coins. This idea is just based on previous chart patterns without considering fundamentals.

The first chart you see is on the logic alghoritme. The second one in normal view. 

On the first alghoritme we see a big rising wedge! On the second one you see the beautifull elliot-wave pattern. The 5th wave or 3th wave up reached the 1.618 fibonacci level, the same level als the last crash.  

I think there could be an abc-correction wave. With a total retracement of the whole cryptocurrancy market of 35-55%. 

Some other information to think about. Correct me when i'm wrong! 
First crash:  
-20 june the total marketcap of cryptocurrancies was 115 million.  
-16 july the total marketcap of cryptocurrancies 67 million  

Trigger: The first  bitcoin -1.53%  fork?  

Second crash:  
-1 september the total marketcap of cryptocurrancies was 174 million.  
-15 september the total marketcap of cryptocurrancies was 109 million.  

Trigger: China Ban?

It should be time for a correction of the total market! I think there is a huge change.

The bitcoin dominance is 56%. So the total marketcap of the other coins should be 44%. 

Total marketcap: 54.000.000.000 / 44% = 122.727.000.000 usd 
Bitcoin: 122.727.000.000 - 54.000.000.000 = 68.727.000.000 usd 

So the bitcoin should multiplied by 68.727.000.000 / 138.000.000.000 = 50%

Hello guys, 

XMR has reached it's bottom and if 150USD stays unbroken, we can clearly assume it. It may move to the upper downtrend line in few days. 

Target date is around June 15th. As you can see, there is always 50 days between each high. 

Let's see if this pattern plays out again ! If so, there is a nice 20% to make ! :) 

BUY : 150 - 160 
SELL : 200 - 220 
STOP : 145 

Feel free to comment and follow.  

Cheers,

Monero is a great privacy coin with around 2X - 10X possibility this year  

We are leaning more towards 8X - 10X however due to numerous privacy coins entering larger market, we might see slower price growth  

In all this is a great investment for long term

On this occasion we are looking for an entry in the XMR and USD parity to open a long position that takes us to a price of around 152 USD.  

We have to be aware of the confirmation of buying signal that is currently developing.  

Buy strategy: 
1) The price (candle) closed above the Kijun (pink line) is a well-known strategy using  Ichimoku . 
2) But, we prefer a confirmation, then we wait for Tenkan (blue line) crossing Kijun (pink line). 

MACD+DI also can provide us further confirmation of the signal (green points). 
The  RSI  is currently above 50. It is an indication of a  bullish  market.  

Our target is 152 USD. And our Stop Loss, 113 USD. The SL is determined by the support offered by the lower line of the Kumo (cloud).  

Stay tuned of any changes and good luck!

You can use the RSI as a trend reversal indicator and should expect a rebound from the 45 - 50 levels. The RSI should be kept in the upward half of the chart to validate a bearish reversal. If the latter does not occur, consider selling according to your risk level.

In response to the emperor’s offer of a reward for his new beloved game, the inventor asked for a single grain of rice on the first square, two on the second square, four on the third, and so on. The Emperor quickly granted this seemingly benign and humble request. 

One version of the story has the emperor going bankrupt as the 63 doublings ultimately totaled 18 million trillion grains of rice. At ten grains of rice per square inch, this requires rice fields covering twice the surface area of the Earth, oceans included. Another version of the story has the inventor losing his head.

Comment:
					Quoted for possible truth:  

""It's not about HW wallets or anything, XMR is being price suppressed because big players are accumulating it big time. As someone said smart money is well aware of monero and they want to keep it as much as they can for themselves until inflation is low and they can mark the price way up 

Didn't you guys notice we always are the last to pump ? its because pump happen in hierarchical orders, first you get the shittest of the the shitcoins with the wierd names like GROESTLECOIN and so on, then you got noob coins and strange coins and semi good coins, and when smart money has taken dumb money for as much as they can they pump XMR because they need to store their accumulated wealth somewhere, and whats the better place than monero? 

Next year, we'll be at 4% inflation, this is bitcoin level now, and then quickly we'll be under bitcoin yearly inflation... this will be the time to mark up the price BIG TIME, I'm talking BTC current level 

This is a slow play, this is like poker when you got quad aces and you want to take as much as you can from the noobs, you take your time, you let dumb money bids and buy DRAGONCHAIN and then you put your profit back into XMR.  

RINSE and REPEAT until we're at 2-3% inflation and price is above 10K and doesn't come back. ""

This is my idea for Monero. In my eyes XMR is the leader when it comes to private crypto transactions. However, 
I am not sure how big of an impact regulations will have on privacy coins. This idea is just based on previous chart patterns without considering fundamentals.

I tried to make a good reflection of the whole cryptomarket. I only could do this with coins that been trading for more than a year. Otherwise the chart did not work. So I made a chart with the following coins: 
BTC -1.52% , ETH, XRP, LTC, DASH, NEO, MONERO,  XEM             

If people also wanna chart on this chart use the following ticker: 
COINBASE:BTCUSD*16692550+BITFINEX:ETHUSD*92862174+BITTREX:XRPUSD*38622892459+BITFINEX:LTCUSD*53927233+BITTREX:DASHUSD*7701656+BITTREX:NEOUSD*65000000+BITTREX:XMRUSD*15377976+BITTREX:XEMUSD*8999999999 

About the charts 
The first chart you see is on the logic alghoritme. The second one in normal view. 

On the first alghoritme we see a big rising wedge! On the second one you see the beautifull elliot-wave pattern. The 5th wave or 3th wave up reached the 1.618 fibonacci level, the same level als the last crash.  

I think there could be an abc-correction wave. With a total retracement of the whole cryptocurrancy market of 35-55%. 

Some other information to think about. Correct me when i'm wrong! 
First crash:  
-20 june the total marketcap of cryptocurrancies was 115 million.  
-16 july the total marketcap of cryptocurrancies 67 million  

Trigger: The first  bitcoin -1.52%  fork?  

Second crash:  
-1 september the total marketcap of cryptocurrancies was 174 million.  
-15 september the total marketcap of cryptocurrancies was 109 million.  

Trigger: China Ban?  

The last and upcomming crash>  
It should be time for a correction of the total market! I think there is a huge change.  

Trigger: I really think the Tether usd hack could trigger a crash.  

Last thing I want to say, I try to do an objective view. I believe it will happen. You don't have to agree with me, take your own conclusion!

Total marketcap: 54.000.000.000 / 44% = 122.727.000.000 usd 
Bitcoin: 122.727.000.000 - 54.000.000.000 = 68.727.000.000 usd 

So the bitcoin should multiplied by 68.727.000.000 / 138.000.000.000 = 50%

XMR has reached it's bottom and if 150USD stays unbroken, we can clearly assume it. It may move to the upper downtrend line in few days. 

Target date is around June 15th. As you can see, there is always 50 days between each high. 

Let's see if this pattern plays out again ! If so, there is a nice 20% to make ! :) 

BUY : 150 - 160 
SELL : 200 - 220 
STOP : 145 

Feel free to comment and follow.  

Cheers,

					On a smaller timeframe (1H) we have several bullish signs :  
- XMR is evolving in an upward channel 
- A MACD bouncing on the 0 line, about to cross. 
- Ascending RSI that crossed the 50 line 
- EMA 10 (fast) above EMA 70 (slow) 
- EMA 70 (short term) crossing with EMA200 (long term) : potential reversal

Monero is a great privacy coin with around 2X - 10X possibility this year  

We are leaning more towards 8X - 10X however due to numerous privacy coins entering larger market, we might see slower price growth  

In all this is a great investment for long term  

Enjoy this trade my Crypto Maniacs, but remember to invest only what you can afford to lose or you're going right back to poverty on drop. We are not your financial advisors.

On this occasion we are looking for an entry in the XMR and USD parity to open a long position that takes us to a price of around 152 USD.  

We have to be aware of the confirmation of buying signal that is currently developing.  

Buy strategy: 
1) The price (candle) closed above the Kijun (pink line) is a well-known strategy using  Ichimoku . 
2) But, we prefer a confirmation, then we wait for Tenkan (blue line) crossing Kijun (pink line). 

MACD+DI also can provide us further confirmation of the signal (green points). 
The  RSI  is currently above 50. It is an indication of a  bullish  market.  

Our target is 152 USD. And our Stop Loss, 113 USD. The SL is determined by the support offered by the lower line of the Kumo (cloud).  

Stay tuned of any changes and good luck!

You can use the RSI as a trend reversal indicator and should expect a rebound from the 45 - 50 levels. The RSI should be kept in the upward half of the chart to validate a bearish reversal. If the latter does not occur, consider selling according to your risk level.

One version of the story has the emperor going bankrupt as the 63 doublings ultimately totaled 18 million trillion grains of rice. At ten grains of rice per square inch, this requires rice fields covering twice the surface area of the Earth, oceans included. Another version of the story has the inventor losing his head.

Comment:
					Quoted for possible truth:  

""It's not about HW wallets or anything, XMR is being price suppressed because big players are accumulating it big time. As someone said smart money is well aware of monero and they want to keep it as much as they can for themselves until inflation is low and they can mark the price way up 

Didn't you guys notice we always are the last to pump ? its because pump happen in hierarchical orders, first you get the shittest of the the shitcoins with the wierd names like GROESTLECOIN and so on, then you got noob coins and strange coins and semi good coins, and when smart money has taken dumb money for as much as they can they pump XMR because they need to store their accumulated wealth somewhere, and whats the better place than monero? 

Next year, we'll be at 4% inflation, this is bitcoin level now, and then quickly we'll be under bitcoin yearly inflation... this will be the time to mark up the price BIG TIME, I'm talking BTC current level 

This is a slow play, this is like poker when you got quad aces and you want to take as much as you can from the noobs, you take your time, you let dumb money bids and buy DRAGONCHAIN and then you put your profit back into XMR.  

RINSE and REPEAT until we're at 2-3% inflation and price is above 10K and doesn't come back. ""

This is my idea for Monero. In my eyes XMR is the leader when it comes to private crypto transactions. However, 
I am not sure how big of an impact regulations will have on privacy coins. This idea is just based on previous chart patterns without considering fundamentals.

I tried to make a good reflection of the whole cryptomarket. I only could do this with coins that been trading for more than a year. Otherwise the chart did not work. So I made a chart with the following coins: 
BTC -1.52% , ETH, XRP, LTC, DASH, NEO, MONERO,  XEM -1.35% 

If people also wanna chart on this chart use the following ticker: 
COINBASE:BTCUSD*16692550+BITFINEX:ETHUSD*92862174+BITTREX:XRPUSD*38622892459+BITFINEX:LTCUSD*53927233+BITTREX:DASHUSD*7701656+BITTREX:NEOUSD*65000000+BITTREX:XMRUSD*15377976+BITTREX:XEMUSD*8999999999 

About the charts 
The first chart you see is on the logic alghoritme. The second one in normal view. 

On the first alghoritme we see a big rising wedge! On the second one you see the beautifull elliot-wave pattern. The 5th wave or 3th wave up reached the 1.618 fibonacci level, the same level als the last crash.  

I think there could be an abc-correction wave. With a total retracement of the whole cryptocurrancy market of 35-55%. 

Some other information to think about. Correct me when i'm wrong! 
First crash:  
-20 june the total marketcap of cryptocurrancies was 115 million.  
-16 july the total marketcap of cryptocurrancies 67 million  

Trigger: The first  bitcoin -1.52%  fork?  

Second crash:  
-1 september the total marketcap of cryptocurrancies was 174 million.  
-15 september the total marketcap of cryptocurrancies was 109 million.  

Trigger: China Ban?  

The last and upcomming crash>  
It should be time for a correction of the total market! I think there is a huge change.  

Trigger: I really think the Tether usd hack could trigger a crash.  

Last thing I want to say, I try to do an objective view. I believe it will happen. You don't have to agree with me, take your own conclusion!

The bitcoin dominance is 56%. So the total marketcap of the other coins should be 44%. 

Total marketcap: 54.000.000.000 / 44% = 122.727.000.000 usd 
Bitcoin: 122.727.000.000 - 54.000.000.000 = 68.727.000.000 usd

Hello guys, 

XMR has reached it's bottom and if 150USD stays unbroken, we can clearly assume it. It may move to the upper downtrend line in few days. 

Target date is around June 15th. As you can see, there is always 50 days between each high. 

Let's see if this pattern plays out again ! If so, there is a nice 20% to make ! :)

On this occasion we are looking for an entry in the XMR and USD parity to open a long position that takes us to a price of around 152 USD.  

We have to be aware of the confirmation of buying signal that is currently developing.  

Buy strategy: 
1) The price (candle) closed above the Kijun (pink line) is a well-known strategy using  Ichimoku . 
2) But, we prefer a confirmation, then we wait for Tenkan (blue line) crossing Kijun (pink line). 

MACD+DI also can provide us further confirmation of the signal (green points). 
The  RSI  is currently above 50. It is an indication of a  bullish  market.  

Our target is 152 USD. And our Stop Loss, 113 USD. The SL is determined by the support offered by the lower line of the Kumo (cloud).  

Stay tuned of any changes and good luck!

You can use the RSI as a trend reversal indicator and should expect a rebound from the 45 - 50 levels. The RSI should be kept in the upward half of the chart to validate a bearish reversal. If the latter does not occur, consider selling according to your risk level.

One version of the story has the emperor going bankrupt as the 63 doublings ultimately totaled 18 million trillion grains of rice. At ten grains of rice per square inch, this requires rice fields covering twice the surface area of the Earth, oceans included. Another version of the story has the inventor losing his head.

Comment:
					Quoted for possible truth:  

""It's not about HW wallets or anything, XMR is being price suppressed because big players are accumulating it big time. As someone said smart money is well aware of monero and they want to keep it as much as they can for themselves until inflation is low and they can mark the price way up 

Didn't you guys notice we always are the last to pump ? its because pump happen in hierarchical orders, first you get the shittest of the the shitcoins with the wierd names like GROESTLECOIN and so on, then you got noob coins and strange coins and semi good coins, and when smart money has taken dumb money for as much as they can they pump XMR because they need to store their accumulated wealth somewhere, and whats the better place than monero? 

Next year, we'll be at 4% inflation, this is bitcoin level now, and then quickly we'll be under bitcoin yearly inflation... this will be the time to mark up the price BIG TIME, I'm talking BTC current level 

This is a slow play, this is like poker when you got quad aces and you want to take as much as you can from the noobs, you take your time, you let dumb money bids and buy DRAGONCHAIN and then you put your profit back into XMR.  

RINSE and REPEAT until we're at 2-3% inflation and price is above 10K and doesn't come back. ""

This is my idea for Monero. In my eyes XMR is the leader when it comes to private crypto transactions. However, 
I am not sure how big of an impact regulations will have on privacy coins. This idea is just based on previous chart patterns without considering fundamentals.

I tried to make a good reflection of the whole cryptomarket. I only could do this with coins that been trading for more than a year. Otherwise the chart did not work. So I made a chart with the following coins: 
BTC             , ETH, XRP, LTC, DASH, NEO, MONERO,  XEM             

If people also wanna chart on this chart use the following ticker: 
COINBASE:BTCUSD*16692550+BITFINEX:ETHUSD*92862174+BITTREX:XRPUSD*38622892459+BITFINEX:LTCUSD*53927233+BITTREX:DASHUSD*7701656+BITTREX:NEOUSD*65000000+BITTREX:XMRUSD*15377976+BITTREX:XEMUSD*8999999999 

About the charts 
The first chart you see is on the logic alghoritme. The second one in normal view. 

On the first alghoritme we see a big rising wedge! On the second one you see the beautifull elliot-wave pattern. The 5th wave or 3th wave up reached the 1.618 fibonacci level, the same level als the last crash.  

I think there could be an abc-correction wave. With a total retracement of the whole cryptocurrancy market of 35-55%. 

Some other information to think about. Correct me when i'm wrong! 
First crash:  
-20 june the total marketcap of cryptocurrancies was 115 million.  
-16 july the total marketcap of cryptocurrancies 67 million  

Trigger: The first  bitcoin              fork?  

Second crash:  
-1 september the total marketcap of cryptocurrancies was 174 million.  
-15 september the total marketcap of cryptocurrancies was 109 million.  

Trigger: China Ban?  

The last and upcomming crash>  
It should be time for a correction of the total market! I think there is a huge change.  

Trigger: I really think the Tether usd hack could trigger a crash.  

Last thing I want to say, I try to do an objective view. I believe it will happen. You don't have to agree with me, take your own conclusion!

The bitcoin dominance is 56%. So the total marketcap of the other coins should be 44%. 

Total marketcap: 54.000.000.000 / 44% = 122.727.000.000 usd 
Bitcoin: 122.727.000.000 - 54.000.000.000 = 68.727.000.000 usd 

So the bitcoin should multiplied by 68.727.000.000 / 138.000.000.000 = 50%

Hello guys, 

XMR has reached it's bottom and if 150USD stays unbroken, we can clearly assume it. It may move to the upper downtrend line in few days. 

Target date is around June 15th. As you can see, there is always 50 days between each high. 

Let's see if this pattern plays out again ! If so, there is a nice 20% to make ! :) 

BUY : 150 - 160 
SELL : 200 - 220 
STOP : 145 

Feel free to comment and follow.  

Cheers,

					Quoted for possible truth:  

""It's not about HW wallets or anything, XMR is being price suppressed because big players are accumulating it big time. As someone said smart money is well aware of monero and they want to keep it as much as they can for themselves until inflation is low and they can mark the price way up 

Didn't you guys notice we always are the last to pump ? its because pump happen in hierarchical orders, first you get the shittest of the the shitcoins with the wierd names like GROESTLECOIN and so on, then you got noob coins and strange coins and semi good coins, and when smart money has taken dumb money for as much as they can they pump XMR because they need to store their accumulated wealth somewhere, and whats the better place than monero? 

Next year, we'll be at 4% inflation, this is bitcoin level now, and then quickly we'll be under bitcoin yearly inflation... this will be the time to mark up the price BIG TIME, I'm talking BTC current level 

This is a slow play, this is like poker when you got quad aces and you want to take as much as you can from the noobs, you take your time, you let dumb money bids and buy DRAGONCHAIN and then you put your profit back into XMR.  

RINSE and REPEAT until we're at 2-3% inflation and price is above 10K and doesn't come back. ""

This is my idea for Monero. In my eyes XMR is the leader when it comes to private crypto transactions. However, 
I am not sure how big of an impact regulations will have on privacy coins. This idea is just based on previous chart patterns without considering fundamentals.

Nov 21, 2017




I tried to make a good reflection of the whole cryptomarket. I only could do this with coins that been trading for more than a year. Otherwise the chart did not work. So I made a chart with the following coins: 
BTC -1.52% , ETH, XRP, LTC, DASH, NEO, MONERO,  XEM -1.35% 

If people also wanna chart on this chart use the following ticker: 
COINBASE:BTCUSD*16692550+BITFINEX:ETHUSD*92862174+BITTREX:XRPUSD*38622892459+BITFINEX:LTCUSD*53927233+BITTREX:DASHUSD*7701656+BITTREX:NEOUSD*65000000+BITTREX:XMRUSD*15377976+BITTREX:XEMUSD*8999999999 

About the charts 
The first chart you see is on the logic alghoritme. The second one in normal view. 

On the first alghoritme we see a big rising wedge! On the second one you see the beautifull elliot-wave pattern. The 5th wave or 3th wave up reached the 1.618 fibonacci level, the same level als the last crash.  

I think there could be an abc-correction wave. With a total retracement of the whole cryptocurrancy market of 35-55%. 

Some other information to think about. Correct me when i'm wrong! 
First crash:  
-20 june the total marketcap of cryptocurrancies was 115 million.  
-16 july the total marketcap of cryptocurrancies 67 million  

Trigger: The first  bitcoin -1.52%  fork?  

Second crash:  
-1 september the total marketcap of cryptocurrancies was 174 million.  
-15 september the total marketcap of cryptocurrancies was 109 million.  

Trigger: China Ban?  

The last and upcomming crash>  
It should be time for a correction of the total market! I think there is a huge change.  

Trigger: I really think the Tether usd hack could trigger a crash.  

Last thing I want to say, I try to do an objective view. I believe it will happen. You don't have to agree with me, take your own conclusion!

The bitcoin dominance is 56%. So the total marketcap of the other coins should be 44%. 

Total marketcap: 54.000.000.000 / 44% = 122.727.000.000 usd 
Bitcoin: 122.727.000.000 - 54.000.000.000 = 68.727.000.000 usd 

So the bitcoin should multiplied by 68.727.000.000 / 138.000.000.000 = 50%

Hello guys, 

XMR has reached it's bottom and if 150USD stays unbroken, we can clearly assume it. It may move to the upper downtrend line in few days. 

Target date is around June 15th. As you can see, there is always 50 days between each high. 

Let's see if this pattern plays out again ! If so, there is a nice 20% to make ! :) 

BUY : 150 - 160 
SELL : 200 - 220 
STOP : 145 

Feel free to comment and follow.  

Cheers,

Monero is a great privacy coin with around 2X - 10X possibility this year  

We are leaning more towards 8X - 10X however due to numerous privacy coins entering larger market, we might see slower price growth  

In all this is a great investment for long term

On this occasion we are looking for an entry in the XMR and USD parity to open a long position that takes us to a price of around 152 USD.  

We have to be aware of the confirmation of buying signal that is currently developing.  

Buy strategy: 
1) The price (candle) closed above the Kijun (pink line) is a well-known strategy using  Ichimoku . 
2) But, we prefer a confirmation, then we wait for Tenkan (blue line) crossing Kijun (pink line). 

MACD+DI also can provide us further confirmation of the signal (green points). 
The  RSI  is currently above 50. It is an indication of a  bullish  market.  

Our target is 152 USD. And our Stop Loss, 113 USD. The SL is determined by the support offered by the lower line of the Kumo (cloud).  

Stay tuned of any changes and good luck!

You can use the RSI as a trend reversal indicator and should expect a rebound from the 45 - 50 levels. The RSI should be kept in the upward half of the chart to validate a bearish reversal. If the latter does not occur, consider selling according to your risk level.

Next year, we'll be at 4% inflation, this is bitcoin level now, and then quickly we'll be under bitcoin yearly inflation... this will be the time to mark up the price BIG TIME, I'm talking BTC current level 

This is a slow play, this is like poker when you got quad aces and you want to take as much as you can from the noobs, you take your time, you let dumb money bids and buy DRAGONCHAIN and then you put your profit back into XMR.  

RINSE and REPEAT until we're at 2-3% inflation and price is above 10K and doesn't come back. ""

This is my idea for Monero. In my eyes XMR is the leader when it comes to private crypto transactions. However, 
I am not sure how big of an impact regulations will have on privacy coins. This idea is just based on previous chart patterns without considering fundamentals.

Nov 21, 2017




I tried to make a good reflection of the whole cryptomarket. I only could do this with coins that been trading for more than a year. Otherwise the chart did not work. So I made a chart with the following coins: 
BTC             , ETH, XRP, LTC, DASH, NEO, MONERO,  XEM             

If people also wanna chart on this chart use the following ticker: 
COINBASE:BTCUSD*16692550+BITFINEX:ETHUSD*92862174+BITTREX:XRPUSD*38622892459+BITFINEX:LTCUSD*53927233+BITTREX:DASHUSD*7701656+BITTREX:NEOUSD*65000000+BITTREX:XMRUSD*15377976+BITTREX:XEMUSD*8999999999 

About the charts 
The first chart you see is on the logic alghoritme. The second one in normal view. 

On the first alghoritme we see a big rising wedge! On the second one you see the beautifull elliot-wave pattern. The 5th wave or 3th wave up reached the 1.618 fibonacci level, the same level als the last crash.  

I think there could be an abc-correction wave. With a total retracement of the whole cryptocurrancy market of 35-55%. 

Some other information to think about. Correct me when i'm wrong! 
First crash:  
-20 june the total marketcap of cryptocurrancies was 115 million.  
-16 july the total marketcap of cryptocurrancies 67 million  

Trigger: The first  bitcoin              fork?  

Second crash:  
-1 september the total marketcap of cryptocurrancies was 174 million.  
-15 september the total marketcap of cryptocurrancies was 109 million.  

Trigger: China Ban?  

The last and upcomming crash>  
It should be time for a correction of the total market! I think there is a huge change.  

Trigger: I really think the Tether usd hack could trigger a crash.  

Last thing I want to say, I try to do an objective view. I believe it will happen. You don't have to agree with me, take your own conclusion!

The bitcoin dominance is 56%. So the total marketcap of the other coins should be 44%. 

Total marketcap: 54.000.000.000 / 44% = 122.727.000.000 usd 
Bitcoin: 122.727.000.000 - 54.000.000.000 = 68.727.000.000 usd 

So the bitcoin should multiplied by 68.727.000.000 / 138.000.000.000 = 50%

Hello guys, 

XMR has reached it's bottom and if 150USD stays unbroken, we can clearly assume it. It may move to the upper downtrend line in few days. 

Target date is around June 15th. As you can see, there is always 50 days between each high. 

Let's see if this pattern plays out again ! If so, there is a nice 20% to make ! :) 

BUY : 150 - 160 
SELL : 200 - 220 
STOP : 145 

Feel free to comment and follow.  

Cheers,

Monero is a great privacy coin with around 2X - 10X possibility this year  

We are leaning more towards 8X - 10X however due to numerous privacy coins entering larger market, we might see slower price growth  

In all this is a great investment for long term

On this occasion we are looking for an entry in the XMR and USD parity to open a long position that takes us to a price of around 152 USD.  

We have to be aware of the confirmation of buying signal that is currently developing.  

Buy strategy: 
1) The price (candle) closed above the Kijun (pink line) is a well-known strategy using  Ichimoku . 
2) But, we prefer a confirmation, then we wait for Tenkan (blue line) crossing Kijun (pink line). 

MACD+DI also can provide us further confirmation of the signal (green points). 
The  RSI  is currently above 50. It is an indication of a  bullish  market.  

Our target is 152 USD. And our Stop Loss, 113 USD. The SL is determined by the support offered by the lower line of the Kumo (cloud).  

Stay tuned of any changes and good luck!

You can use the RSI as a trend reversal indicator and should expect a rebound from the 45 - 50 levels. The RSI should be kept in the upward half of the chart to validate a bearish reversal. If the latter does not occur, consider selling according to your risk level.

a minimum upside target at 395 - really the break-out came  
24 hours ago but this dip is worth staying close to today,  
looking to get long as low as possible as this cureent little

I tried to make a good reflection of the whole cryptomarket. I only could do this with coins that been trading for more than a year. Otherwise the chart did not work. So I made a chart with the following coins: 
BTC -1.62% , ETH, XRP, LTC, DASH, NEO, MONERO,  XEM             

If people also wanna chart on this chart use the following ticker: 
COINBASE:BTCUSD*16692550+BITFINEX:ETHUSD*92862174+BITTREX:XRPUSD*38622892459+BITFINEX:LTCUSD*53927233+BITTREX:DASHUSD*7701656+BITTREX:NEOUSD*65000000+BITTREX:XMRUSD*15377976+BITTREX:XEMUSD*8999999999 

About the charts 
The first chart you see is on the logic alghoritme. The second one in normal view. 

On the first alghoritme we see a big rising wedge! On the second one you see the beautifull elliot-wave pattern. The 5th wave or 3th wave up reached the 1.618 fibonacci level, the same level als the last crash.  

I think there could be an abc-correction wave. With a total retracement of the whole cryptocurrancy market of 35-55%. 

Some other information to think about. Correct me when i'm wrong! 
First crash:  
-20 june the total marketcap of cryptocurrancies was 115 million.  
-16 july the total marketcap of cryptocurrancies 67 million  

Trigger: The first  bitcoin -1.62%  fork?  

Second crash:  
-1 september the total marketcap of cryptocurrancies was 174 million.  
-15 september the total marketcap of cryptocurrancies was 109 million.  

Trigger: China Ban?  

The last and upcomming crash>  
It should be time for a correction of the total market! I think there is a huge change.  

Trigger: I really think the Tether usd hack could trigger a crash.  

Last thing I want to say, I try to do an objective view. I believe it will happen. You don't have to agree with me, take your own conclusion!

The bitcoin dominance is 56%. So the total marketcap of the other coins should be 44%. 

Total marketcap: 54.000.000.000 / 44% = 122.727.000.000 usd 
Bitcoin: 122.727.000.000 - 54.000.000.000 = 68.727.000.000 usd 

So the bitcoin should multiplied by 68.727.000.000 / 138.000.000.000 = 50%

Hello guys, 

XMR has reached it's bottom and if 150USD stays unbroken, we can clearly assume it. It may move to the upper downtrend line in few days. 

Target date is around June 15th. As you can see, there is always 50 days between each high. 

Let's see if this pattern plays out again ! If so, there is a nice 20% to make ! :) 

BUY : 150 - 160 
SELL : 200 - 220 
STOP : 145 

Feel free to comment and follow.  

Cheers,

In all this is a great investment for long term

On this occasion we are looking for an entry in the XMR and USD parity to open a long position that takes us to a price of around 152 USD.  

We have to be aware of the confirmation of buying signal that is currently developing.  

Buy strategy: 
1) The price (candle) closed above the Kijun (pink line) is a well-known strategy using  Ichimoku . 
2) But, we prefer a confirmation, then we wait for Tenkan (blue line) crossing Kijun (pink line). 

MACD+DI also can provide us further confirmation of the signal (green points). 
The  RSI  is currently above 50. It is an indication of a  bullish  market.  

Our target is 152 USD. And our Stop Loss, 113 USD. The SL is determined by the support offered by the lower line of the Kumo (cloud).  

Stay tuned of any changes and good luck!

					XMR could not stand the rise of BTC. As a result, XMR lost its bullish trend in time frames shorter than 1 hour. 

You can use the RSI as a trend reversal indicator and should expect a rebound from the 45 - 50 levels. The RSI should be kept in the upward half of the chart to validate a bearish reversal. If the latter does not occur, consider selling according to your risk level.

One version of the story has the emperor going bankrupt as the 63 doublings ultimately totaled 18 million trillion grains of rice. At ten grains of rice per square inch, this requires rice fields covering twice the surface area of the Earth, oceans included. Another version of the story has the inventor losing his head.

""It's not about HW wallets or anything, XMR is being price suppressed because big players are accumulating it big time. As someone said smart money is well aware of monero and they want to keep it as much as they can for themselves until inflation is low and they can mark the price way up 

Didn't you guys notice we always are the last to pump ? its because pump happen in hierarchical orders, first you get the shittest of the the shitcoins with the wierd names like GROESTLECOIN and so on, then you got noob coins and strange coins and semi good coins, and when smart money has taken dumb money for as much as they can they pump XMR because they need to store their accumulated wealth somewhere, and whats the better place than monero? 

Next year, we'll be at 4% inflation, this is bitcoin level now, and then quickly we'll be under bitcoin yearly inflation... this will be the time to mark up the price BIG TIME, I'm talking BTC current level 

This is a slow play, this is like poker when you got quad aces and you want to take as much as you can from the noobs, you take your time, you let dumb money bids and buy DRAGONCHAIN and then you put your profit back into XMR.  

RINSE and REPEAT until we're at 2-3% inflation and price is above 10K and doesn't come back. ""

This is my idea for Monero. In my eyes XMR is the leader when it comes to private crypto transactions. However, 
I am not sure how big of an impact regulations will have on privacy coins. This idea is just based on previous chart patterns without considering fundamentals.

The bitcoin dominance is 56%. So the total marketcap of the other coins should be 44%. 

Total marketcap: 54.000.000.000 / 44% = 122.727.000.000 usd 
Bitcoin: 122.727.000.000 - 54.000.000.000 = 68.727.000.000 usd

Hello guys, 

XMR has reached it's bottom and if 150USD stays unbroken, we can clearly assume it. It may move to the upper downtrend line in few days. 

Target date is around June 15th. As you can see, there is always 50 days between each high. 

Let's see if this pattern plays out again ! If so, there is a nice 20% to make ! :) 

BUY : 150 - 160 
SELL : 200 - 220 
STOP : 145 

Feel free to comment and follow.  

Cheers,

On this occasion we are looking for an entry in the XMR and USD parity to open a long position that takes us to a price of around 152 USD.  

We have to be aware of the confirmation of buying signal that is currently developing.  

Buy strategy: 
1) The price (candle) closed above the Kijun (pink line) is a well-known strategy using  Ichimoku . 
2) But, we prefer a confirmation, then we wait for Tenkan (blue line) crossing Kijun (pink line). 

MACD+DI also can provide us further confirmation of the signal (green points). 
The  RSI  is currently above 50. It is an indication of a  bullish  market.  

Our target is 152 USD. And our Stop Loss, 113 USD. The SL is determined by the support offered by the lower line of the Kumo (cloud).  

Stay tuned of any changes and good luck!

You can use the RSI as a trend reversal indicator and should expect a rebound from the 45 - 50 levels. The RSI should be kept in the upward half of the chart to validate a bearish reversal. If the latter does not occur, consider selling according to your risk level.

One version of the story has the emperor going bankrupt as the 63 doublings ultimately totaled 18 million trillion grains of rice. At ten grains of rice per square inch, this requires rice fields covering twice the surface area of the Earth, oceans included. Another version of the story has the inventor losing his head.

					Quoted for possible truth:  

""It's not about HW wallets or anything, XMR is being price suppressed because big players are accumulating it big time. As someone said smart money is well aware of monero and they want to keep it as much as they can for themselves until inflation is low and they can mark the price way up 

Didn't you guys notice we always are the last to pump ? its because pump happen in hierarchical orders, first you get the shittest of the the shitcoins with the wierd names like GROESTLECOIN and so on, then you got noob coins and strange coins and semi good coins, and when smart money has taken dumb money for as much as they can they pump XMR because they need to store their accumulated wealth somewhere, and whats the better place than monero? 

Next year, we'll be at 4% inflation, this is bitcoin level now, and then quickly we'll be under bitcoin yearly inflation... this will be the time to mark up the price BIG TIME, I'm talking BTC current level 

This is a slow play, this is like poker when you got quad aces and you want to take as much as you can from the noobs, you take your time, you let dumb money bids and buy DRAGONCHAIN and then you put your profit back into XMR.  

RINSE and REPEAT until we're at 2-3% inflation and price is above 10K and doesn't come back. ""

This is my idea for Monero. In my eyes XMR is the leader when it comes to private crypto transactions. However, 
I am not sure how big of an impact regulations will have on privacy coins. This idea is just based on previous chart patterns without considering fundamentals.

I tried to make a good reflection of the whole cryptomarket. I only could do this with coins that been trading for more than a year. Otherwise the chart did not work. So I made a chart with the following coins: 
BTC             , ETH, XRP, LTC, DASH, NEO, MONERO,  XEM

About the charts 
The first chart you see is on the logic alghoritme. The second one in normal view. 

On the first alghoritme we see a big rising wedge! On the second one you see the beautifull elliot-wave pattern. The 5th wave or 3th wave up reached the 1.618 fibonacci level, the same level als the last crash.  

I think there could be an abc-correction wave. With a total retracement of the whole cryptocurrancy market of 35-55%. 

Some other information to think about. Correct me when i'm wrong! 
First crash:  
-20 june the total marketcap of cryptocurrancies was 115 million.  
-16 july the total marketcap of cryptocurrancies 67 million  

Trigger: The first  bitcoin              fork?  

Second crash:  
-1 september the total marketcap of cryptocurrancies was 174 million.  
-15 september the total marketcap of cryptocurrancies was 109 million.  

Trigger: China Ban?  

The last and upcomming crash>  
It should be time for a correction of the total market! I think there is a huge change.  

Trigger: I really think the Tether usd hack could trigger a crash.  

Last thing I want to say, I try to do an objective view. I believe it will happen. You don't have to agree with me, take your own conclusion!

The bitcoin dominance is 56%. So the total marketcap of the other coins should be 44%. 

Total marketcap: 54.000.000.000 / 44% = 122.727.000.000 usd 
Bitcoin: 122.727.000.000 - 54.000.000.000 = 68.727.000.000 usd

Hello guys, 

XMR has reached it's bottom and if 150USD stays unbroken, we can clearly assume it. It may move to the upper downtrend line in few days. 

Target date is around June 15th. As you can see, there is always 50 days between each high. 

Let's see if this pattern plays out again ! If so, there is a nice 20% to make ! :)

Monero is a great privacy coin with around 2X - 10X possibility this year  

We are leaning more towards 8X - 10X however due to numerous privacy coins entering larger market, we might see slower price growth  

In all this is a great investment for long term

On this occasion we are looking for an entry in the XMR and USD parity to open a long position that takes us to a price of around 152 USD.  

We have to be aware of the confirmation of buying signal that is currently developing.  

Buy strategy: 
1) The price (candle) closed above the Kijun (pink line) is a well-known strategy using  Ichimoku . 
2) But, we prefer a confirmation, then we wait for Tenkan (blue line) crossing Kijun (pink line). 

MACD+DI also can provide us further confirmation of the signal (green points). 
The  RSI  is currently above 50. It is an indication of a  bullish  market.  

Our target is 152 USD. And our Stop Loss, 113 USD. The SL is determined by the support offered by the lower line of the Kumo (cloud).  

Stay tuned of any changes and good luck!

You can use the RSI as a trend reversal indicator and should expect a rebound from the 45 - 50 levels. The RSI should be kept in the upward half of the chart to validate a bearish reversal. If the latter does not occur, consider selling according to your risk level.

One version of the story has the emperor going bankrupt as the 63 doublings ultimately totaled 18 million trillion grains of rice. At ten grains of rice per square inch, this requires rice fields covering twice the surface area of the Earth, oceans included. Another version of the story has the inventor losing his head.

					Quoted for possible truth:  

""It's not about HW wallets or anything, XMR is being price suppressed because big players are accumulating it big time. As someone said smart money is well aware of monero and they want to keep it as much as they can for themselves until inflation is low and they can mark the price way up 

Didn't you guys notice we always are the last to pump ? its because pump happen in hierarchical orders, first you get the shittest of the the shitcoins with the wierd names like GROESTLECOIN and so on, then you got noob coins and strange coins and semi good coins, and when smart money has taken dumb money for as much as they can they pump XMR because they need to store their accumulated wealth somewhere, and whats the better place than monero? 

Next year, we'll be at 4% inflation, this is bitcoin level now, and then quickly we'll be under bitcoin yearly inflation... this will be the time to mark up the price BIG TIME, I'm talking BTC current level 

This is a slow play, this is like poker when you got quad aces and you want to take as much as you can from the noobs, you take your time, you let dumb money bids and buy DRAGONCHAIN and then you put your profit back into XMR.  

RINSE and REPEAT until we're at 2-3% inflation and price is above 10K and doesn't come back. ""

This is my idea for Monero. In my eyes XMR is the leader when it comes to private crypto transactions. However, 
I am not sure how big of an impact regulations will have on privacy coins. This idea is just based on previous chart patterns without considering fundamentals.

I tried to make a good reflection of the whole cryptomarket. I only could do this with coins that been trading for more than a year. Otherwise the chart did not work. So I made a chart with the following coins: 
BTC             , ETH, XRP, LTC, DASH, NEO, MONERO,  XEM             

If people also wanna chart on this chart use the following ticker: 
COINBASE:BTCUSD*16692550+BITFINEX:ETHUSD*92862174+BITTREX:XRPUSD*38622892459+BITFINEX:LTCUSD*53927233+BITTREX:DASHUSD*7701656+BITTREX:NEOUSD*65000000+BITTREX:XMRUSD*15377976+BITTREX:XEMUSD*8999999999 

About the charts 
The first chart you see is on the logic alghoritme. The second one in normal view. 

On the first alghoritme we see a big rising wedge! On the second one you see the beautifull elliot-wave pattern. The 5th wave or 3th wave up reached the 1.618 fibonacci level, the same level als the last crash.  

I think there could be an abc-correction wave. With a total retracement of the whole cryptocurrancy market of 35-55%. 

Some other information to think about. Correct me when i'm wrong! 
First crash:  
-20 june the total marketcap of cryptocurrancies was 115 million.  
-16 july the total marketcap of cryptocurrancies 67 million  

Trigger: The first  bitcoin              fork?  

Second crash:  
-1 september the total marketcap of cryptocurrancies was 174 million.  
-15 september the total marketcap of cryptocurrancies was 109 million.  

Trigger: China Ban?  

The last and upcomming crash>  
It should be time for a correction of the total market! I think there is a huge change.  

Trigger: I really think the Tether usd hack could trigger a crash.  

Last thing I want to say, I try to do an objective view. I believe it will happen. You don't have to agree with me, take your own conclusion!

Total marketcap: 54.000.000.000 / 44% = 122.727.000.000 usd 
Bitcoin: 122.727.000.000 - 54.000.000.000 = 68.727.000.000 usd

Hello guys, 

XMR has reached it's bottom and if 150USD stays unbroken, we can clearly assume it. It may move to the upper downtrend line in few days. 

Target date is around June 15th. As you can see, there is always 50 days between each high. 

Let's see if this pattern plays out again ! If so, there is a nice 20% to make ! :) 

BUY : 150 - 160 
SELL : 200 - 220 
STOP : 145

We have to be aware of the confirmation of buying signal that is currently developing.  

Buy strategy: 
1) The price (candle) closed above the Kijun (pink line) is a well-known strategy using  Ichimoku . 
2) But, we prefer a confirmation, then we wait for Tenkan (blue line) crossing Kijun (pink line). 

MACD+DI also can provide us further confirmation of the signal (green points). 
The  RSI  is currently above 50. It is an indication of a  bullish  market.  

Our target is 152 USD. And our Stop Loss, 113 USD. The SL is determined by the support offered by the lower line of the Kumo (cloud).  

Stay tuned of any changes and good luck!

Comment:
					XMR could not stand the rise of BTC. As a result, XMR lost its bullish trend in time frames shorter than 1 hour. 

You can use the RSI as a trend reversal indicator and should expect a rebound from the 45 - 50 levels. The RSI should be kept in the upward half of the chart to validate a bearish reversal. If the latter does not occur, consider selling according to your risk level.

One version of the story has the emperor going bankrupt as the 63 doublings ultimately totaled 18 million trillion grains of rice. At ten grains of rice per square inch, this requires rice fields covering twice the surface area of the Earth, oceans included. Another version of the story has the inventor losing his head.

Comment:
					Quoted for possible truth:  

""It's not about HW wallets or anything, XMR is being price suppressed because big players are accumulating it big time. As someone said smart money is well aware of monero and they want to keep it as much as they can for themselves until inflation is low and they can mark the price way up 

Didn't you guys notice we always are the last to pump ? its because pump happen in hierarchical orders, first you get the shittest of the the shitcoins with the wierd names like GROESTLECOIN and so on, then you got noob coins and strange coins and semi good coins, and when smart money has taken dumb money for as much as they can they pump XMR because they need to store their accumulated wealth somewhere, and whats the better place than monero? 

Next year, we'll be at 4% inflation, this is bitcoin level now, and then quickly we'll be under bitcoin yearly inflation... this will be the time to mark up the price BIG TIME, I'm talking BTC current level 

This is a slow play, this is like poker when you got quad aces and you want to take as much as you can from the noobs, you take your time, you let dumb money bids and buy DRAGONCHAIN and then you put your profit back into XMR.  

RINSE and REPEAT until we're at 2-3% inflation and price is above 10K and doesn't come back. ""

This is my idea for Monero. In my eyes XMR is the leader when it comes to private crypto transactions. However, 
I am not sure how big of an impact regulations will have on privacy coins. This idea is just based on previous chart patterns without considering fundamentals.

Nov 21, 2017




I tried to make a good reflection of the whole cryptomarket. I only could do this with coins that been trading for more than a year. Otherwise the chart did not work. So I made a chart with the following coins: 
BTC -1.61% , ETH, XRP, LTC, DASH, NEO, MONERO,  XEM -1.35% 

If people also wanna chart on this chart use the following ticker: 
COINBASE:BTCUSD*16692550+BITFINEX:ETHUSD*92862174+BITTREX:XRPUSD*38622892459+BITFINEX:LTCUSD*53927233+BITTREX:DASHUSD*7701656+BITTREX:NEOUSD*65000000+BITTREX:XMRUSD*15377976+BITTREX:XEMUSD*8999999999 

About the charts 
The first chart you see is on the logic alghoritme. The second one in normal view. 

On the first alghoritme we see a big rising wedge! On the second one you see the beautifull elliot-wave pattern. The 5th wave or 3th wave up reached the 1.618 fibonacci level, the same level als the last crash.  

I think there could be an abc-correction wave. With a total retracement of the whole cryptocurrancy market of 35-55%. 

Some other information to think about. Correct me when i'm wrong! 
First crash:  
-20 june the total marketcap of cryptocurrancies was 115 million.  
-16 july the total marketcap of cryptocurrancies 67 million  

Trigger: The first  bitcoin -1.61%  fork?  

Second crash:  
-1 september the total marketcap of cryptocurrancies was 174 million.  
-15 september the total marketcap of cryptocurrancies was 109 million.  

Trigger: China Ban?  

The last and upcomming crash>  
It should be time for a correction of the total market! I think there is a huge change.  

Trigger: I really think the Tether usd hack could trigger a crash.  

Last thing I want to say, I try to do an objective view. I believe it will happen. You don't have to agree with me, take your own conclusion!

The bitcoin dominance is 56%. So the total marketcap of the other coins should be 44%. 

Total marketcap: 54.000.000.000 / 44% = 122.727.000.000 usd 
Bitcoin: 122.727.000.000 - 54.000.000.000 = 68.727.000.000 usd 

So the bitcoin should multiplied by 68.727.000.000 / 138.000.000.000 = 50%

Hello guys, 

XMR has reached it's bottom and if 150USD stays unbroken, we can clearly assume it. It may move to the upper downtrend line in few days. 

Target date is around June 15th. As you can see, there is always 50 days between each high. 

Let's see if this pattern plays out again ! If so, there is a nice 20% to make ! :) 

BUY : 150 - 160 
SELL : 200 - 220 
STOP : 145 

Feel free to comment and follow.  

Cheers,

On this occasion we are looking for an entry in the XMR and USD parity to open a long position that takes us to a price of around 152 USD.  

We have to be aware of the confirmation of buying signal that is currently developing.  

Buy strategy: 
1) The price (candle) closed above the Kijun (pink line) is a well-known strategy using  Ichimoku . 
2) But, we prefer a confirmation, then we wait for Tenkan (blue line) crossing Kijun (pink line). 

MACD+DI also can provide us further confirmation of the signal (green points). 
The  RSI  is currently above 50. It is an indication of a  bullish  market.

					Quoted for possible truth:  

""It's not about HW wallets or anything, XMR is being price suppressed because big players are accumulating it big time. As someone said smart money is well aware of monero and they want to keep it as much as they can for themselves until inflation is low and they can mark the price way up 

Didn't you guys notice we always are the last to pump ? its because pump happen in hierarchical orders, first you get the shittest of the the shitcoins with the wierd names like GROESTLECOIN and so on, then you got noob coins and strange coins and semi good coins, and when smart money has taken dumb money for as much as they can they pump XMR because they need to store their accumulated wealth somewhere, and whats the better place than monero? 

Next year, we'll be at 4% inflation, this is bitcoin level now, and then quickly we'll be under bitcoin yearly inflation... this will be the time to mark up the price BIG TIME, I'm talking BTC current level 

This is a slow play, this is like poker when you got quad aces and you want to take as much as you can from the noobs, you take your time, you let dumb money bids and buy DRAGONCHAIN and then you put your profit back into XMR.  

RINSE and REPEAT until we're at 2-3% inflation and price is above 10K and doesn't come back. ""

This is my idea for Monero. In my eyes XMR is the leader when it comes to private crypto transactions. However, 
I am not sure how big of an impact regulations will have on privacy coins. This idea is just based on previous chart patterns without considering fundamentals.

Nov 21, 2017




I tried to make a good reflection of the whole cryptomarket. I only could do this with coins that been trading for more than a year. Otherwise the chart did not work. So I made a chart with the following coins: 
BTC -1.61% , ETH, XRP, LTC, DASH, NEO, MONERO,  XEM -1.35% 

If people also wanna chart on this chart use the following ticker: 
COINBASE:BTCUSD*16692550+BITFINEX:ETHUSD*92862174+BITTREX:XRPUSD*38622892459+BITFINEX:LTCUSD*53927233+BITTREX:DASHUSD*7701656+BITTREX:NEOUSD*65000000+BITTREX:XMRUSD*15377976+BITTREX:XEMUSD*8999999999 

About the charts 
The first chart you see is on the logic alghoritme. The second one in normal view. 

On the first alghoritme we see a big rising wedge! On the second one you see the beautifull elliot-wave pattern. The 5th wave or 3th wave up reached the 1.618 fibonacci level, the same level als the last crash.  

I think there could be an abc-correction wave. With a total retracement of the whole cryptocurrancy market of 35-55%. 

Some other information to think about. Correct me when i'm wrong! 
First crash:  
-20 june the total marketcap of cryptocurrancies was 115 million.  
-16 july the total marketcap of cryptocurrancies 67 million  

Trigger: The first  bitcoin -1.61%  fork?  

Second crash:  
-1 september the total marketcap of cryptocurrancies was 174 million.  
-15 september the total marketcap of cryptocurrancies was 109 million.  

Trigger: China Ban?  

The last and upcomming crash>  
It should be time for a correction of the total market! I think there is a huge change.  

Trigger: I really think the Tether usd hack could trigger a crash.  

Last thing I want to say, I try to do an objective view. I believe it will happen. You don't have to agree with me, take your own conclusion!

The bitcoin dominance is 56%. So the total marketcap of the other coins should be 44%. 

Total marketcap: 54.000.000.000 / 44% = 122.727.000.000 usd 
Bitcoin: 122.727.000.000 - 54.000.000.000 = 68.727.000.000 usd 

So the bitcoin should multiplied by 68.727.000.000 / 138.000.000.000 = 50%

Hello guys, 

XMR has reached it's bottom and if 150USD stays unbroken, we can clearly assume it. It may move to the upper downtrend line in few days. 

Target date is around June 15th. As you can see, there is always 50 days between each high. 

Let's see if this pattern plays out again ! If so, there is a nice 20% to make ! :) 

BUY : 150 - 160 
SELL : 200 - 220 
STOP : 145 

Feel free to comment and follow.  

Cheers,

- EMA 10 (fast) above EMA 70 (slow)

Monero is a great privacy coin with around 2X - 10X possibility this year  

We are leaning more towards 8X - 10X however due to numerous privacy coins entering larger market, we might see slower price growth  

In all this is a great investment for long term

On this occasion we are looking for an entry in the XMR and USD parity to open a long position that takes us to a price of around 152 USD.  

We have to be aware of the confirmation of buying signal that is currently developing.  

Buy strategy: 
1) The price (candle) closed above the Kijun (pink line) is a well-known strategy using  Ichimoku . 
2) But, we prefer a confirmation, then we wait for Tenkan (blue line) crossing Kijun (pink line). 

MACD+DI also can provide us further confirmation of the signal (green points). 
The  RSI  is currently above 50. It is an indication of a  bullish  market.  

Our target is 152 USD. And our Stop Loss, 113 USD. The SL is determined by the support offered by the lower line of the Kumo (cloud).  

Stay tuned of any changes and good luck!

					XMR could not stand the rise of BTC. As a result, XMR lost its bullish trend in time frames shorter than 1 hour. 

You can use the RSI as a trend reversal indicator and should expect a rebound from the 45 - 50 levels. The RSI should be kept in the upward half of the chart to validate a bearish reversal. If the latter does not occur, consider selling according to your risk level.

This is my idea for Monero. In my eyes XMR is the leader when it comes to private crypto transactions. However, 
I am not sure how big of an impact regulations will have on privacy coins. This idea is just based on previous chart patterns without considering fundamentals.

Nov 21, 2017




I tried to make a good reflection of the whole cryptomarket. I only could do this with coins that been trading for more than a year. Otherwise the chart did not work. So I made a chart with the following coins: 
BTC             , ETH, XRP, LTC, DASH, NEO, MONERO,  XEM             

If people also wanna chart on this chart use the following ticker: 
COINBASE:BTCUSD*16692550+BITFINEX:ETHUSD*92862174+BITTREX:XRPUSD*38622892459+BITFINEX:LTCUSD*53927233+BITTREX:DASHUSD*7701656+BITTREX:NEOUSD*65000000+BITTREX:XMRUSD*15377976+BITTREX:XEMUSD*8999999999 

About the charts 
The first chart you see is on the logic alghoritme. The second one in normal view. 

On the first alghoritme we see a big rising wedge! On the second one you see the beautifull elliot-wave pattern. The 5th wave or 3th wave up reached the 1.618 fibonacci level, the same level als the last crash.  

I think there could be an abc-correction wave. With a total retracement of the whole cryptocurrancy market of 35-55%. 

Some other information to think about. Correct me when i'm wrong! 
First crash:  
-20 june the total marketcap of cryptocurrancies was 115 million.  
-16 july the total marketcap of cryptocurrancies 67 million  

Trigger: The first  bitcoin              fork?  

Second crash:  
-1 september the total marketcap of cryptocurrancies was 174 million.  
-15 september the total marketcap of cryptocurrancies was 109 million.  

Trigger: China Ban?  

The last and upcomming crash>  
It should be time for a correction of the total market! I think there is a huge change.  

Trigger: I really think the Tether usd hack could trigger a crash.  

Last thing I want to say, I try to do an objective view. I believe it will happen. You don't have to agree with me, take your own conclusion!

The bitcoin dominance is 56%. So the total marketcap of the other coins should be 44%. 

Total marketcap: 54.000.000.000 / 44% = 122.727.000.000 usd 
Bitcoin: 122.727.000.000 - 54.000.000.000 = 68.727.000.000 usd 

So the bitcoin should multiplied by 68.727.000.000 / 138.000.000.000 = 50%

Hello guys, 

XMR has reached it's bottom and if 150USD stays unbroken, we can clearly assume it. It may move to the upper downtrend line in few days. 

Target date is around June 15th. As you can see, there is always 50 days between each high. 

Let's see if this pattern plays out again ! If so, there is a nice 20% to make ! :) 

BUY : 150 - 160 
SELL : 200 - 220 
STOP : 145 

Feel free to comment and follow.  

Cheers,

On this occasion we are looking for an entry in the XMR and USD parity to open a long position that takes us to a price of around 152 USD.  

We have to be aware of the confirmation of buying signal that is currently developing.  

Buy strategy: 
1) The price (candle) closed above the Kijun (pink line) is a well-known strategy using  Ichimoku . 
2) But, we prefer a confirmation, then we wait for Tenkan (blue line) crossing Kijun (pink line). 

MACD+DI also can provide us further confirmation of the signal (green points). 
The  RSI  is currently above 50. It is an indication of a  bullish  market.  

Our target is 152 USD. And our Stop Loss, 113 USD. The SL is determined by the support offered by the lower line of the Kumo (cloud).  

Stay tuned of any changes and good luck!

You can use the RSI as a trend reversal indicator and should expect a rebound from the 45 - 50 levels. The RSI should be kept in the upward half of the chart to validate a bearish reversal. If the latter does not occur, consider selling according to your risk level.

""It's not about HW wallets or anything, XMR is being price suppressed because big players are accumulating it big time. As someone said smart money is well aware of monero and they want to keep it as much as they can for themselves until inflation is low and they can mark the price way up 

Didn't you guys notice we always are the last to pump ? its because pump happen in hierarchical orders, first you get the shittest of the the shitcoins with the wierd names like GROESTLECOIN and so on, then you got noob coins and strange coins and semi good coins, and when smart money has taken dumb money for as much as they can they pump XMR because they need to store their accumulated wealth somewhere, and whats the better place than monero? 

Next year, we'll be at 4% inflation, this is bitcoin level now, and then quickly we'll be under bitcoin yearly inflation... this will be the time to mark up the price BIG TIME, I'm talking BTC current level 

This is a slow play, this is like poker when you got quad aces and you want to take as much as you can from the noobs, you take your time, you let dumb money bids and buy DRAGONCHAIN and then you put your profit back into XMR.  

RINSE and REPEAT until we're at 2-3% inflation and price is above 10K and doesn't come back. ""

About the charts 
The first chart you see is on the logic alghoritme. The second one in normal view. 

On the first alghoritme we see a big rising wedge! On the second one you see the beautifull elliot-wave pattern. The 5th wave or 3th wave up reached the 1.618 fibonacci level, the same level als the last crash.  

I think there could be an abc-correction wave. With a total retracement of the whole cryptocurrancy market of 35-55%. 

Some other information to think about. Correct me when i'm wrong! 
First crash:  
-20 june the total marketcap of cryptocurrancies was 115 million.  
-16 july the total marketcap of cryptocurrancies 67 million  

Trigger: The first  bitcoin              fork?  

Second crash:  
-1 september the total marketcap of cryptocurrancies was 174 million.  
-15 september the total marketcap of cryptocurrancies was 109 million.  

Trigger: China Ban?  

The last and upcomming crash>  
It should be time for a correction of the total market! I think there is a huge change.  

Trigger: I really think the Tether usd hack could trigger a crash.  

Last thing I want to say, I try to do an objective view. I believe it will happen. You don't have to agree with me, take your own conclusion!

The bitcoin dominance is 56%. So the total marketcap of the other coins should be 44%. 

Total marketcap: 54.000.000.000 / 44% = 122.727.000.000 usd 
Bitcoin: 122.727.000.000 - 54.000.000.000 = 68.727.000.000 usd 

So the bitcoin should multiplied by 68.727.000.000 / 138.000.000.000 = 50%

Hello guys, 

XMR has reached it's bottom and if 150USD stays unbroken, we can clearly assume it. It may move to the upper downtrend line in few days. 

Target date is around June 15th. As you can see, there is always 50 days between each high. 

Let's see if this pattern plays out again ! If so, there is a nice 20% to make ! :) 

BUY : 150 - 160 
SELL : 200 - 220 
STOP : 145 

Feel free to comment and follow.  

Cheers,

In all this is a great investment for long term

On this occasion we are looking for an entry in the XMR and USD parity to open a long position that takes us to a price of around 152 USD.  

We have to be aware of the confirmation of buying signal that is currently developing.  

Buy strategy: 
1) The price (candle) closed above the Kijun (pink line) is a well-known strategy using  Ichimoku . 
2) But, we prefer a confirmation, then we wait for Tenkan (blue line) crossing Kijun (pink line). 

MACD+DI also can provide us further confirmation of the signal (green points). 
The  RSI  is currently above 50. It is an indication of a  bullish  market.  

Our target is 152 USD. And our Stop Loss, 113 USD. The SL is determined by the support offered by the lower line of the Kumo (cloud).  

Stay tuned of any changes and good luck!

You can use the RSI as a trend reversal indicator and should expect a rebound from the 45 - 50 levels. The RSI should be kept in the upward half of the chart to validate a bearish reversal. If the latter does not occur, consider selling according to your risk level.

In response to the emperor’s offer of a reward for his new beloved game, the inventor asked for a single grain of rice on the first square, two on the second square, four on the third, and so on. The Emperor quickly granted this seemingly benign and humble request. 

One version of the story has the emperor going bankrupt as the 63 doublings ultimately totaled 18 million trillion grains of rice. At ten grains of rice per square inch, this requires rice fields covering twice the surface area of the Earth, oceans included. Another version of the story has the inventor losing his head.

					Quoted for possible truth:  

""It's not about HW wallets or anything, XMR is being price suppressed because big players are accumulating it big time. As someone said smart money is well aware of monero and they want to keep it as much as they can for themselves until inflation is low and they can mark the price way up 

Didn't you guys notice we always are the last to pump ? its because pump happen in hierarchical orders, first you get the shittest of the the shitcoins with the wierd names like GROESTLECOIN and so on, then you got noob coins and strange coins and semi good coins, and when smart money has taken dumb money for as much as they can they pump XMR because they need to store their accumulated wealth somewhere, and whats the better place than monero? 

Next year, we'll be at 4% inflation, this is bitcoin level now, and then quickly we'll be under bitcoin yearly inflation... this will be the time to mark up the price BIG TIME, I'm talking BTC current level 

This is a slow play, this is like poker when you got quad aces and you want to take as much as you can from the noobs, you take your time, you let dumb money bids and buy DRAGONCHAIN and then you put your profit back into XMR.  

RINSE and REPEAT until we're at 2-3% inflation and price is above 10K and doesn't come back. ""

This is my idea for Monero. In my eyes XMR is the leader when it comes to private crypto transactions. However, 
I am not sure how big of an impact regulations will have on privacy coins. This idea is just based on previous chart patterns without considering fundamentals.

Bitcoin: 122.727.000.000 - 54.000.000.000 = 68.727.000.000 usd

Hello guys, 

XMR has reached it's bottom and if 150USD stays unbroken, we can clearly assume it. It may move to the upper downtrend line in few days. 

Target date is around June 15th. As you can see, there is always 50 days between each high. 

Let's see if this pattern plays out again ! If so, there is a nice 20% to make ! :) 

BUY : 150 - 160 
SELL : 200 - 220 
STOP : 145 

Feel free to comment and follow.  

Cheers,

We are leaning more towards 8X - 10X however due to numerous privacy coins entering larger market, we might see slower price growth  

In all this is a great investment for long term

On this occasion we are looking for an entry in the XMR and USD parity to open a long position that takes us to a price of around 152 USD.  

We have to be aware of the confirmation of buying signal that is currently developing.  

Buy strategy: 
1) The price (candle) closed above the Kijun (pink line) is a well-known strategy using  Ichimoku . 
2) But, we prefer a confirmation, then we wait for Tenkan (blue line) crossing Kijun (pink line). 

MACD+DI also can provide us further confirmation of the signal (green points). 
The  RSI  is currently above 50. It is an indication of a  bullish  market.  

Our target is 152 USD. And our Stop Loss, 113 USD. The SL is determined by the support offered by the lower line of the Kumo (cloud).  

Stay tuned of any changes and good luck!

You can use the RSI as a trend reversal indicator and should expect a rebound from the 45 - 50 levels. The RSI should be kept in the upward half of the chart to validate a bearish reversal. If the latter does not occur, consider selling according to your risk level.

One version of the story has the emperor going bankrupt as the 63 doublings ultimately totaled 18 million trillion grains of rice. At ten grains of rice per square inch, this requires rice fields covering twice the surface area of the Earth, oceans included. Another version of the story has the inventor losing his head.

					Quoted for possible truth:  

""It's not about HW wallets or anything, XMR is being price suppressed because big players are accumulating it big time. As someone said smart money is well aware of monero and they want to keep it as much as they can for themselves until inflation is low and they can mark the price way up 

Didn't you guys notice we always are the last to pump ? its because pump happen in hierarchical orders, first you get the shittest of the the shitcoins with the wierd names like GROESTLECOIN and so on, then you got noob coins and strange coins and semi good coins, and when smart money has taken dumb money for as much as they can they pump XMR because they need to store their accumulated wealth somewhere, and whats the better place than monero? 

Next year, we'll be at 4% inflation, this is bitcoin level now, and then quickly we'll be under bitcoin yearly inflation... this will be the time to mark up the price BIG TIME, I'm talking BTC current level 

This is a slow play, this is like poker when you got quad aces and you want to take as much as you can from the noobs, you take your time, you let dumb money bids and buy DRAGONCHAIN and then you put your profit back into XMR.  

RINSE and REPEAT until we're at 2-3% inflation and price is above 10K and doesn't come back. ""

This is my idea for Monero. In my eyes XMR is the leader when it comes to private crypto transactions. However, 
I am not sure how big of an impact regulations will have on privacy coins. This idea is just based on previous chart patterns without considering fundamentals.

I tried to make a good reflection of the whole cryptomarket. I only could do this with coins that been trading for more than a year. Otherwise the chart did not work. So I made a chart with the following coins: 
BTC -1.60% , ETH, XRP, LTC, DASH, NEO, MONERO,  XEM -1.35% 

If people also wanna chart on this chart use the following ticker: 
COINBASE:BTCUSD*16692550+BITFINEX:ETHUSD*92862174+BITTREX:XRPUSD*38622892459+BITFINEX:LTCUSD*53927233+BITTREX:DASHUSD*7701656+BITTREX:NEOUSD*65000000+BITTREX:XMRUSD*15377976+BITTREX:XEMUSD*8999999999 

About the charts 
The first chart you see is on the logic alghoritme. The second one in normal view. 

On the first alghoritme we see a big rising wedge! On the second one you see the beautifull elliot-wave pattern. The 5th wave or 3th wave up reached the 1.618 fibonacci level, the same level als the last crash.  

I think there could be an abc-correction wave. With a total retracement of the whole cryptocurrancy market of 35-55%. 

Some other information to think about. Correct me when i'm wrong! 
First crash:  
-20 june the total marketcap of cryptocurrancies was 115 million.  
-16 july the total marketcap of cryptocurrancies 67 million  

Trigger: The first  bitcoin -1.60%  fork?  

Second crash:  
-1 september the total marketcap of cryptocurrancies was 174 million.  
-15 september the total marketcap of cryptocurrancies was 109 million.  

Trigger: China Ban?  

The last and upcomming crash>  
It should be time for a correction of the total market! I think there is a huge change.  

Trigger: I really think the Tether usd hack could trigger a crash.  

Last thing I want to say, I try to do an objective view. I believe it will happen. You don't have to agree with me, take your own conclusion!

The bitcoin dominance is 56%. So the total marketcap of the other coins should be 44%. 

Total marketcap: 54.000.000.000 / 44% = 122.727.000.000 usd 
Bitcoin: 122.727.000.000 - 54.000.000.000 = 68.727.000.000 usd

Hello guys, 

XMR has reached it's bottom and if 150USD stays unbroken, we can clearly assume it. It may move to the upper downtrend line in few days.

On this occasion we are looking for an entry in the XMR and USD parity to open a long position that takes us to a price of around 152 USD.  

We have to be aware of the confirmation of buying signal that is currently developing.  

Buy strategy: 
1) The price (candle) closed above the Kijun (pink line) is a well-known strategy using  Ichimoku . 
2) But, we prefer a confirmation, then we wait for Tenkan (blue line) crossing Kijun (pink line). 

MACD+DI also can provide us further confirmation of the signal (green points). 
The  RSI  is currently above 50. It is an indication of a  bullish  market.  

Our target is 152 USD. And our Stop Loss, 113 USD. The SL is determined by the support offered by the lower line of the Kumo (cloud).  

Stay tuned of any changes and good luck!

You can use the RSI as a trend reversal indicator and should expect a rebound from the 45 - 50 levels. The RSI should be kept in the upward half of the chart to validate a bearish reversal. If the latter does not occur, consider selling according to your risk level.

One version of the story has the emperor going bankrupt as the 63 doublings ultimately totaled 18 million trillion grains of rice. At ten grains of rice per square inch, this requires rice fields covering twice the surface area of the Earth, oceans included. Another version of the story has the inventor losing his head.

					Quoted for possible truth:  

""It's not about HW wallets or anything, XMR is being price suppressed because big players are accumulating it big time. As someone said smart money is well aware of monero and they want to keep it as much as they can for themselves until inflation is low and they can mark the price way up 

Didn't you guys notice we always are the last to pump ? its because pump happen in hierarchical orders, first you get the shittest of the the shitcoins with the wierd names like GROESTLECOIN and so on, then you got noob coins and strange coins and semi good coins, and when smart money has taken dumb money for as much as they can they pump XMR because they need to store their accumulated wealth somewhere, and whats the better place than monero? 

Next year, we'll be at 4% inflation, this is bitcoin level now, and then quickly we'll be under bitcoin yearly inflation... this will be the time to mark up the price BIG TIME, I'm talking BTC current level 

This is a slow play, this is like poker when you got quad aces and you want to take as much as you can from the noobs, you take your time, you let dumb money bids and buy DRAGONCHAIN and then you put your profit back into XMR.  

RINSE and REPEAT until we're at 2-3% inflation and price is above 10K and doesn't come back. ""

This is my idea for Monero. In my eyes XMR is the leader when it comes to private crypto transactions. However, 
I am not sure how big of an impact regulations will have on privacy coins. This idea is just based on previous chart patterns without considering fundamentals.

I tried to make a good reflection of the whole cryptomarket. I only could do this with coins that been trading for more than a year. Otherwise the chart did not work. So I made a chart with the following coins: 
BTC             , ETH, XRP, LTC, DASH, NEO, MONERO,  XEM             

If people also wanna chart on this chart use the following ticker: 
COINBASE:BTCUSD*16692550+BITFINEX:ETHUSD*92862174+BITTREX:XRPUSD*38622892459+BITFINEX:LTCUSD*53927233+BITTREX:DASHUSD*7701656+BITTREX:NEOUSD*65000000+BITTREX:XMRUSD*15377976+BITTREX:XEMUSD*8999999999 

About the charts 
The first chart you see is on the logic alghoritme. The second one in normal view. 

On the first alghoritme we see a big rising wedge! On the second one you see the beautifull elliot-wave pattern. The 5th wave or 3th wave up reached the 1.618 fibonacci level, the same level als the last crash.  

I think there could be an abc-correction wave. With a total retracement of the whole cryptocurrancy market of 35-55%. 

Some other information to think about. Correct me when i'm wrong! 
First crash:  
-20 june the total marketcap of cryptocurrancies was 115 million.  
-16 july the total marketcap of cryptocurrancies 67 million  

Trigger: The first  bitcoin              fork?  

Second crash:  
-1 september the total marketcap of cryptocurrancies was 174 million.  
-15 september the total marketcap of cryptocurrancies was 109 million.  

Trigger: China Ban?  

The last and upcomming crash>  
It should be time for a correction of the total market! I think there is a huge change.  

Trigger: I really think the Tether usd hack could trigger a crash.  

Last thing I want to say, I try to do an objective view. I believe it will happen. You don't have to agree with me, take your own conclusion!

The bitcoin dominance is 56%. So the total marketcap of the other coins should be 44%. 

Total marketcap: 54.000.000.000 / 44% = 122.727.000.000 usd 
Bitcoin: 122.727.000.000 - 54.000.000.000 = 68.727.000.000 usd

Hello guys, 

XMR has reached it's bottom and if 150USD stays unbroken, we can clearly assume it. It may move to the upper downtrend line in few days. 

Target date is around June 15th. As you can see, there is always 50 days between each high. 

Let's see if this pattern plays out again ! If so, there is a nice 20% to make ! :) 

BUY : 150 - 160 
SELL : 200 - 220 
STOP : 145

You can use the RSI as a trend reversal indicator and should expect a rebound from the 45 - 50 levels. The RSI should be kept in the upward half of the chart to validate a bearish reversal. If the latter does not occur, consider selling according to your risk level.

In response to the emperor’s offer of a reward for his new beloved game, the inventor asked for a single grain of rice on the first square, two on the second square, four on the third, and so on. The Emperor quickly granted this seemingly benign and humble request. 

One version of the story has the emperor going bankrupt as the 63 doublings ultimately totaled 18 million trillion grains of rice. At ten grains of rice per square inch, this requires rice fields covering twice the surface area of the Earth, oceans included. Another version of the story has the inventor losing his head.

Comment:
					Quoted for possible truth:  

""It's not about HW wallets or anything, XMR is being price suppressed because big players are accumulating it big time. As someone said smart money is well aware of monero and they want to keep it as much as they can for themselves until inflation is low and they can mark the price way up 

Didn't you guys notice we always are the last to pump ? its because pump happen in hierarchical orders, first you get the shittest of the the shitcoins with the wierd names like GROESTLECOIN and so on, then you got noob coins and strange coins and semi good coins, and when smart money has taken dumb money for as much as they can they pump XMR because they need to store their accumulated wealth somewhere, and whats the better place than monero? 

Next year, we'll be at 4% inflation, this is bitcoin level now, and then quickly we'll be under bitcoin yearly inflation... this will be the time to mark up the price BIG TIME, I'm talking BTC current level 

This is a slow play, this is like poker when you got quad aces and you want to take as much as you can from the noobs, you take your time, you let dumb money bids and buy DRAGONCHAIN and then you put your profit back into XMR.  

RINSE and REPEAT until we're at 2-3% inflation and price is above 10K and doesn't come back. ""

This is my idea for Monero. In my eyes XMR is the leader when it comes to private crypto transactions. However, 
I am not sure how big of an impact regulations will have on privacy coins. This idea is just based on previous chart patterns without considering fundamentals.

Nov 21, 2017




I tried to make a good reflection of the whole cryptomarket. I only could do this with coins that been trading for more than a year. Otherwise the chart did not work. So I made a chart with the following coins: 
BTC -1.58% , ETH, XRP, LTC, DASH, NEO, MONERO,  XEM -1.35% 

If people also wanna chart on this chart use the following ticker: 
COINBASE:BTCUSD*16692550+BITFINEX:ETHUSD*92862174+BITTREX:XRPUSD*38622892459+BITFINEX:LTCUSD*53927233+BITTREX:DASHUSD*7701656+BITTREX:NEOUSD*65000000+BITTREX:XMRUSD*15377976+BITTREX:XEMUSD*8999999999 

About the charts 
The first chart you see is on the logic alghoritme. The second one in normal view. 

On the first alghoritme we see a big rising wedge! On the second one you see the beautifull elliot-wave pattern. The 5th wave or 3th wave up reached the 1.618 fibonacci level, the same level als the last crash.  

I think there could be an abc-correction wave. With a total retracement of the whole cryptocurrancy market of 35-55%. 

Some other information to think about. Correct me when i'm wrong! 
First crash:  
-20 june the total marketcap of cryptocurrancies was 115 million.  
-16 july the total marketcap of cryptocurrancies 67 million  

Trigger: The first  bitcoin -1.58%  fork?  

Second crash:  
-1 september the total marketcap of cryptocurrancies was 174 million.  
-15 september the total marketcap of cryptocurrancies was 109 million.  

Trigger: China Ban?  

The last and upcomming crash>  
It should be time for a correction of the total market! I think there is a huge change.  

Trigger: I really think the Tether usd hack could trigger a crash.  

Last thing I want to say, I try to do an objective view. I believe it will happen. You don't have to agree with me, take your own conclusion!

The bitcoin dominance is 56%. So the total marketcap of the other coins should be 44%. 

Total marketcap: 54.000.000.000 / 44% = 122.727.000.000 usd 
Bitcoin: 122.727.000.000 - 54.000.000.000 = 68.727.000.000 usd 

So the bitcoin should multiplied by 68.727.000.000 / 138.000.000.000 = 50%

Hello guys, 

XMR has reached it's bottom and if 150USD stays unbroken, we can clearly assume it. It may move to the upper downtrend line in few days. 

Target date is around June 15th. As you can see, there is always 50 days between each high. 

Let's see if this pattern plays out again ! If so, there is a nice 20% to make ! :) 

BUY : 150 - 160 
SELL : 200 - 220 
STOP : 145 

Feel free to comment and follow.  

Cheers,

Monero is a great privacy coin with around 2X - 10X possibility this year  

We are leaning more towards 8X - 10X however due to numerous privacy coins entering larger market, we might see slower price growth  

In all this is a great investment for long term

On this occasion we are looking for an entry in the XMR and USD parity to open a long position that takes us to a price of around 152 USD.  

We have to be aware of the confirmation of buying signal that is currently developing.  

Buy strategy: 
1) The price (candle) closed above the Kijun (pink line) is a well-known strategy using  Ichimoku . 
2) But, we prefer a confirmation, then we wait for Tenkan (blue line) crossing Kijun (pink line). 

MACD+DI also can provide us further confirmation of the signal (green points). 
The  RSI  is currently above 50. It is an indication of a  bullish  market.  

Our target is 152 USD. And our Stop Loss, 113 USD. The SL is determined by the support offered by the lower line of the Kumo (cloud).  

Stay tuned of any changes and good luck!

Comment:
					Quoted for possible truth:  

""It's not about HW wallets or anything, XMR is being price suppressed because big players are accumulating it big time. As someone said smart money is well aware of monero and they want to keep it as much as they can for themselves until inflation is low and they can mark the price way up 

Didn't you guys notice we always are the last to pump ? its because pump happen in hierarchical orders, first you get the shittest of the the shitcoins with the wierd names like GROESTLECOIN and so on, then you got noob coins and strange coins and semi good coins, and when smart money has taken dumb money for as much as they can they pump XMR because they need to store their accumulated wealth somewhere, and whats the better place than monero? 

Next year, we'll be at 4% inflation, this is bitcoin level now, and then quickly we'll be under bitcoin yearly inflation... this will be the time to mark up the price BIG TIME, I'm talking BTC current level 

This is a slow play, this is like poker when you got quad aces and you want to take as much as you can from the noobs, you take your time, you let dumb money bids and buy DRAGONCHAIN and then you put your profit back into XMR.  

RINSE and REPEAT until we're at 2-3% inflation and price is above 10K and doesn't come back. ""

This is my idea for Monero. In my eyes XMR is the leader when it comes to private crypto transactions. However, 
I am not sure how big of an impact regulations will have on privacy coins. This idea is just based on previous chart patterns without considering fundamentals.

Nov 21, 2017




I tried to make a good reflection of the whole cryptomarket. I only could do this with coins that been trading for more than a year. Otherwise the chart did not work. So I made a chart with the following coins: 
BTC -1.56% , ETH, XRP, LTC, DASH, NEO, MONERO,  XEM -1.35% 

If people also wanna chart on this chart use the following ticker: 
COINBASE:BTCUSD*16692550+BITFINEX:ETHUSD*92862174+BITTREX:XRPUSD*38622892459+BITFINEX:LTCUSD*53927233+BITTREX:DASHUSD*7701656+BITTREX:NEOUSD*65000000+BITTREX:XMRUSD*15377976+BITTREX:XEMUSD*8999999999 

About the charts 
The first chart you see is on the logic alghoritme. The second one in normal view. 

On the first alghoritme we see a big rising wedge! On the second one you see the beautifull elliot-wave pattern. The 5th wave or 3th wave up reached the 1.618 fibonacci level, the same level als the last crash.  

I think there could be an abc-correction wave. With a total retracement of the whole cryptocurrancy market of 35-55%. 

Some other information to think about. Correct me when i'm wrong! 
First crash:  
-20 june the total marketcap of cryptocurrancies was 115 million.  
-16 july the total marketcap of cryptocurrancies 67 million  

Trigger: The first  bitcoin -1.56%  fork?  

Second crash:  
-1 september the total marketcap of cryptocurrancies was 174 million.  
-15 september the total marketcap of cryptocurrancies was 109 million.  

Trigger: China Ban?  

The last and upcomming crash>  
It should be time for a correction of the total market! I think there is a huge change.  

Trigger: I really think the Tether usd hack could trigger a crash.  

Last thing I want to say, I try to do an objective view. I believe it will happen. You don't have to agree with me, take your own conclusion!

The bitcoin dominance is 56%. So the total marketcap of the other coins should be 44%. 

Total marketcap: 54.000.000.000 / 44% = 122.727.000.000 usd 
Bitcoin: 122.727.000.000 - 54.000.000.000 = 68.727.000.000 usd 

So the bitcoin should multiplied by 68.727.000.000 / 138.000.000.000 = 50%

Hello guys, 

XMR has reached it's bottom and if 150USD stays unbroken, we can clearly assume it. It may move to the upper downtrend line in few days. 

Target date is around June 15th. As you can see, there is always 50 days between each high. 

Let's see if this pattern plays out again ! If so, there is a nice 20% to make ! :) 

BUY : 150 - 160 
SELL : 200 - 220 
STOP : 145 

Feel free to comment and follow.  

Cheers,

Monero is a great privacy coin with around 2X - 10X possibility this year  

We are leaning more towards 8X - 10X however due to numerous privacy coins entering larger market, we might see slower price growth  

In all this is a great investment for long term

On this occasion we are looking for an entry in the XMR and USD parity to open a long position that takes us to a price of around 152 USD.  

We have to be aware of the confirmation of buying signal that is currently developing.  

Buy strategy: 
1) The price (candle) closed above the Kijun (pink line) is a well-known strategy using  Ichimoku . 
2) But, we prefer a confirmation, then we wait for Tenkan (blue line) crossing Kijun (pink line). 

MACD+DI also can provide us further confirmation of the signal (green points). 
The  RSI  is currently above 50. It is an indication of a  bullish  market.  

Our target is 152 USD. And our Stop Loss, 113 USD. The SL is determined by the support offered by the lower line of the Kumo (cloud).  

Stay tuned of any changes and good luck!

					XMR could not stand the rise of BTC. As a result, XMR lost its bullish trend in time frames shorter than 1 hour. 

You can use the RSI as a trend reversal indicator and should expect a rebound from the 45 - 50 levels. The RSI should be kept in the upward half of the chart to validate a bearish reversal. If the latter does not occur, consider selling according to your risk level.

Nov 21, 2017




I tried to make a good reflection of the whole cryptomarket. I only could do this with coins that been trading for more than a year. Otherwise the chart did not work. So I made a chart with the following coins: 
BTC -1.53% , ETH, XRP, LTC, DASH, NEO, MONERO,  XEM -1.35% 

If people also wanna chart on this chart use the following ticker: 
COINBASE:BTCUSD*16692550+BITFINEX:ETHUSD*92862174+BITTREX:XRPUSD*38622892459+BITFINEX:LTCUSD*53927233+BITTREX:DASHUSD*7701656+BITTREX:NEOUSD*65000000+BITTREX:XMRUSD*15377976+BITTREX:XEMUSD*8999999999 

About the charts 
The first chart you see is on the logic alghoritme. The second one in normal view. 

On the first alghoritme we see a big rising wedge! On the second one you see the beautifull elliot-wave pattern. The 5th wave or 3th wave up reached the 1.618 fibonacci level, the same level als the last crash.  

I think there could be an abc-correction wave. With a total retracement of the whole cryptocurrancy market of 35-55%. 

Some other information to think about. Correct me when i'm wrong! 
First crash:  
-20 june the total marketcap of cryptocurrancies was 115 million.  
-16 july the total marketcap of cryptocurrancies 67 million  

Trigger: The first  bitcoin -1.53%  fork?  

Second crash:  
-1 september the total marketcap of cryptocurrancies was 174 million.  
-15 september the total marketcap of cryptocurrancies was 109 million.  

Trigger: China Ban?  

The last and upcomming crash>  
It should be time for a correction of the total market! I think there is a huge change.  

Trigger: I really think the Tether usd hack could trigger a crash.  

Last thing I want to say, I try to do an objective view. I believe it will happen. You don't have to agree with me, take your own conclusion!

The bitcoin dominance is 56%. So the total marketcap of the other coins should be 44%. 

Total marketcap: 54.000.000.000 / 44% = 122.727.000.000 usd 
Bitcoin: 122.727.000.000 - 54.000.000.000 = 68.727.000.000 usd 

So the bitcoin should multiplied by 68.727.000.000 / 138.000.000.000 = 50%

Hello guys, 

XMR has reached it's bottom and if 150USD stays unbroken, we can clearly assume it. It may move to the upper downtrend line in few days. 

Target date is around June 15th. As you can see, there is always 50 days between each high. 

Let's see if this pattern plays out again ! If so, there is a nice 20% to make ! :) 

BUY : 150 - 160 
SELL : 200 - 220 
STOP : 145 

Feel free to comment and follow.  

Cheers,

Monero is a great privacy coin with around 2X - 10X possibility this year  

We are leaning more towards 8X - 10X however due to numerous privacy coins entering larger market, we might see slower price growth  

In all this is a great investment for long term

On this occasion we are looking for an entry in the XMR and USD parity to open a long position that takes us to a price of around 152 USD.  

We have to be aware of the confirmation of buying signal that is currently developing.  

Buy strategy: 
1) The price (candle) closed above the Kijun (pink line) is a well-known strategy using  Ichimoku . 
2) But, we prefer a confirmation, then we wait for Tenkan (blue line) crossing Kijun (pink line). 

MACD+DI also can provide us further confirmation of the signal (green points). 
The  RSI  is currently above 50. It is an indication of a  bullish  market.  

Our target is 152 USD. And our Stop Loss, 113 USD. The SL is determined by the support offered by the lower line of the Kumo (cloud).  

Stay tuned of any changes and good luck!

You can use the RSI as a trend reversal indicator and should expect a rebound from the 45 - 50 levels. The RSI should be kept in the upward half of the chart to validate a bearish reversal. If the latter does not occur, consider selling according to your risk level.

One version of the story has the emperor going bankrupt as the 63 doublings ultimately totaled 18 million trillion grains of rice. At ten grains of rice per square inch, this requires rice fields covering twice the surface area of the Earth, oceans included. Another version of the story has the inventor losing his head.

					Quoted for possible truth:  

""It's not about HW wallets or anything, XMR is being price suppressed because big players are accumulating it big time. As someone said smart money is well aware of monero and they want to keep it as much as they can for themselves until inflation is low and they can mark the price way up 

Didn't you guys notice we always are the last to pump ? its because pump happen in hierarchical orders, first you get the shittest of the the shitcoins with the wierd names like GROESTLECOIN and so on, then you got noob coins and strange coins and semi good coins, and when smart money has taken dumb money for as much as they can they pump XMR because they need to store their accumulated wealth somewhere, and whats the better place than monero? 

Next year, we'll be at 4% inflation, this is bitcoin level now, and then quickly we'll be under bitcoin yearly inflation... this will be the time to mark up the price BIG TIME, I'm talking BTC current level 

This is a slow play, this is like poker when you got quad aces and you want to take as much as you can from the noobs, you take your time, you let dumb money bids and buy DRAGONCHAIN and then you put your profit back into XMR.  

RINSE and REPEAT until we're at 2-3% inflation and price is above 10K and doesn't come back. ""

This is my idea for Monero. In my eyes XMR is the leader when it comes to private crypto transactions. However, 
I am not sure how big of an impact regulations will have on privacy coins. This idea is just based on previous chart patterns without considering fundamentals.

The first chart you see is on the logic alghoritme. The second one in normal view. 

On the first alghoritme we see a big rising wedge! On the second one you see the beautifull elliot-wave pattern. The 5th wave or 3th wave up reached the 1.618 fibonacci level, the same level als the last crash.  

I think there could be an abc-correction wave. With a total retracement of the whole cryptocurrancy market of 35-55%. 

Some other information to think about. Correct me when i'm wrong! 
First crash:  
-20 june the total marketcap of cryptocurrancies was 115 million.  
-16 july the total marketcap of cryptocurrancies 67 million  

Trigger: The first  bitcoin -1.54%  fork?  

Second crash:  
-1 september the total marketcap of cryptocurrancies was 174 million.  
-15 september the total marketcap of cryptocurrancies was 109 million.  

Trigger: China Ban?

It should be time for a correction of the total market! I think there is a huge change.

The bitcoin dominance is 56%. So the total marketcap of the other coins should be 44%. 

Total marketcap: 54.000.000.000 / 44% = 122.727.000.000 usd 
Bitcoin: 122.727.000.000 - 54.000.000.000 = 68.727.000.000 usd 

So the bitcoin should multiplied by 68.727.000.000 / 138.000.000.000 = 50%

Hello guys, 

XMR has reached it's bottom and if 150USD stays unbroken, we can clearly assume it. It may move to the upper downtrend line in few days. 

Target date is around June 15th. As you can see, there is always 50 days between each high. 

Let's see if this pattern plays out again ! If so, there is a nice 20% to make ! :) 

BUY : 150 - 160 
SELL : 200 - 220 
STOP : 145 

Feel free to comment and follow.  

Cheers,

Monero is a great privacy coin with around 2X - 10X possibility this year  

We are leaning more towards 8X - 10X however due to numerous privacy coins entering larger market, we might see slower price growth  

In all this is a great investment for long term

On this occasion we are looking for an entry in the XMR and USD parity to open a long position that takes us to a price of around 152 USD.  

We have to be aware of the confirmation of buying signal that is currently developing.  

Buy strategy: 
1) The price (candle) closed above the Kijun (pink line) is a well-known strategy using  Ichimoku . 
2) But, we prefer a confirmation, then we wait for Tenkan (blue line) crossing Kijun (pink line). 

MACD+DI also can provide us further confirmation of the signal (green points). 
The  RSI  is currently above 50. It is an indication of a  bullish  market.  

Our target is 152 USD. And our Stop Loss, 113 USD. The SL is determined by the support offered by the lower line of the Kumo (cloud).  

Stay tuned of any changes and good luck!

You can use the RSI as a trend reversal indicator and should expect a rebound from the 45 - 50 levels. The RSI should be kept in the upward half of the chart to validate a bearish reversal. If the latter does not occur, consider selling according to your risk level.

In response to the emperor’s offer of a reward for his new beloved game, the inventor asked for a single grain of rice on the first square, two on the second square, four on the third, and so on. The Emperor quickly granted this seemingly benign and humble request. 

One version of the story has the emperor going bankrupt as the 63 doublings ultimately totaled 18 million trillion grains of rice. At ten grains of rice per square inch, this requires rice fields covering twice the surface area of the Earth, oceans included. Another version of the story has the inventor losing his head.

Comment:
					Quoted for possible truth:  

""It's not about HW wallets or anything, XMR is being price suppressed because big players are accumulating it big time. As someone said smart money is well aware of monero and they want to keep it as much as they can for themselves until inflation is low and they can mark the price way up 

Didn't you guys notice we always are the last to pump ? its because pump happen in hierarchical orders, first you get the shittest of the the shitcoins with the wierd names like GROESTLECOIN and so on, then you got noob coins and strange coins and semi good coins, and when smart money has taken dumb money for as much as they can they pump XMR because they need to store their accumulated wealth somewhere, and whats the better place than monero? 

Next year, we'll be at 4% inflation, this is bitcoin level now, and then quickly we'll be under bitcoin yearly inflation... this will be the time to mark up the price BIG TIME, I'm talking BTC current level 

This is a slow play, this is like poker when you got quad aces and you want to take as much as you can from the noobs, you take your time, you let dumb money bids and buy DRAGONCHAIN and then you put your profit back into XMR.  

RINSE and REPEAT until we're at 2-3% inflation and price is above 10K and doesn't come back. ""

This is my idea for Monero. In my eyes XMR is the leader when it comes to private crypto transactions. However, 
I am not sure how big of an impact regulations will have on privacy coins. This idea is just based on previous chart patterns without considering fundamentals.

I tried to make a good reflection of the whole cryptomarket. I only could do this with coins that been trading for more than a year. Otherwise the chart did not work. So I made a chart with the following coins: 
BTC -1.68% , ETH, XRP, LTC, DASH, NEO, MONERO,  XEM             

If people also wanna chart on this chart use the following ticker: 
COINBASE:BTCUSD*16692550+BITFINEX:ETHUSD*92862174+BITTREX:XRPUSD*38622892459+BITFINEX:LTCUSD*53927233+BITTREX:DASHUSD*7701656+BITTREX:NEOUSD*65000000+BITTREX:XMRUSD*15377976+BITTREX:XEMUSD*8999999999 

About the charts 
The first chart you see is on the logic alghoritme. The second one in normal view. 

On the first alghoritme we see a big rising wedge! On the second one you see the beautifull elliot-wave pattern. The 5th wave or 3th wave up reached the 1.618 fibonacci level, the same level als the last crash.  

I think there could be an abc-correction wave. With a total retracement of the whole cryptocurrancy market of 35-55%. 

Some other information to think about. Correct me when i'm wrong! 
First crash:  
-20 june the total marketcap of cryptocurrancies was 115 million.  
-16 july the total marketcap of cryptocurrancies 67 million  

Trigger: The first  bitcoin -1.68%  fork?  

Second crash:  
-1 september the total marketcap of cryptocurrancies was 174 million.  
-15 september the total marketcap of cryptocurrancies was 109 million.  

Trigger: China Ban?  

The last and upcomming crash>  
It should be time for a correction of the total market! I think there is a huge change.  

Trigger: I really think the Tether usd hack could trigger a crash.  

Last thing I want to say, I try to do an objective view. I believe it will happen. You don't have to agree with me, take your own conclusion!

Total marketcap: 54.000.000.000 / 44% = 122.727.000.000 usd 
Bitcoin: 122.727.000.000 - 54.000.000.000 = 68.727.000.000 usd

XMR has reached it's bottom and if 150USD stays unbroken, we can clearly assume it. It may move to the upper downtrend line in few days. 

Target date is around June 15th. As you can see, there is always 50 days between each high. 

Let's see if this pattern plays out again ! If so, there is a nice 20% to make ! :) 

BUY : 150 - 160 
SELL : 200 - 220 
STOP : 145 

Feel free to comment and follow.  

Cheers,

					On a smaller timeframe (1H) we have several bullish signs :  
- XMR is evolving in an upward channel 
- A MACD bouncing on the 0 line, about to cross. 
- Ascending RSI that crossed the 50 line 
- EMA 10 (fast) above EMA 70 (slow) 
- EMA 70 (short term) crossing with EMA200 (long term) : potential reversal

Monero is a great privacy coin with around 2X - 10X possibility this year  

We are leaning more towards 8X - 10X however due to numerous privacy coins entering larger market, we might see slower price growth  

In all this is a great investment for long term  

Enjoy this trade my Crypto Maniacs, but remember to invest only what you can afford to lose or you're going right back to poverty on drop. We are not your financial advisors.

On this occasion we are looking for an entry in the XMR and USD parity to open a long position that takes us to a price of around 152 USD.  

We have to be aware of the confirmation of buying signal that is currently developing.  

Buy strategy: 
1) The price (candle) closed above the Kijun (pink line) is a well-known strategy using  Ichimoku . 
2) But, we prefer a confirmation, then we wait for Tenkan (blue line) crossing Kijun (pink line). 

MACD+DI also can provide us further confirmation of the signal (green points). 
The  RSI  is currently above 50. It is an indication of a  bullish  market.  

Our target is 152 USD. And our Stop Loss, 113 USD. The SL is determined by the support offered by the lower line of the Kumo (cloud).  

Stay tuned of any changes and good luck!

You can use the RSI as a trend reversal indicator and should expect a rebound from the 45 - 50 levels. The RSI should be kept in the upward half of the chart to validate a bearish reversal. If the latter does not occur, consider selling according to your risk level.

One version of the story has the emperor going bankrupt as the 63 doublings ultimately totaled 18 million trillion grains of rice. At ten grains of rice per square inch, this requires rice fields covering twice the surface area of the Earth, oceans included. Another version of the story has the inventor losing his head.

Comment:
					Quoted for possible truth:  

""It's not about HW wallets or anything, XMR is being price suppressed because big players are accumulating it big time. As someone said smart money is well aware of monero and they want to keep it as much as they can for themselves until inflation is low and they can mark the price way up 

Didn't you guys notice we always are the last to pump ? its because pump happen in hierarchical orders, first you get the shittest of the the shitcoins with the wierd names like GROESTLECOIN and so on, then you got noob coins and strange coins and semi good coins, and when smart money has taken dumb money for as much as they can they pump XMR because they need to store their accumulated wealth somewhere, and whats the better place than monero? 

Next year, we'll be at 4% inflation, this is bitcoin level now, and then quickly we'll be under bitcoin yearly inflation... this will be the time to mark up the price BIG TIME, I'm talking BTC current level 

This is a slow play, this is like poker when you got quad aces and you want to take as much as you can from the noobs, you take your time, you let dumb money bids and buy DRAGONCHAIN and then you put your profit back into XMR.  

RINSE and REPEAT until we're at 2-3% inflation and price is above 10K and doesn't come back. ""

This is my idea for Monero. In my eyes XMR is the leader when it comes to private crypto transactions. However, 
I am not sure how big of an impact regulations will have on privacy coins. This idea is just based on previous chart patterns without considering fundamentals.

I tried to make a good reflection of the whole cryptomarket. I only could do this with coins that been trading for more than a year. Otherwise the chart did not work. So I made a chart with the following coins: 
BTC             , ETH, XRP, LTC, DASH, NEO, MONERO,  XEM             

If people also wanna chart on this chart use the following ticker: 
COINBASE:BTCUSD*16692550+BITFINEX:ETHUSD*92862174+BITTREX:XRPUSD*38622892459+BITFINEX:LTCUSD*53927233+BITTREX:DASHUSD*7701656+BITTREX:NEOUSD*65000000+BITTREX:XMRUSD*15377976+BITTREX:XEMUSD*8999999999 

About the charts 
The first chart you see is on the logic alghoritme. The second one in normal view. 

On the first alghoritme we see a big rising wedge! On the second one you see the beautifull elliot-wave pattern. The 5th wave or 3th wave up reached the 1.618 fibonacci level, the same level als the last crash.  

I think there could be an abc-correction wave. With a total retracement of the whole cryptocurrancy market of 35-55%. 

Some other information to think about. Correct me when i'm wrong! 
First crash:  
-20 june the total marketcap of cryptocurrancies was 115 million.  
-16 july the total marketcap of cryptocurrancies 67 million  

Trigger: The first  bitcoin              fork?  

Second crash:  
-1 september the total marketcap of cryptocurrancies was 174 million.  
-15 september the total marketcap of cryptocurrancies was 109 million.  

Trigger: China Ban?  

The last and upcomming crash>  
It should be time for a correction of the total market! I think there is a huge change.  

Trigger: I really think the Tether usd hack could trigger a crash.  

Last thing I want to say, I try to do an objective view. I believe it will happen. You don't have to agree with me, take your own conclusion!

The bitcoin dominance is 56%. So the total marketcap of the other coins should be 44%. 

Total marketcap: 54.000.000.000 / 44% = 122.727.000.000 usd 
Bitcoin: 122.727.000.000 - 54.000.000.000 = 68.727.000.000 usd

Hello guys, 

XMR has reached it's bottom and if 150USD stays unbroken, we can clearly assume it. It may move to the upper downtrend line in few days. 

Target date is around June 15th. As you can see, there is always 50 days between each high. 

Let's see if this pattern plays out again ! If so, there is a nice 20% to make ! :)

On this occasion we are looking for an entry in the XMR and USD parity to open a long position that takes us to a price of around 152 USD.  

We have to be aware of the confirmation of buying signal that is currently developing.  

Buy strategy: 
1) The price (candle) closed above the Kijun (pink line) is a well-known strategy using  Ichimoku . 
2) But, we prefer a confirmation, then we wait for Tenkan (blue line) crossing Kijun (pink line). 

MACD+DI also can provide us further confirmation of the signal (green points). 
The  RSI  is currently above 50. It is an indication of a  bullish  market.  

Our target is 152 USD. And our Stop Loss, 113 USD. The SL is determined by the support offered by the lower line of the Kumo (cloud).  

Stay tuned of any changes and good luck!

You can use the RSI as a trend reversal indicator and should expect a rebound from the 45 - 50 levels. The RSI should be kept in the upward half of the chart to validate a bearish reversal. If the latter does not occur, consider selling according to your risk level.

One version of the story has the emperor going bankrupt as the 63 doublings ultimately totaled 18 million trillion grains of rice. At ten grains of rice per square inch, this requires rice fields covering twice the surface area of the Earth, oceans included. Another version of the story has the inventor losing his head.

Comment:
					Quoted for possible truth:  

""It's not about HW wallets or anything, XMR is being price suppressed because big players are accumulating it big time. As someone said smart money is well aware of monero and they want to keep it as much as they can for themselves until inflation is low and they can mark the price way up 

Didn't you guys notice we always are the last to pump ? its because pump happen in hierarchical orders, first you get the shittest of the the shitcoins with the wierd names like GROESTLECOIN and so on, then you got noob coins and strange coins and semi good coins, and when smart money has taken dumb money for as much as they can they pump XMR because they need to store their accumulated wealth somewhere, and whats the better place than monero? 

Next year, we'll be at 4% inflation, this is bitcoin level now, and then quickly we'll be under bitcoin yearly inflation... this will be the time to mark up the price BIG TIME, I'm talking BTC current level 

This is a slow play, this is like poker when you got quad aces and you want to take as much as you can from the noobs, you take your time, you let dumb money bids and buy DRAGONCHAIN and then you put your profit back into XMR.  

RINSE and REPEAT until we're at 2-3% inflation and price is above 10K and doesn't come back. ""

This is my idea for Monero. In my eyes XMR is the leader when it comes to private crypto transactions. However, 
I am not sure how big of an impact regulations will have on privacy coins. This idea is just based on previous chart patterns without considering fundamentals.

Nov 21, 2017




I tried to make a good reflection of the whole cryptomarket. I only could do this with coins that been trading for more than a year. Otherwise the chart did not work. So I made a chart with the following coins: 
BTC             , ETH, XRP, LTC, DASH, NEO, MONERO,  XEM             

If people also wanna chart on this chart use the following ticker: 
COINBASE:BTCUSD*16692550+BITFINEX:ETHUSD*92862174+BITTREX:XRPUSD*38622892459+BITFINEX:LTCUSD*53927233+BITTREX:DASHUSD*7701656+BITTREX:NEOUSD*65000000+BITTREX:XMRUSD*15377976+BITTREX:XEMUSD*8999999999 

About the charts 
The first chart you see is on the logic alghoritme. The second one in normal view. 

On the first alghoritme we see a big rising wedge! On the second one you see the beautifull elliot-wave pattern. The 5th wave or 3th wave up reached the 1.618 fibonacci level, the same level als the last crash.  

I think there could be an abc-correction wave. With a total retracement of the whole cryptocurrancy market of 35-55%. 

Some other information to think about. Correct me when i'm wrong! 
First crash:  
-20 june the total marketcap of cryptocurrancies was 115 million.  
-16 july the total marketcap of cryptocurrancies 67 million  

Trigger: The first  bitcoin              fork?  

Second crash:  
-1 september the total marketcap of cryptocurrancies was 174 million.  
-15 september the total marketcap of cryptocurrancies was 109 million.  

Trigger: China Ban?  

The last and upcomming crash>  
It should be time for a correction of the total market! I think there is a huge change.  

Trigger: I really think the Tether usd hack could trigger a crash.  

Last thing I want to say, I try to do an objective view. I believe it will happen. You don't have to agree with me, take your own conclusion!

The bitcoin dominance is 56%. So the total marketcap of the other coins should be 44%. 

Total marketcap: 54.000.000.000 / 44% = 122.727.000.000 usd 
Bitcoin: 122.727.000.000 - 54.000.000.000 = 68.727.000.000 usd 

So the bitcoin should multiplied by 68.727.000.000 / 138.000.000.000 = 50%

Hello guys, 

XMR has reached it's bottom and if 150USD stays unbroken, we can clearly assume it. It may move to the upper downtrend line in few days. 

Target date is around June 15th. As you can see, there is always 50 days between each high. 

Let's see if this pattern plays out again ! If so, there is a nice 20% to make ! :) 

BUY : 150 - 160 
SELL : 200 - 220 
STOP : 145 

Feel free to comment and follow.  

Cheers,

					Quoted for possible truth:  

""It's not about HW wallets or anything, XMR is being price suppressed because big players are accumulating it big time. As someone said smart money is well aware of monero and they want to keep it as much as they can for themselves until inflation is low and they can mark the price way up 

Didn't you guys notice we always are the last to pump ? its because pump happen in hierarchical orders, first you get the shittest of the the shitcoins with the wierd names like GROESTLECOIN and so on, then you got noob coins and strange coins and semi good coins, and when smart money has taken dumb money for as much as they can they pump XMR because they need to store their accumulated wealth somewhere, and whats the better place than monero? 

Next year, we'll be at 4% inflation, this is bitcoin level now, and then quickly we'll be under bitcoin yearly inflation... this will be the time to mark up the price BIG TIME, I'm talking BTC current level 

This is a slow play, this is like poker when you got quad aces and you want to take as much as you can from the noobs, you take your time, you let dumb money bids and buy DRAGONCHAIN and then you put your profit back into XMR.  

RINSE and REPEAT until we're at 2-3% inflation and price is above 10K and doesn't come back. ""

This is my idea for Monero. In my eyes XMR is the leader when it comes to private crypto transactions. However, 
I am not sure how big of an impact regulations will have on privacy coins. This idea is just based on previous chart patterns without considering fundamentals.

Nov 21, 2017




I tried to make a good reflection of the whole cryptomarket. I only could do this with coins that been trading for more than a year. Otherwise the chart did not work. So I made a chart with the following coins: 
BTC             , ETH, XRP, LTC, DASH, NEO, MONERO,  XEM             

If people also wanna chart on this chart use the following ticker: 
COINBASE:BTCUSD*16692550+BITFINEX:ETHUSD*92862174+BITTREX:XRPUSD*38622892459+BITFINEX:LTCUSD*53927233+BITTREX:DASHUSD*7701656+BITTREX:NEOUSD*65000000+BITTREX:XMRUSD*15377976+BITTREX:XEMUSD*8999999999 

About the charts 
The first chart you see is on the logic alghoritme. The second one in normal view. 

On the first alghoritme we see a big rising wedge! On the second one you see the beautifull elliot-wave pattern. The 5th wave or 3th wave up reached the 1.618 fibonacci level, the same level als the last crash.  

I think there could be an abc-correction wave. With a total retracement of the whole cryptocurrancy market of 35-55%. 

Some other information to think about. Correct me when i'm wrong! 
First crash:  
-20 june the total marketcap of cryptocurrancies was 115 million.  
-16 july the total marketcap of cryptocurrancies 67 million  

Trigger: The first  bitcoin              fork?  

Second crash:  
-1 september the total marketcap of cryptocurrancies was 174 million.  
-15 september the total marketcap of cryptocurrancies was 109 million.  

Trigger: China Ban?  

The last and upcomming crash>  
It should be time for a correction of the total market! I think there is a huge change.  

Trigger: I really think the Tether usd hack could trigger a crash.  

Last thing I want to say, I try to do an objective view. I believe it will happen. You don't have to agree with me, take your own conclusion!

The bitcoin dominance is 56%. So the total marketcap of the other coins should be 44%. 

Total marketcap: 54.000.000.000 / 44% = 122.727.000.000 usd 
Bitcoin: 122.727.000.000 - 54.000.000.000 = 68.727.000.000 usd 

So the bitcoin should multiplied by 68.727.000.000 / 138.000.000.000 = 50%

Hello guys, 

XMR has reached it's bottom and if 150USD stays unbroken, we can clearly assume it. It may move to the upper downtrend line in few days. 

Target date is around June 15th. As you can see, there is always 50 days between each high. 

Let's see if this pattern plays out again ! If so, there is a nice 20% to make ! :) 

BUY : 150 - 160 
SELL : 200 - 220 
STOP : 145 

Feel free to comment and follow.  

Cheers,

Monero is a great privacy coin with around 2X - 10X possibility this year  

We are leaning more towards 8X - 10X however due to numerous privacy coins entering larger market, we might see slower price growth  

In all this is a great investment for long term

On this occasion we are looking for an entry in the XMR and USD parity to open a long position that takes us to a price of around 152 USD.  

We have to be aware of the confirmation of buying signal that is currently developing.  

Buy strategy: 
1) The price (candle) closed above the Kijun (pink line) is a well-known strategy using  Ichimoku . 
2) But, we prefer a confirmation, then we wait for Tenkan (blue line) crossing Kijun (pink line). 

MACD+DI also can provide us further confirmation of the signal (green points). 
The  RSI  is currently above 50. It is an indication of a  bullish  market.  

Our target is 152 USD. And our Stop Loss, 113 USD. The SL is determined by the support offered by the lower line of the Kumo (cloud).  

Stay tuned of any changes and good luck!

You can use the RSI as a trend reversal indicator and should expect a rebound from the 45 - 50 levels. The RSI should be kept in the upward half of the chart to validate a bearish reversal. If the latter does not occur, consider selling according to your risk level.

Next year, we'll be at 4% inflation, this is bitcoin level now, and then quickly we'll be under bitcoin yearly inflation... this will be the time to mark up the price BIG TIME, I'm talking BTC current level 

This is a slow play, this is like poker when you got quad aces and you want to take as much as you can from the noobs, you take your time, you let dumb money bids and buy DRAGONCHAIN and then you put your profit back into XMR.

This is my idea for Monero. In my eyes XMR is the leader when it comes to private crypto transactions. However, 
I am not sure how big of an impact regulations will have on privacy coins. This idea is just based on previous chart patterns without considering fundamentals.

Nov 21, 2017




I tried to make a good reflection of the whole cryptomarket. I only could do this with coins that been trading for more than a year. Otherwise the chart did not work. So I made a chart with the following coins: 
BTC -1.71% , ETH, XRP, LTC, DASH, NEO, MONERO,  XEM -1.35% 

If people also wanna chart on this chart use the following ticker: 
COINBASE:BTCUSD*16692550+BITFINEX:ETHUSD*92862174+BITTREX:XRPUSD*38622892459+BITFINEX:LTCUSD*53927233+BITTREX:DASHUSD*7701656+BITTREX:NEOUSD*65000000+BITTREX:XMRUSD*15377976+BITTREX:XEMUSD*8999999999 

About the charts 
The first chart you see is on the logic alghoritme. The second one in normal view. 

On the first alghoritme we see a big rising wedge! On the second one you see the beautifull elliot-wave pattern. The 5th wave or 3th wave up reached the 1.618 fibonacci level, the same level als the last crash.  

I think there could be an abc-correction wave. With a total retracement of the whole cryptocurrancy market of 35-55%. 

Some other information to think about. Correct me when i'm wrong! 
First crash:  
-20 june the total marketcap of cryptocurrancies was 115 million.  
-16 july the total marketcap of cryptocurrancies 67 million  

Trigger: The first  bitcoin -1.71%  fork?  

Second crash:  
-1 september the total marketcap of cryptocurrancies was 174 million.  
-15 september the total marketcap of cryptocurrancies was 109 million.  

Trigger: China Ban?  

The last and upcomming crash>  
It should be time for a correction of the total market! I think there is a huge change.  

Trigger: I really think the Tether usd hack could trigger a crash.  

Last thing I want to say, I try to do an objective view. I believe it will happen. You don't have to agree with me, take your own conclusion!

The bitcoin dominance is 56%. So the total marketcap of the other coins should be 44%. 

Total marketcap: 54.000.000.000 / 44% = 122.727.000.000 usd 
Bitcoin: 122.727.000.000 - 54.000.000.000 = 68.727.000.000 usd 

So the bitcoin should multiplied by 68.727.000.000 / 138.000.000.000 = 50%

Hello guys, 

XMR has reached it's bottom and if 150USD stays unbroken, we can clearly assume it. It may move to the upper downtrend line in few days. 

Target date is around June 15th. As you can see, there is always 50 days between each high. 

Let's see if this pattern plays out again ! If so, there is a nice 20% to make ! :) 

BUY : 150 - 160 
SELL : 200 - 220 
STOP : 145 

Feel free to comment and follow.  

Cheers,

Monero is a great privacy coin with around 2X - 10X possibility this year

In all this is a great investment for long term

On this occasion we are looking for an entry in the XMR and USD parity to open a long position that takes us to a price of around 152 USD.  

We have to be aware of the confirmation of buying signal that is currently developing.  

Buy strategy: 
1) The price (candle) closed above the Kijun (pink line) is a well-known strategy using  Ichimoku . 
2) But, we prefer a confirmation, then we wait for Tenkan (blue line) crossing Kijun (pink line). 

MACD+DI also can provide us further confirmation of the signal (green points). 
The  RSI  is currently above 50. It is an indication of a  bullish  market.  

Our target is 152 USD. And our Stop Loss, 113 USD. The SL is determined by the support offered by the lower line of the Kumo (cloud).  

Stay tuned of any changes and good luck!

You can use the RSI as a trend reversal indicator and should expect a rebound from the 45 - 50 levels. The RSI should be kept in the upward half of the chart to validate a bearish reversal. If the latter does not occur, consider selling according to your risk level.
