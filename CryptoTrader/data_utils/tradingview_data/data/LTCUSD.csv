1,1528425872.0,MarcPMarkets,LTCUSD: The Levels We Are Looking To Buy Are Lower.,"
 LTCUSD -1.49%  update: Tight consolidation as this market waits for  BTC -0.77%  to choose a direction. There is a lot of structural conflict in this area and the best thing to do is let these markets figure themselves out. There are no worthwhile signals to capitalize on anyway. 

As you can see on the chart, price rejected the 128 reversal zone boundary. It has also found support off of the 117 to 113 minor  support zone  (.618 of recent  bullish  structure). An adjusted  bullish trend line  is still in play which means as long as it holds, price can still grind higher. 

Even though this may be the case, there are no long setups to talk about. And as long as the 138  resistance level  (.382 of broad  bearish  structure) stays intact, it is not reasonable to expect a sustained rally any time soon. 

In times of price conflict, the best thing to do is avoid trading. Even on the inventory building side, these are not low enough prices to make them attractive.  

Also keep in mind  BTC -0.77%  is still fluctuating near a  resistance zone  which means there is still more  bearish  potential than  bullish . 

At S.C., our plan is to see if these markets offer opportunities by retesting significant lows. In this market those would be the 113 or sub 108 areas. If price can develop reversal candles in these areas, a swing trade long idea may be in order. Otherwise we are not initiating any new longs.  

Quiet markets are good for two things: researching undervalued high potential alts and quietly accumulating them. You want to buy them when the herd is not excited or not looking, NOT when they are being hyped by every coin blog in existence. On S.C. we always make it a point to write about the ones that we see the most potential in. Instead of getting caught in forced trades, research your next possibility.

Pay no attention to little old LTC....Nothing to see here. 
....it's just a little  bullish .  

EMAs and pink line are levels to watch for resistance above us in a  bullish  scenario. 

Pink line is a potential IH&S neckline to watch although  volume  has been too sketchy for me to call that pattern with any confidence. It is a  resistance level  regardless. If we shoot through it, that's an obvious signal that bulls are in control. 

Bearish  scenario/further ranging with a close below 116. 

In between 123 and 116 is kind of purgatory for now. Things are unclear, although I'm losing hope of getting any more LTC for $98, like I did back in December. That doesn't mean I'm saying throw your whole stack into the market right now. There may be some better, more comfortable deals incoming. 

Measure twice, cut once.

Well I have not posted much on LTC because nothing work while to report until now. LTC is having a hard time deciding where it wants to go. Right now we have a 2 possible patterns forming: a  H&S  or an  ascending triangle . I personally think we will is a breakout in the next 3 days. Now up or down is the question. If we break down it will be a serious selloff as people are now looking for easy money and LTC is not giving that to anyone. Sideways is a game I am terrible at and I had some losing trades until I just took a step back. 

This is a waiting game as of now. We are making lower highs but for any significant move we need some  volume  and right now the buyers must all be on vacation. 

Right now, I wait and decide what is the best move and when the dominant pattern shows i'll play it.

Well I have not posted much on LTC because nothing work while to report until now. LTC is having a hard time deciding where it wants to go. Right now we have a 2 possible patterns forming: a  H&S  or an  ascending triangle . I personally think we will is a breakout in the next 3 days. Now up or down is the question. If we break down it will be a serious selloff as people are now looking for easy money and LTC is not giving that to anyone. Sideways is a game I am terrible at and I had some losing trades until I just took a step back. 

This is a waiting game as of now. We are making lower highs but for any significant move we need some  volume  and right now the buyers must all be on vacation. 

Right now, I wait and decide what is the best move and when the dominant pattern shows i'll play it.

55,1528425872.0,MarcPMarkets,LTCUSD: The Levels We Are Looking To Buy Are Lower.,"
 LTCUSD              update: Tight consolidation as this market waits for  BTC -0.71%  to choose a direction. There is a lot of structural conflict in this area and the best thing to do is let these markets figure themselves out. There are no worthwhile signals to capitalize on anyway. 

As you can see on the chart, price rejected the 128 reversal zone boundary. It has also found support off of the 117 to 113 minor  support zone  (.618 of recent  bullish  structure). An adjusted  bullish trend line  is still in play which means as long as it holds, price can still grind higher. 

Even though this may be the case, there are no long setups to talk about. And as long as the 138  resistance level  (.382 of broad  bearish  structure) stays intact, it is not reasonable to expect a sustained rally any time soon. 

In times of price conflict, the best thing to do is avoid trading. Even on the inventory building side, these are not low enough prices to make them attractive.  

Also keep in mind  BTC -0.71%  is still fluctuating near a  resistance zone  which means there is still more  bearish  potential than  bullish . 

At S.C., our plan is to see if these markets offer opportunities by retesting significant lows. In this market those would be the 113 or sub 108 areas. If price can develop reversal candles in these areas, a swing trade long idea may be in order. Otherwise we are not initiating any new longs.  

Quiet markets are good for two things: researching undervalued high potential alts and quietly accumulating them. You want to buy them when the herd is not excited or not looking, NOT when they are being hyped by every coin blog in existence. On S.C. we always make it a point to write about the ones that we see the most potential in. Instead of getting caught in forced trades, research your next possibility.

As you can see in this chart, LTC  daily chart  has a strong support around $110. This time, LTC touched this line again and now for short term, we believe it could go up to $140. In that point, if it could break the  trend line , we could say the downtrend will be finished.

91,1528425872.0,MarcPMarkets,LTCUSD: The Levels We Are Looking To Buy Are Lower.,"
 LTCUSD -1.36%  update: Tight consolidation as this market waits for  BTC -0.71%  to choose a direction. There is a lot of structural conflict in this area and the best thing to do is let these markets figure themselves out. There are no worthwhile signals to capitalize on anyway. 

As you can see on the chart, price rejected the 128 reversal zone boundary. It has also found support off of the 117 to 113 minor  support zone  (.618 of recent  bullish  structure). An adjusted  bullish trend line  is still in play which means as long as it holds, price can still grind higher. 

Even though this may be the case, there are no long setups to talk about. And as long as the 138  resistance level  (.382 of broad  bearish  structure) stays intact, it is not reasonable to expect a sustained rally any time soon. 

In times of price conflict, the best thing to do is avoid trading. Even on the inventory building side, these are not low enough prices to make them attractive.  

Also keep in mind  BTC -0.71%  is still fluctuating near a  resistance zone  which means there is still more  bearish  potential than  bullish . 

At S.C., our plan is to see if these markets offer opportunities by retesting significant lows. In this market those would be the 113 or sub 108 areas. If price can develop reversal candles in these areas, a swing trade long idea may be in order. Otherwise we are not initiating any new longs.  

Quiet markets are good for two things: researching undervalued high potential alts and quietly accumulating them. You want to buy them when the herd is not excited or not looking, NOT when they are being hyped by every coin blog in existence. On S.C. we always make it a point to write about the ones that we see the most potential in. Instead of getting caught in forced trades, research your next possibility.

Pay no attention to little old LTC....Nothing to see here. 
....it's just a little  bullish .  

EMAs and pink line are levels to watch for resistance above us in a  bullish  scenario. 

Pink line is a potential IH&S neckline to watch although  volume  has been too sketchy for me to call that pattern with any confidence. It is a  resistance level  regardless. If we shoot through it, that's an obvious signal that bulls are in control. 

Bearish  scenario/further ranging with a close below 116. 

In between 123 and 116 is kind of purgatory for now. Things are unclear, although I'm losing hope of getting any more LTC for $98, like I did back in December. That doesn't mean I'm saying throw your whole stack into the market right now. There may be some better, more comfortable deals incoming.

Well I have not posted much on LTC because nothing work while to report until now. LTC is having a hard time deciding where it wants to go. Right now we have a 2 possible patterns forming: a  H&S  or an  ascending triangle . I personally think we will is a breakout in the next 3 days. Now up or down is the question. If we break down it will be a serious selloff as people are now looking for easy money and LTC is not giving that to anyone. Sideways is a game I am terrible at and I had some losing trades until I just took a step back. 

This is a waiting game as of now. We are making lower highs but for any significant move we need some  volume  and right now the buyers must all be on vacation. 

Right now, I wait and decide what is the best move and when the dominant pattern shows i'll play it.

127,1528425872.0,MarcPMarkets,LTCUSD: The Levels We Are Looking To Buy Are Lower.,"
 LTCUSD -1.32%  update: Tight consolidation as this market waits for  BTC -0.70%  to choose a direction. There is a lot of structural conflict in this area and the best thing to do is let these markets figure themselves out. There are no worthwhile signals to capitalize on anyway. 

As you can see on the chart, price rejected the 128 reversal zone boundary. It has also found support off of the 117 to 113 minor  support zone  (.618 of recent  bullish  structure). An adjusted  bullish trend line  is still in play which means as long as it holds, price can still grind higher. 

Even though this may be the case, there are no long setups to talk about. And as long as the 138  resistance level  (.382 of broad  bearish  structure) stays intact, it is not reasonable to expect a sustained rally any time soon. 

In times of price conflict, the best thing to do is avoid trading. Even on the inventory building side, these are not low enough prices to make them attractive.  

Also keep in mind  BTC -0.70%  is still fluctuating near a  resistance zone  which means there is still more  bearish  potential than  bullish . 

At S.C., our plan is to see if these markets offer opportunities by retesting significant lows. In this market those would be the 113 or sub 108 areas. If price can develop reversal candles in these areas, a swing trade long idea may be in order. Otherwise we are not initiating any new longs.  

Quiet markets are good for two things: researching undervalued high potential alts and quietly accumulating them. You want to buy them when the herd is not excited or not looking, NOT when they are being hyped by every coin blog in existence. On S.C. we always make it a point to write about the ones that we see the most potential in. Instead of getting caught in forced trades, research your next possibility.

Pay no attention to little old LTC....Nothing to see here. 
....it's just a little  bullish .  

EMAs and pink line are levels to watch for resistance above us in a  bullish  scenario. 

Pink line is a potential IH&S neckline to watch although  volume  has been too sketchy for me to call that pattern with any confidence. It is a  resistance level  regardless. If we shoot through it, that's an obvious signal that bulls are in control. 

Bearish  scenario/further ranging with a close below 116. 

In between 123 and 116 is kind of purgatory for now. Things are unclear, although I'm losing hope of getting any more LTC for $98, like I did back in December. That doesn't mean I'm saying throw your whole stack into the market right now. There may be some better, more comfortable deals incoming. 

Measure twice, cut once.

Well I have not posted much on LTC because nothing work while to report until now. LTC is having a hard time deciding where it wants to go. Right now we have a 2 possible patterns forming: a  H&S  or an  ascending triangle . I personally think we will is a breakout in the next 3 days. Now up or down is the question. If we break down it will be a serious selloff as people are now looking for easy money and LTC is not giving that to anyone. Sideways is a game I am terrible at and I had some losing trades until I just took a step back. 

This is a waiting game as of now. We are making lower highs but for any significant move we need some  volume  and right now the buyers must all be on vacation. 

Right now, I wait and decide what is the best move and when the dominant pattern shows i'll play it.

Pay no attention to little old LTC....Nothing to see here.

EMAs and pink line are levels to watch for resistance above us in a  bullish  scenario. 

Pink line is a potential IH&S neckline to watch although  volume  has been too sketchy for me to call that pattern with any confidence. It is a  resistance level  regardless. If we shoot through it, that's an obvious signal that bulls are in control. 

Bearish  scenario/further ranging with a close below 116. 

In between 123 and 116 is kind of purgatory for now. Things are unclear, although I'm losing hope of getting any more LTC for $98, like I did back in December. That doesn't mean I'm saying throw your whole stack into the market right now. There may be some better, more comfortable deals incoming.

Well I have not posted much on LTC because nothing work while to report until now. LTC is having a hard time deciding where it wants to go. Right now we have a 2 possible patterns forming: a  H&S  or an  ascending triangle . I personally think we will is a breakout in the next 3 days. Now up or down is the question. If we break down it will be a serious selloff as people are now looking for easy money and LTC is not giving that to anyone. Sideways is a game I am terrible at and I had some losing trades until I just took a step back. 

This is a waiting game as of now. We are making lower highs but for any significant move we need some  volume  and right now the buyers must all be on vacation. 

Right now, I wait and decide what is the best move and when the dominant pattern shows i'll play it.

181,1528425872.0,MarcPMarkets,LTCUSD: The Levels We Are Looking To Buy Are Lower.,"
 LTCUSD -1.36%  update: Tight consolidation as this market waits for  BTC -0.74%  to choose a direction. There is a lot of structural conflict in this area and the best thing to do is let these markets figure themselves out. There are no worthwhile signals to capitalize on anyway. 

As you can see on the chart, price rejected the 128 reversal zone boundary. It has also found support off of the 117 to 113 minor  support zone  (.618 of recent  bullish  structure). An adjusted  bullish trend line  is still in play which means as long as it holds, price can still grind higher. 

Even though this may be the case, there are no long setups to talk about. And as long as the 138  resistance level  (.382 of broad  bearish  structure) stays intact, it is not reasonable to expect a sustained rally any time soon. 

In times of price conflict, the best thing to do is avoid trading. Even on the inventory building side, these are not low enough prices to make them attractive.  

Also keep in mind  BTC -0.74%  is still fluctuating near a  resistance zone  which means there is still more  bearish  potential than  bullish . 

At S.C., our plan is to see if these markets offer opportunities by retesting significant lows. In this market those would be the 113 or sub 108 areas. If price can develop reversal candles in these areas, a swing trade long idea may be in order. Otherwise we are not initiating any new longs.  

Quiet markets are good for two things: researching undervalued high potential alts and quietly accumulating them. You want to buy them when the herd is not excited or not looking, NOT when they are being hyped by every coin blog in existence. On S.C. we always make it a point to write about the ones that we see the most potential in. Instead of getting caught in forced trades, research your next possibility.

Well I have not posted much on LTC because nothing work while to report until now. LTC is having a hard time deciding where it wants to go. Right now we have a 2 possible patterns forming: a  H&S  or an  ascending triangle . I personally think we will is a breakout in the next 3 days. Now up or down is the question. If we break down it will be a serious selloff as people are now looking for easy money and LTC is not giving that to anyone. Sideways is a game I am terrible at and I had some losing trades until I just took a step back. 

This is a waiting game as of now. We are making lower highs but for any significant move we need some  volume  and right now the buyers must all be on vacation. 

Right now, I wait and decide what is the best move and when the dominant pattern shows i'll play it.

As you can see in this chart, LTC  daily chart  has a strong support around $110. This time, LTC touched this line again and now for short term, we believe it could go up to $140. In that point, if it could break the  trend line , we could say the downtrend will be finished.

217,1528425872.0,MarcPMarkets,LTCUSD: The Levels We Are Looking To Buy Are Lower.,"
 LTCUSD -1.35%  update: Tight consolidation as this market waits for  BTC -0.75%  to choose a direction. There is a lot of structural conflict in this area and the best thing to do is let these markets figure themselves out. There are no worthwhile signals to capitalize on anyway. 

As you can see on the chart, price rejected the 128 reversal zone boundary. It has also found support off of the 117 to 113 minor  support zone  (.618 of recent  bullish  structure). An adjusted  bullish trend line  is still in play which means as long as it holds, price can still grind higher. 

Even though this may be the case, there are no long setups to talk about. And as long as the 138  resistance level  (.382 of broad  bearish  structure) stays intact, it is not reasonable to expect a sustained rally any time soon. 

In times of price conflict, the best thing to do is avoid trading. Even on the inventory building side, these are not low enough prices to make them attractive.  

Also keep in mind  BTC -0.75%  is still fluctuating near a  resistance zone  which means there is still more  bearish  potential than  bullish . 

At S.C., our plan is to see if these markets offer opportunities by retesting significant lows. In this market those would be the 113 or sub 108 areas. If price can develop reversal candles in these areas, a swing trade long idea may be in order. Otherwise we are not initiating any new longs.  

Quiet markets are good for two things: researching undervalued high potential alts and quietly accumulating them. You want to buy them when the herd is not excited or not looking, NOT when they are being hyped by every coin blog in existence. On S.C. we always make it a point to write about the ones that we see the most potential in. Instead of getting caught in forced trades, research your next possibility.

Pay no attention to little old LTC....Nothing to see here. 
....it's just a little  bullish .  

EMAs and pink line are levels to watch for resistance above us in a  bullish  scenario. 

Pink line is a potential IH&S neckline to watch although  volume  has been too sketchy for me to call that pattern with any confidence. It is a  resistance level  regardless. If we shoot through it, that's an obvious signal that bulls are in control. 

Bearish  scenario/further ranging with a close below 116. 

In between 123 and 116 is kind of purgatory for now. Things are unclear, although I'm losing hope of getting any more LTC for $98, like I did back in December. That doesn't mean I'm saying throw your whole stack into the market right now. There may be some better, more comfortable deals incoming. 

Measure twice, cut once.  
May all of life's treasure's be yours.

As you can see in this chart, LTC  daily chart  has a strong support around $110. This time, LTC touched this line again and now for short term, we believe it could go up to $140. In that point, if it could break the  trend line , we could say the downtrend will be finished.

253,1528425872.0,MarcPMarkets,LTCUSD: The Levels We Are Looking To Buy Are Lower.,"
 LTCUSD -1.36%  update: Tight consolidation as this market waits for  BTC -0.75%  to choose a direction. There is a lot of structural conflict in this area and the best thing to do is let these markets figure themselves out. There are no worthwhile signals to capitalize on anyway. 

As you can see on the chart, price rejected the 128 reversal zone boundary. It has also found support off of the 117 to 113 minor  support zone  (.618 of recent  bullish  structure). An adjusted  bullish trend line  is still in play which means as long as it holds, price can still grind higher. 

Even though this may be the case, there are no long setups to talk about. And as long as the 138  resistance level  (.382 of broad  bearish  structure) stays intact, it is not reasonable to expect a sustained rally any time soon. 

In times of price conflict, the best thing to do is avoid trading. Even on the inventory building side, these are not low enough prices to make them attractive.  

Also keep in mind  BTC -0.75%  is still fluctuating near a  resistance zone  which means there is still more  bearish  potential than  bullish . 

At S.C., our plan is to see if these markets offer opportunities by retesting significant lows. In this market those would be the 113 or sub 108 areas. If price can develop reversal candles in these areas, a swing trade long idea may be in order. Otherwise we are not initiating any new longs.  

Quiet markets are good for two things: researching undervalued high potential alts and quietly accumulating them. You want to buy them when the herd is not excited or not looking, NOT when they are being hyped by every coin blog in existence. On S.C. we always make it a point to write about the ones that we see the most potential in. Instead of getting caught in forced trades, research your next possibility.

Pay no attention to little old LTC....Nothing to see here. 
....it's just a little  bullish .  

EMAs and pink line are levels to watch for resistance above us in a  bullish  scenario. 

Pink line is a potential IH&S neckline to watch although  volume  has been too sketchy for me to call that pattern with any confidence. It is a  resistance level  regardless. If we shoot through it, that's an obvious signal that bulls are in control. 

Bearish  scenario/further ranging with a close below 116. 

In between 123 and 116 is kind of purgatory for now. Things are unclear, although I'm losing hope of getting any more LTC for $98, like I did back in December. That doesn't mean I'm saying throw your whole stack into the market right now. There may be some better, more comfortable deals incoming. 

Measure twice, cut once.  
May all of life's treasure's be yours.

Well I have not posted much on LTC because nothing work while to report until now. LTC is having a hard time deciding where it wants to go. Right now we have a 2 possible patterns forming: a  H&S  or an  ascending triangle . I personally think we will is a breakout in the next 3 days. Now up or down is the question. If we break down it will be a serious selloff as people are now looking for easy money and LTC is not giving that to anyone. Sideways is a game I am terrible at and I had some losing trades until I just took a step back. 

This is a waiting game as of now. We are making lower highs but for any significant move we need some  volume  and right now the buyers must all be on vacation. 

Right now, I wait and decide what is the best move and when the dominant pattern shows i'll play it.

At S.C., our plan is to see if these markets offer opportunities by retesting significant lows. In this market those would be the 113 or sub 108 areas. If price can develop reversal candles in these areas, a swing trade long idea may be in order. Otherwise we are not initiating any new longs.  

Quiet markets are good for two things: researching undervalued high potential alts and quietly accumulating them. You want to buy them when the herd is not excited or not looking, NOT when they are being hyped by every coin blog in existence. On S.C. we always make it a point to write about the ones that we see the most potential in. Instead of getting caught in forced trades, research your next possibility.

EMAs and pink line are levels to watch for resistance above us in a  bullish  scenario. 

Pink line is a potential IH&S neckline to watch although  volume  has been too sketchy for me to call that pattern with any confidence. It is a  resistance level  regardless. If we shoot through it, that's an obvious signal that bulls are in control. 

Bearish  scenario/further ranging with a close below 116. 

In between 123 and 116 is kind of purgatory for now. Things are unclear, although I'm losing hope of getting any more LTC for $98, like I did back in December. That doesn't mean I'm saying throw your whole stack into the market right now. There may be some better, more comfortable deals incoming.

Well I have not posted much on LTC because nothing work while to report until now. LTC is having a hard time deciding where it wants to go. Right now we have a 2 possible patterns forming: a  H&S  or an  ascending triangle . I personally think we will is a breakout in the next 3 days. Now up or down is the question. If we break down it will be a serious selloff as people are now looking for easy money and LTC is not giving that to anyone. Sideways is a game I am terrible at and I had some losing trades until I just took a step back. 

This is a waiting game as of now. We are making lower highs but for any significant move we need some  volume  and right now the buyers must all be on vacation. 

Right now, I wait and decide what is the best move and when the dominant pattern shows i'll play it.

 LTCUSD -1.30%  update: Tight consolidation as this market waits for  BTC -0.63%  to choose a direction. There is a lot of structural conflict in this area and the best thing to do is let these markets figure themselves out. There are no worthwhile signals to capitalize on anyway. 

As you can see on the chart, price rejected the 128 reversal zone boundary. It has also found support off of the 117 to 113 minor  support zone  (.618 of recent  bullish  structure). An adjusted  bullish trend line  is still in play which means as long as it holds, price can still grind higher. 

Even though this may be the case, there are no long setups to talk about. And as long as the 138  resistance level  (.382 of broad  bearish  structure) stays intact, it is not reasonable to expect a sustained rally any time soon. 

In times of price conflict, the best thing to do is avoid trading. Even on the inventory building side, these are not low enough prices to make them attractive.  

Also keep in mind  BTC -0.63%  is still fluctuating near a  resistance zone  which means there is still more  bearish  potential than  bullish .

Well I have not posted much on LTC because nothing work while to report until now. LTC is having a hard time deciding where it wants to go. Right now we have a 2 possible patterns forming: a  H&S  or an  ascending triangle . I personally think we will is a breakout in the next 3 days. Now up or down is the question. If we break down it will be a serious selloff as people are now looking for easy money and LTC is not giving that to anyone. Sideways is a game I am terrible at and I had some losing trades until I just took a step back. 

This is a waiting game as of now. We are making lower highs but for any significant move we need some  volume  and right now the buyers must all be on vacation. 

Right now, I wait and decide what is the best move and when the dominant pattern shows i'll play it.

As you can see in this chart, LTC  daily chart  has a strong support around $110. This time, LTC touched this line again and now for short term, we believe it could go up to $140. In that point, if it could break the  trend line , we could say the downtrend will be finished.

343,1528425872.0,MarcPMarkets,LTCUSD: The Levels We Are Looking To Buy Are Lower.,"
 LTCUSD -1.40%  update: Tight consolidation as this market waits for  BTC -0.71%  to choose a direction. There is a lot of structural conflict in this area and the best thing to do is let these markets figure themselves out. There are no worthwhile signals to capitalize on anyway. 

As you can see on the chart, price rejected the 128 reversal zone boundary. It has also found support off of the 117 to 113 minor  support zone  (.618 of recent  bullish  structure). An adjusted  bullish trend line  is still in play which means as long as it holds, price can still grind higher. 

Even though this may be the case, there are no long setups to talk about. And as long as the 138  resistance level  (.382 of broad  bearish  structure) stays intact, it is not reasonable to expect a sustained rally any time soon. 

In times of price conflict, the best thing to do is avoid trading. Even on the inventory building side, these are not low enough prices to make them attractive.  

Also keep in mind  BTC -0.71%  is still fluctuating near a  resistance zone  which means there is still more  bearish  potential than  bullish . 

At S.C., our plan is to see if these markets offer opportunities by retesting significant lows. In this market those would be the 113 or sub 108 areas. If price can develop reversal candles in these areas, a swing trade long idea may be in order. Otherwise we are not initiating any new longs.  

Quiet markets are good for two things: researching undervalued high potential alts and quietly accumulating them. You want to buy them when the herd is not excited or not looking, NOT when they are being hyped by every coin blog in existence. On S.C. we always make it a point to write about the ones that we see the most potential in. Instead of getting caught in forced trades, research your next possibility.

Pay no attention to little old LTC....Nothing to see here. 
....it's just a little  bullish .  

EMAs and pink line are levels to watch for resistance above us in a  bullish  scenario. 

Pink line is a potential IH&S neckline to watch although  volume  has been too sketchy for me to call that pattern with any confidence. It is a  resistance level  regardless. If we shoot through it, that's an obvious signal that bulls are in control. 

Bearish  scenario/further ranging with a close below 116. 

In between 123 and 116 is kind of purgatory for now. Things are unclear, although I'm losing hope of getting any more LTC for $98, like I did back in December. That doesn't mean I'm saying throw your whole stack into the market right now. There may be some better, more comfortable deals incoming. 

Measure twice, cut once.  
May all of life's treasure's be yours.

As you can see in this chart, LTC  daily chart  has a strong support around $110. This time, LTC touched this line again and now for short term, we believe it could go up to $140. In that point, if it could break the  trend line , we could say the downtrend will be finished.

379,1528425872.0,MarcPMarkets,LTCUSD: The Levels We Are Looking To Buy Are Lower.,"
 LTCUSD -1.56%  update: Tight consolidation as this market waits for  BTC -0.71%  to choose a direction. There is a lot of structural conflict in this area and the best thing to do is let these markets figure themselves out. There are no worthwhile signals to capitalize on anyway. 

As you can see on the chart, price rejected the 128 reversal zone boundary. It has also found support off of the 117 to 113 minor  support zone  (.618 of recent  bullish  structure). An adjusted  bullish trend line  is still in play which means as long as it holds, price can still grind higher. 

Even though this may be the case, there are no long setups to talk about. And as long as the 138  resistance level  (.382 of broad  bearish  structure) stays intact, it is not reasonable to expect a sustained rally any time soon. 

In times of price conflict, the best thing to do is avoid trading. Even on the inventory building side, these are not low enough prices to make them attractive.  

Also keep in mind  BTC -0.71%  is still fluctuating near a  resistance zone  which means there is still more  bearish  potential than  bullish . 

At S.C., our plan is to see if these markets offer opportunities by retesting significant lows. In this market those would be the 113 or sub 108 areas. If price can develop reversal candles in these areas, a swing trade long idea may be in order. Otherwise we are not initiating any new longs.  

Quiet markets are good for two things: researching undervalued high potential alts and quietly accumulating them. You want to buy them when the herd is not excited or not looking, NOT when they are being hyped by every coin blog in existence. On S.C. we always make it a point to write about the ones that we see the most potential in. Instead of getting caught in forced trades, research your next possibility.

Pay no attention to little old LTC....Nothing to see here. 
....it's just a little  bullish .  

EMAs and pink line are levels to watch for resistance above us in a  bullish  scenario. 

Pink line is a potential IH&S neckline to watch although  volume  has been too sketchy for me to call that pattern with any confidence. It is a  resistance level  regardless. If we shoot through it, that's an obvious signal that bulls are in control. 

Bearish  scenario/further ranging with a close below 116. 

In between 123 and 116 is kind of purgatory for now. Things are unclear, although I'm losing hope of getting any more LTC for $98, like I did back in December. That doesn't mean I'm saying throw your whole stack into the market right now. There may be some better, more comfortable deals incoming. 

Measure twice, cut once.  
May all of life's treasure's be yours.

Well I have not posted much on LTC because nothing work while to report until now. LTC is having a hard time deciding where it wants to go. Right now we have a 2 possible patterns forming: a  H&S  or an  ascending triangle . I personally think we will is a breakout in the next 3 days. Now up or down is the question. If we break down it will be a serious selloff as people are now looking for easy money and LTC is not giving that to anyone. Sideways is a game I am terrible at and I had some losing trades until I just took a step back. 

This is a waiting game as of now. We are making lower highs but for any significant move we need some  volume  and right now the buyers must all be on vacation. 

Right now, I wait and decide what is the best move and when the dominant pattern shows i'll play it.

 LTCUSD -1.67%  update: Tight consolidation as this market waits for  BTC -0.75%  to choose a direction. There is a lot of structural conflict in this area and the best thing to do is let these markets figure themselves out. There are no worthwhile signals to capitalize on anyway. 

As you can see on the chart, price rejected the 128 reversal zone boundary. It has also found support off of the 117 to 113 minor  support zone  (.618 of recent  bullish  structure). An adjusted  bullish trend line  is still in play which means as long as it holds, price can still grind higher. 

Even though this may be the case, there are no long setups to talk about. And as long as the 138  resistance level  (.382 of broad  bearish  structure) stays intact, it is not reasonable to expect a sustained rally any time soon. 

In times of price conflict, the best thing to do is avoid trading. Even on the inventory building side, these are not low enough prices to make them attractive.  

Also keep in mind  BTC -0.75%  is still fluctuating near a  resistance zone  which means there is still more  bearish  potential than  bullish . 

At S.C., our plan is to see if these markets offer opportunities by retesting significant lows. In this market those would be the 113 or sub 108 areas. If price can develop reversal candles in these areas, a swing trade long idea may be in order. Otherwise we are not initiating any new longs.  

Quiet markets are good for two things: researching undervalued high potential alts and quietly accumulating them. You want to buy them when the herd is not excited or not looking, NOT when they are being hyped by every coin blog in existence. On S.C. we always make it a point to write about the ones that we see the most potential in. Instead of getting caught in forced trades, research your next possibility.

Pay no attention to little old LTC....Nothing to see here. 
....it's just a little  bullish .  

EMAs and pink line are levels to watch for resistance above us in a  bullish  scenario. 

Pink line is a potential IH&S neckline to watch although  volume  has been too sketchy for me to call that pattern with any confidence. It is a  resistance level  regardless. If we shoot through it, that's an obvious signal that bulls are in control. 

Bearish  scenario/further ranging with a close below 116. 

In between 123 and 116 is kind of purgatory for now. Things are unclear, although I'm losing hope of getting any more LTC for $98, like I did back in December. That doesn't mean I'm saying throw your whole stack into the market right now. There may be some better, more comfortable deals incoming.

Well I have not posted much on LTC because nothing work while to report until now. LTC is having a hard time deciding where it wants to go. Right now we have a 2 possible patterns forming: a  H&S  or an  ascending triangle . I personally think we will is a breakout in the next 3 days. Now up or down is the question. If we break down it will be a serious selloff as people are now looking for easy money and LTC is not giving that to anyone. Sideways is a game I am terrible at and I had some losing trades until I just took a step back. 

This is a waiting game as of now. We are making lower highs but for any significant move we need some  volume  and right now the buyers must all be on vacation. 

Right now, I wait and decide what is the best move and when the dominant pattern shows i'll play it.

Well I have not posted much on LTC because nothing work while to report until now. LTC is having a hard time deciding where it wants to go. Right now we have a 2 possible patterns forming: a  H&S  or an  ascending triangle . I personally think we will is a breakout in the next 3 days. Now up or down is the question. If we break down it will be a serious selloff as people are now looking for easy money and LTC is not giving that to anyone. Sideways is a game I am terrible at and I had some losing trades until I just took a step back. 

This is a waiting game as of now. We are making lower highs but for any significant move we need some  volume  and right now the buyers must all be on vacation. 

Right now, I wait and decide what is the best move and when the dominant pattern shows i'll play it.

469,1528425872.0,MarcPMarkets,LTCUSD: The Levels We Are Looking To Buy Are Lower.,"
 LTCUSD -1.73%  update: Tight consolidation as this market waits for  BTC -0.78%  to choose a direction. There is a lot of structural conflict in this area and the best thing to do is let these markets figure themselves out. There are no worthwhile signals to capitalize on anyway. 

As you can see on the chart, price rejected the 128 reversal zone boundary. It has also found support off of the 117 to 113 minor  support zone  (.618 of recent  bullish  structure). An adjusted  bullish trend line  is still in play which means as long as it holds, price can still grind higher. 

Even though this may be the case, there are no long setups to talk about. And as long as the 138  resistance level  (.382 of broad  bearish  structure) stays intact, it is not reasonable to expect a sustained rally any time soon. 

In times of price conflict, the best thing to do is avoid trading. Even on the inventory building side, these are not low enough prices to make them attractive.  

Also keep in mind  BTC -0.78%  is still fluctuating near a  resistance zone  which means there is still more  bearish  potential than  bullish . 

At S.C., our plan is to see if these markets offer opportunities by retesting significant lows. In this market those would be the 113 or sub 108 areas. If price can develop reversal candles in these areas, a swing trade long idea may be in order. Otherwise we are not initiating any new longs.  

Quiet markets are good for two things: researching undervalued high potential alts and quietly accumulating them. You want to buy them when the herd is not excited or not looking, NOT when they are being hyped by every coin blog in existence. On S.C. we always make it a point to write about the ones that we see the most potential in. Instead of getting caught in forced trades, research your next possibility.

Pay no attention to little old LTC....Nothing to see here. 
....it's just a little  bullish .  

EMAs and pink line are levels to watch for resistance above us in a  bullish  scenario. 

Pink line is a potential IH&S neckline to watch although  volume  has been too sketchy for me to call that pattern with any confidence. It is a  resistance level  regardless. If we shoot through it, that's an obvious signal that bulls are in control. 

Bearish  scenario/further ranging with a close below 116. 

In between 123 and 116 is kind of purgatory for now. Things are unclear, although I'm losing hope of getting any more LTC for $98, like I did back in December. That doesn't mean I'm saying throw your whole stack into the market right now. There may be some better, more comfortable deals incoming. 

Measure twice, cut once.

As you can see in this chart, LTC  daily chart  has a strong support around $110. This time, LTC touched this line again and now for short term, we believe it could go up to $140. In that point, if it could break the  trend line , we could say the downtrend will be finished.

505,1528425872.0,MarcPMarkets,LTCUSD: The Levels We Are Looking To Buy Are Lower.,"
 LTCUSD -1.73%  update: Tight consolidation as this market waits for  BTC -0.75%  to choose a direction. There is a lot of structural conflict in this area and the best thing to do is let these markets figure themselves out. There are no worthwhile signals to capitalize on anyway. 

As you can see on the chart, price rejected the 128 reversal zone boundary. It has also found support off of the 117 to 113 minor  support zone  (.618 of recent  bullish  structure). An adjusted  bullish trend line  is still in play which means as long as it holds, price can still grind higher. 

Even though this may be the case, there are no long setups to talk about. And as long as the 138  resistance level  (.382 of broad  bearish  structure) stays intact, it is not reasonable to expect a sustained rally any time soon. 

In times of price conflict, the best thing to do is avoid trading. Even on the inventory building side, these are not low enough prices to make them attractive.  

Also keep in mind  BTC -0.75%  is still fluctuating near a  resistance zone  which means there is still more  bearish  potential than  bullish . 

At S.C., our plan is to see if these markets offer opportunities by retesting significant lows. In this market those would be the 113 or sub 108 areas. If price can develop reversal candles in these areas, a swing trade long idea may be in order. Otherwise we are not initiating any new longs.  

Quiet markets are good for two things: researching undervalued high potential alts and quietly accumulating them. You want to buy them when the herd is not excited or not looking, NOT when they are being hyped by every coin blog in existence. On S.C. we always make it a point to write about the ones that we see the most potential in. Instead of getting caught in forced trades, research your next possibility.

Pay no attention to little old LTC....Nothing to see here. 
....it's just a little  bullish .  

EMAs and pink line are levels to watch for resistance above us in a  bullish  scenario. 

Pink line is a potential IH&S neckline to watch although  volume  has been too sketchy for me to call that pattern with any confidence. It is a  resistance level  regardless. If we shoot through it, that's an obvious signal that bulls are in control. 

Bearish  scenario/further ranging with a close below 116. 

In between 123 and 116 is kind of purgatory for now. Things are unclear, although I'm losing hope of getting any more LTC for $98, like I did back in December. That doesn't mean I'm saying throw your whole stack into the market right now. There may be some better, more comfortable deals incoming. 

Measure twice, cut once.  
May all of life's treasure's be yours.

Well I have not posted much on LTC because nothing work while to report until now. LTC is having a hard time deciding where it wants to go. Right now we have a 2 possible patterns forming: a  H&S  or an  ascending triangle . I personally think we will is a breakout in the next 3 days. Now up or down is the question. If we break down it will be a serious selloff as people are now looking for easy money and LTC is not giving that to anyone. Sideways is a game I am terrible at and I had some losing trades until I just took a step back. 

This is a waiting game as of now. We are making lower highs but for any significant move we need some  volume  and right now the buyers must all be on vacation. 

Right now, I wait and decide what is the best move and when the dominant pattern shows i'll play it.

541,1528425872.0,MarcPMarkets,LTCUSD: The Levels We Are Looking To Buy Are Lower.,"
 LTCUSD -1.69%  update: Tight consolidation as this market waits for  BTC -0.79%  to choose a direction. There is a lot of structural conflict in this area and the best thing to do is let these markets figure themselves out. There are no worthwhile signals to capitalize on anyway. 

As you can see on the chart, price rejected the 128 reversal zone boundary. It has also found support off of the 117 to 113 minor  support zone  (.618 of recent  bullish  structure). An adjusted  bullish trend line  is still in play which means as long as it holds, price can still grind higher. 

Even though this may be the case, there are no long setups to talk about. And as long as the 138  resistance level  (.382 of broad  bearish  structure) stays intact, it is not reasonable to expect a sustained rally any time soon. 

In times of price conflict, the best thing to do is avoid trading. Even on the inventory building side, these are not low enough prices to make them attractive.  

Also keep in mind  BTC -0.79%  is still fluctuating near a  resistance zone  which means there is still more  bearish  potential than  bullish . 

At S.C., our plan is to see if these markets offer opportunities by retesting significant lows. In this market those would be the 113 or sub 108 areas. If price can develop reversal candles in these areas, a swing trade long idea may be in order. Otherwise we are not initiating any new longs.  

Quiet markets are good for two things: researching undervalued high potential alts and quietly accumulating them. You want to buy them when the herd is not excited or not looking, NOT when they are being hyped by every coin blog in existence. On S.C. we always make it a point to write about the ones that we see the most potential in. Instead of getting caught in forced trades, research your next possibility.

Pay no attention to little old LTC....Nothing to see here. 
....it's just a little  bullish .  

EMAs and pink line are levels to watch for resistance above us in a  bullish  scenario. 

Pink line is a potential IH&S neckline to watch although  volume  has been too sketchy for me to call that pattern with any confidence. It is a  resistance level  regardless. If we shoot through it, that's an obvious signal that bulls are in control. 

Bearish  scenario/further ranging with a close below 116. 

In between 123 and 116 is kind of purgatory for now. Things are unclear, although I'm losing hope of getting any more LTC for $98, like I did back in December. That doesn't mean I'm saying throw your whole stack into the market right now. There may be some better, more comfortable deals incoming.

Well I have not posted much on LTC because nothing work while to report until now. LTC is having a hard time deciding where it wants to go. Right now we have a 2 possible patterns forming: a  H&S  or an  ascending triangle . I personally think we will is a breakout in the next 3 days. Now up or down is the question. If we break down it will be a serious selloff as people are now looking for easy money and LTC is not giving that to anyone. Sideways is a game I am terrible at and I had some losing trades until I just took a step back. 

This is a waiting game as of now. We are making lower highs but for any significant move we need some  volume  and right now the buyers must all be on vacation. 

Right now, I wait and decide what is the best move and when the dominant pattern shows i'll play it.

Well I have not posted much on LTC because nothing work while to report until now. LTC is having a hard time deciding where it wants to go. Right now we have a 2 possible patterns forming: a  H&S  or an  ascending triangle . I personally think we will is a breakout in the next 3 days. Now up or down is the question. If we break down it will be a serious selloff as people are now looking for easy money and LTC is not giving that to anyone. Sideways is a game I am terrible at and I had some losing trades until I just took a step back. 

This is a waiting game as of now. We are making lower highs but for any significant move we need some  volume  and right now the buyers must all be on vacation. 

Right now, I wait and decide what is the best move and when the dominant pattern shows i'll play it.

595,1528425872.0,MarcPMarkets,LTCUSD: The Levels We Are Looking To Buy Are Lower.,"
 LTCUSD -1.61%  update: Tight consolidation as this market waits for  BTC -0.72%  to choose a direction. There is a lot of structural conflict in this area and the best thing to do is let these markets figure themselves out. There are no worthwhile signals to capitalize on anyway. 

As you can see on the chart, price rejected the 128 reversal zone boundary. It has also found support off of the 117 to 113 minor  support zone  (.618 of recent  bullish  structure). An adjusted  bullish trend line  is still in play which means as long as it holds, price can still grind higher. 

Even though this may be the case, there are no long setups to talk about. And as long as the 138  resistance level  (.382 of broad  bearish  structure) stays intact, it is not reasonable to expect a sustained rally any time soon. 

In times of price conflict, the best thing to do is avoid trading. Even on the inventory building side, these are not low enough prices to make them attractive.  

Also keep in mind  BTC -0.72%  is still fluctuating near a  resistance zone  which means there is still more  bearish  potential than  bullish . 

At S.C., our plan is to see if these markets offer opportunities by retesting significant lows. In this market those would be the 113 or sub 108 areas. If price can develop reversal candles in these areas, a swing trade long idea may be in order. Otherwise we are not initiating any new longs.  

Quiet markets are good for two things: researching undervalued high potential alts and quietly accumulating them. You want to buy them when the herd is not excited or not looking, NOT when they are being hyped by every coin blog in existence. On S.C. we always make it a point to write about the ones that we see the most potential in. Instead of getting caught in forced trades, research your next possibility.

As you can see in this chart, LTC  daily chart  has a strong support around $110. This time, LTC touched this line again and now for short term, we believe it could go up to $140. In that point, if it could break the  trend line , we could say the downtrend will be finished.

631,1528425872.0,MarcPMarkets,LTCUSD: The Levels We Are Looking To Buy Are Lower.,"
 LTCUSD -1.65%  update: Tight consolidation as this market waits for  BTC -0.78%  to choose a direction. There is a lot of structural conflict in this area and the best thing to do is let these markets figure themselves out. There are no worthwhile signals to capitalize on anyway. 

As you can see on the chart, price rejected the 128 reversal zone boundary. It has also found support off of the 117 to 113 minor  support zone  (.618 of recent  bullish  structure). An adjusted  bullish trend line  is still in play which means as long as it holds, price can still grind higher. 

Even though this may be the case, there are no long setups to talk about. And as long as the 138  resistance level  (.382 of broad  bearish  structure) stays intact, it is not reasonable to expect a sustained rally any time soon. 

In times of price conflict, the best thing to do is avoid trading. Even on the inventory building side, these are not low enough prices to make them attractive.  

Also keep in mind  BTC -0.78%  is still fluctuating near a  resistance zone  which means there is still more  bearish  potential than  bullish . 

At S.C., our plan is to see if these markets offer opportunities by retesting significant lows. In this market those would be the 113 or sub 108 areas. If price can develop reversal candles in these areas, a swing trade long idea may be in order. Otherwise we are not initiating any new longs.  

Quiet markets are good for two things: researching undervalued high potential alts and quietly accumulating them. You want to buy them when the herd is not excited or not looking, NOT when they are being hyped by every coin blog in existence. On S.C. we always make it a point to write about the ones that we see the most potential in. Instead of getting caught in forced trades, research your next possibility.

Pay no attention to little old LTC....Nothing to see here. 
....it's just a little  bullish .  

EMAs and pink line are levels to watch for resistance above us in a  bullish  scenario. 

Pink line is a potential IH&S neckline to watch although  volume  has been too sketchy for me to call that pattern with any confidence. It is a  resistance level  regardless. If we shoot through it, that's an obvious signal that bulls are in control. 

Bearish  scenario/further ranging with a close below 116. 

In between 123 and 116 is kind of purgatory for now. Things are unclear, although I'm losing hope of getting any more LTC for $98, like I did back in December. That doesn't mean I'm saying throw your whole stack into the market right now. There may be some better, more comfortable deals incoming. 

Measure twice, cut once.  
May all of life's treasure's be yours.

Well I have not posted much on LTC because nothing work while to report until now. LTC is having a hard time deciding where it wants to go. Right now we have a 2 possible patterns forming: a  H&S  or an  ascending triangle . I personally think we will is a breakout in the next 3 days. Now up or down is the question. If we break down it will be a serious selloff as people are now looking for easy money and LTC is not giving that to anyone. Sideways is a game I am terrible at and I had some losing trades until I just took a step back. 

This is a waiting game as of now. We are making lower highs but for any significant move we need some  volume  and right now the buyers must all be on vacation. 

Right now, I wait and decide what is the best move and when the dominant pattern shows i'll play it.

667,1528425872.0,MarcPMarkets,LTCUSD: The Levels We Are Looking To Buy Are Lower.,"
 LTCUSD -1.56%  update: Tight consolidation as this market waits for  BTC -0.79%  to choose a direction. There is a lot of structural conflict in this area and the best thing to do is let these markets figure themselves out. There are no worthwhile signals to capitalize on anyway. 

As you can see on the chart, price rejected the 128 reversal zone boundary. It has also found support off of the 117 to 113 minor  support zone  (.618 of recent  bullish  structure). An adjusted  bullish trend line  is still in play which means as long as it holds, price can still grind higher. 

Even though this may be the case, there are no long setups to talk about. And as long as the 138  resistance level  (.382 of broad  bearish  structure) stays intact, it is not reasonable to expect a sustained rally any time soon. 

In times of price conflict, the best thing to do is avoid trading. Even on the inventory building side, these are not low enough prices to make them attractive.  

Also keep in mind  BTC -0.79%  is still fluctuating near a  resistance zone  which means there is still more  bearish  potential than  bullish . 

At S.C., our plan is to see if these markets offer opportunities by retesting significant lows. In this market those would be the 113 or sub 108 areas. If price can develop reversal candles in these areas, a swing trade long idea may be in order. Otherwise we are not initiating any new longs.  

Quiet markets are good for two things: researching undervalued high potential alts and quietly accumulating them. You want to buy them when the herd is not excited or not looking, NOT when they are being hyped by every coin blog in existence. On S.C. we always make it a point to write about the ones that we see the most potential in. Instead of getting caught in forced trades, research your next possibility.

Pay no attention to little old LTC....Nothing to see here. 
....it's just a little  bullish .  

EMAs and pink line are levels to watch for resistance above us in a  bullish  scenario. 

Pink line is a potential IH&S neckline to watch although  volume  has been too sketchy for me to call that pattern with any confidence. It is a  resistance level  regardless. If we shoot through it, that's an obvious signal that bulls are in control. 

Bearish  scenario/further ranging with a close below 116. 

In between 123 and 116 is kind of purgatory for now. Things are unclear, although I'm losing hope of getting any more LTC for $98, like I did back in December. That doesn't mean I'm saying throw your whole stack into the market right now. There may be some better, more comfortable deals incoming. 

Measure twice, cut once.

Well I have not posted much on LTC because nothing work while to report until now. LTC is having a hard time deciding where it wants to go. Right now we have a 2 possible patterns forming: a  H&S  or an  ascending triangle . I personally think we will is a breakout in the next 3 days. Now up or down is the question. If we break down it will be a serious selloff as people are now looking for easy money and LTC is not giving that to anyone. Sideways is a game I am terrible at and I had some losing trades until I just took a step back. 

This is a waiting game as of now. We are making lower highs but for any significant move we need some  volume  and right now the buyers must all be on vacation. 

Right now, I wait and decide what is the best move and when the dominant pattern shows i'll play it.

Pay no attention to little old LTC....Nothing to see here. 
....it's just a little  bullish .  

EMAs and pink line are levels to watch for resistance above us in a  bullish  scenario. 

Pink line is a potential IH&S neckline to watch although  volume  has been too sketchy for me to call that pattern with any confidence. It is a  resistance level  regardless. If we shoot through it, that's an obvious signal that bulls are in control. 

Bearish  scenario/further ranging with a close below 116. 

In between 123 and 116 is kind of purgatory for now. Things are unclear, although I'm losing hope of getting any more LTC for $98, like I did back in December. That doesn't mean I'm saying throw your whole stack into the market right now. There may be some better, more comfortable deals incoming. 

Measure twice, cut once.

Well I have not posted much on LTC because nothing work while to report until now. LTC is having a hard time deciding where it wants to go. Right now we have a 2 possible patterns forming: a  H&S  or an  ascending triangle . I personally think we will is a breakout in the next 3 days. Now up or down is the question. If we break down it will be a serious selloff as people are now looking for easy money and LTC is not giving that to anyone. Sideways is a game I am terrible at and I had some losing trades until I just took a step back. 

This is a waiting game as of now. We are making lower highs but for any significant move we need some  volume  and right now the buyers must all be on vacation. 

Right now, I wait and decide what is the best move and when the dominant pattern shows i'll play it.

721,1528425872.0,MarcPMarkets,LTCUSD: The Levels We Are Looking To Buy Are Lower.,"
 LTCUSD -1.44%  update: Tight consolidation as this market waits for  BTC -0.71%  to choose a direction. There is a lot of structural conflict in this area and the best thing to do is let these markets figure themselves out. There are no worthwhile signals to capitalize on anyway. 

As you can see on the chart, price rejected the 128 reversal zone boundary. It has also found support off of the 117 to 113 minor  support zone  (.618 of recent  bullish  structure). An adjusted  bullish trend line  is still in play which means as long as it holds, price can still grind higher. 

Even though this may be the case, there are no long setups to talk about. And as long as the 138  resistance level  (.382 of broad  bearish  structure) stays intact, it is not reasonable to expect a sustained rally any time soon. 

In times of price conflict, the best thing to do is avoid trading. Even on the inventory building side, these are not low enough prices to make them attractive.  

Also keep in mind  BTC -0.71%  is still fluctuating near a  resistance zone  which means there is still more  bearish  potential than  bullish . 

At S.C., our plan is to see if these markets offer opportunities by retesting significant lows. In this market those would be the 113 or sub 108 areas. If price can develop reversal candles in these areas, a swing trade long idea may be in order. Otherwise we are not initiating any new longs.  

Quiet markets are good for two things: researching undervalued high potential alts and quietly accumulating them. You want to buy them when the herd is not excited or not looking, NOT when they are being hyped by every coin blog in existence. On S.C. we always make it a point to write about the ones that we see the most potential in. Instead of getting caught in forced trades, research your next possibility.

Right now we have a 2 possible patterns forming: a  H&S  or an  ascending triangle . I personally think we will is a breakout in the next 3 days. Now up or down is the question. If we break down it will be a serious selloff as people are now looking for easy money and LTC is not giving that to anyone. Sideways is a game I am terrible at and I had some losing trades until I just took a step back. 

This is a waiting game as of now. We are making lower highs but for any significant move we need some  volume  and right now the buyers must all be on vacation. 

Right now, I wait and decide what is the best move and when the dominant pattern shows i'll play it.

As you can see in this chart, LTC  daily chart  has a strong support around $110. This time, LTC touched this line again and now for short term, we believe it could go up to $140. In that point, if it could break the  trend line , we could say the downtrend will be finished.

757,1528425872.0,MarcPMarkets,LTCUSD: The Levels We Are Looking To Buy Are Lower.,"
 LTCUSD -1.45%  update: Tight consolidation as this market waits for  BTC -0.68%  to choose a direction. There is a lot of structural conflict in this area and the best thing to do is let these markets figure themselves out. There are no worthwhile signals to capitalize on anyway. 

As you can see on the chart, price rejected the 128 reversal zone boundary. It has also found support off of the 117 to 113 minor  support zone  (.618 of recent  bullish  structure). An adjusted  bullish trend line  is still in play which means as long as it holds, price can still grind higher. 

Even though this may be the case, there are no long setups to talk about. And as long as the 138  resistance level  (.382 of broad  bearish  structure) stays intact, it is not reasonable to expect a sustained rally any time soon. 

In times of price conflict, the best thing to do is avoid trading. Even on the inventory building side, these are not low enough prices to make them attractive.  

Also keep in mind  BTC -0.68%  is still fluctuating near a  resistance zone  which means there is still more  bearish  potential than  bullish . 

At S.C., our plan is to see if these markets offer opportunities by retesting significant lows. In this market those would be the 113 or sub 108 areas. If price can develop reversal candles in these areas, a swing trade long idea may be in order. Otherwise we are not initiating any new longs.  

Quiet markets are good for two things: researching undervalued high potential alts and quietly accumulating them. You want to buy them when the herd is not excited or not looking, NOT when they are being hyped by every coin blog in existence. On S.C. we always make it a point to write about the ones that we see the most potential in. Instead of getting caught in forced trades, research your next possibility.

Pay no attention to little old LTC....Nothing to see here. 
....it's just a little  bullish .  

EMAs and pink line are levels to watch for resistance above us in a  bullish  scenario. 

Pink line is a potential IH&S neckline to watch although  volume  has been too sketchy for me to call that pattern with any confidence. It is a  resistance level  regardless. If we shoot through it, that's an obvious signal that bulls are in control. 

Bearish  scenario/further ranging with a close below 116. 

In between 123 and 116 is kind of purgatory for now. Things are unclear, although I'm losing hope of getting any more LTC for $98, like I did back in December. That doesn't mean I'm saying throw your whole stack into the market right now. There may be some better, more comfortable deals incoming. 

Measure twice, cut once.  
May all of life's treasure's be yours.

As you can see in this chart, LTC  daily chart  has a strong support around $110. This time, LTC touched this line again and now for short term, we believe it could go up to $140. In that point, if it could break the  trend line , we could say the downtrend will be finished.

793,1528425872.0,MarcPMarkets,LTCUSD: The Levels We Are Looking To Buy Are Lower.,"
 LTCUSD -1.45%  update: Tight consolidation as this market waits for  BTC -0.68%  to choose a direction. There is a lot of structural conflict in this area and the best thing to do is let these markets figure themselves out. There are no worthwhile signals to capitalize on anyway. 

As you can see on the chart, price rejected the 128 reversal zone boundary. It has also found support off of the 117 to 113 minor  support zone  (.618 of recent  bullish  structure). An adjusted  bullish trend line  is still in play which means as long as it holds, price can still grind higher. 

Even though this may be the case, there are no long setups to talk about. And as long as the 138  resistance level  (.382 of broad  bearish  structure) stays intact, it is not reasonable to expect a sustained rally any time soon. 

In times of price conflict, the best thing to do is avoid trading. Even on the inventory building side, these are not low enough prices to make them attractive.  

Also keep in mind  BTC -0.68%  is still fluctuating near a  resistance zone  which means there is still more  bearish  potential than  bullish . 

At S.C., our plan is to see if these markets offer opportunities by retesting significant lows. In this market those would be the 113 or sub 108 areas. If price can develop reversal candles in these areas, a swing trade long idea may be in order. Otherwise we are not initiating any new longs.  

Quiet markets are good for two things: researching undervalued high potential alts and quietly accumulating them. You want to buy them when the herd is not excited or not looking, NOT when they are being hyped by every coin blog in existence. On S.C. we always make it a point to write about the ones that we see the most potential in. Instead of getting caught in forced trades, research your next possibility.

Pay no attention to little old LTC....Nothing to see here. 
....it's just a little  bullish .  

EMAs and pink line are levels to watch for resistance above us in a  bullish  scenario. 

Pink line is a potential IH&S neckline to watch although  volume  has been too sketchy for me to call that pattern with any confidence. It is a  resistance level  regardless. If we shoot through it, that's an obvious signal that bulls are in control. 

Bearish  scenario/further ranging with a close below 116. 

In between 123 and 116 is kind of purgatory for now. Things are unclear, although I'm losing hope of getting any more LTC for $98, like I did back in December. That doesn't mean I'm saying throw your whole stack into the market right now. There may be some better, more comfortable deals incoming. 

Measure twice, cut once.  
May all of life's treasure's be yours.

Well I have not posted much on LTC because nothing work while to report until now. LTC is having a hard time deciding where it wants to go. Right now we have a 2 possible patterns forming: a  H&S  or an  ascending triangle . I personally think we will is a breakout in the next 3 days. Now up or down is the question. If we break down it will be a serious selloff as people are now looking for easy money and LTC is not giving that to anyone. Sideways is a game I am terrible at and I had some losing trades until I just took a step back. 

This is a waiting game as of now. We are making lower highs but for any significant move we need some  volume  and right now the buyers must all be on vacation. 

Right now, I wait and decide what is the best move and when the dominant pattern shows i'll play it.

At S.C., our plan is to see if these markets offer opportunities by retesting significant lows. In this market those would be the 113 or sub 108 areas. If price can develop reversal candles in these areas, a swing trade long idea may be in order. Otherwise we are not initiating any new longs.  

Quiet markets are good for two things: researching undervalued high potential alts and quietly accumulating them. You want to buy them when the herd is not excited or not looking, NOT when they are being hyped by every coin blog in existence. On S.C. we always make it a point to write about the ones that we see the most potential in. Instead of getting caught in forced trades, research your next possibility.

Pay no attention to little old LTC....Nothing to see here.

EMAs and pink line are levels to watch for resistance above us in a  bullish  scenario. 

Pink line is a potential IH&S neckline to watch although  volume  has been too sketchy for me to call that pattern with any confidence. It is a  resistance level  regardless. If we shoot through it, that's an obvious signal that bulls are in control. 

Bearish  scenario/further ranging with a close below 116. 

In between 123 and 116 is kind of purgatory for now. Things are unclear, although I'm losing hope of getting any more LTC for $98, like I did back in December. That doesn't mean I'm saying throw your whole stack into the market right now. There may be some better, more comfortable deals incoming.

Well I have not posted much on LTC because nothing work while to report until now. LTC is having a hard time deciding where it wants to go. Right now we have a 2 possible patterns forming: a  H&S  or an  ascending triangle . I personally think we will is a breakout in the next 3 days. Now up or down is the question. If we break down it will be a serious selloff as people are now looking for easy money and LTC is not giving that to anyone. Sideways is a game I am terrible at and I had some losing trades until I just took a step back. 

This is a waiting game as of now. We are making lower highs but for any significant move we need some  volume  and right now the buyers must all be on vacation. 

Right now, I wait and decide what is the best move and when the dominant pattern shows i'll play it.

 LTCUSD -1.30%  update: Tight consolidation as this market waits for  BTC -0.64%  to choose a direction. There is a lot of structural conflict in this area and the best thing to do is let these markets figure themselves out. There are no worthwhile signals to capitalize on anyway. 

As you can see on the chart, price rejected the 128 reversal zone boundary. It has also found support off of the 117 to 113 minor  support zone  (.618 of recent  bullish  structure). An adjusted  bullish trend line  is still in play which means as long as it holds, price can still grind higher. 

Even though this may be the case, there are no long setups to talk about. And as long as the 138  resistance level  (.382 of broad  bearish  structure) stays intact, it is not reasonable to expect a sustained rally any time soon. 

In times of price conflict, the best thing to do is avoid trading. Even on the inventory building side, these are not low enough prices to make them attractive.

Well I have not posted much on LTC because nothing work while to report until now. LTC is having a hard time deciding where it wants to go. Right now we have a 2 possible patterns forming: a  H&S  or an  ascending triangle . I personally think we will is a breakout in the next 3 days. Now up or down is the question. If we break down it will be a serious selloff as people are now looking for easy money and LTC is not giving that to anyone. Sideways is a game I am terrible at and I had some losing trades until I just took a step back. 

This is a waiting game as of now. We are making lower highs but for any significant move we need some  volume  and right now the buyers must all be on vacation. 

Right now, I wait and decide what is the best move and when the dominant pattern shows i'll play it.

883,1528425872.0,MarcPMarkets,LTCUSD: The Levels We Are Looking To Buy Are Lower.,"
 LTCUSD -1.31%  update: Tight consolidation as this market waits for  BTC -0.66%  to choose a direction. There is a lot of structural conflict in this area and the best thing to do is let these markets figure themselves out. There are no worthwhile signals to capitalize on anyway. 

As you can see on the chart, price rejected the 128 reversal zone boundary. It has also found support off of the 117 to 113 minor  support zone  (.618 of recent  bullish  structure). An adjusted  bullish trend line  is still in play which means as long as it holds, price can still grind higher. 

Even though this may be the case, there are no long setups to talk about. And as long as the 138  resistance level  (.382 of broad  bearish  structure) stays intact, it is not reasonable to expect a sustained rally any time soon. 

In times of price conflict, the best thing to do is avoid trading. Even on the inventory building side, these are not low enough prices to make them attractive.  

Also keep in mind  BTC -0.66%  is still fluctuating near a  resistance zone  which means there is still more  bearish  potential than  bullish . 

At S.C., our plan is to see if these markets offer opportunities by retesting significant lows. In this market those would be the 113 or sub 108 areas. If price can develop reversal candles in these areas, a swing trade long idea may be in order. Otherwise we are not initiating any new longs.  

Quiet markets are good for two things: researching undervalued high potential alts and quietly accumulating them. You want to buy them when the herd is not excited or not looking, NOT when they are being hyped by every coin blog in existence. On S.C. we always make it a point to write about the ones that we see the most potential in. Instead of getting caught in forced trades, research your next possibility.

Pay no attention to little old LTC....Nothing to see here. 
....it's just a little  bullish .  

EMAs and pink line are levels to watch for resistance above us in a  bullish  scenario. 

Pink line is a potential IH&S neckline to watch although  volume  has been too sketchy for me to call that pattern with any confidence. It is a  resistance level  regardless. If we shoot through it, that's an obvious signal that bulls are in control. 

Bearish  scenario/further ranging with a close below 116. 

In between 123 and 116 is kind of purgatory for now. Things are unclear, although I'm losing hope of getting any more LTC for $98, like I did back in December. That doesn't mean I'm saying throw your whole stack into the market right now. There may be some better, more comfortable deals incoming. 

Measure twice, cut once.

As you can see in this chart, LTC  daily chart  has a strong support around $110. This time, LTC touched this line again and now for short term, we believe it could go up to $140. In that point, if it could break the  trend line , we could say the downtrend will be finished.

919,1528425872.0,MarcPMarkets,LTCUSD: The Levels We Are Looking To Buy Are Lower.,"
 LTCUSD -1.34%  update: Tight consolidation as this market waits for  BTC -0.67%  to choose a direction. There is a lot of structural conflict in this area and the best thing to do is let these markets figure themselves out. There are no worthwhile signals to capitalize on anyway. 

As you can see on the chart, price rejected the 128 reversal zone boundary. It has also found support off of the 117 to 113 minor  support zone  (.618 of recent  bullish  structure). An adjusted  bullish trend line  is still in play which means as long as it holds, price can still grind higher. 

Even though this may be the case, there are no long setups to talk about. And as long as the 138  resistance level  (.382 of broad  bearish  structure) stays intact, it is not reasonable to expect a sustained rally any time soon. 

In times of price conflict, the best thing to do is avoid trading. Even on the inventory building side, these are not low enough prices to make them attractive.  

Also keep in mind  BTC -0.67%  is still fluctuating near a  resistance zone  which means there is still more  bearish  potential than  bullish . 

At S.C., our plan is to see if these markets offer opportunities by retesting significant lows. In this market those would be the 113 or sub 108 areas. If price can develop reversal candles in these areas, a swing trade long idea may be in order. Otherwise we are not initiating any new longs.  

Quiet markets are good for two things: researching undervalued high potential alts and quietly accumulating them. You want to buy them when the herd is not excited or not looking, NOT when they are being hyped by every coin blog in existence. On S.C. we always make it a point to write about the ones that we see the most potential in. Instead of getting caught in forced trades, research your next possibility.

Pay no attention to little old LTC....Nothing to see here. 
....it's just a little  bullish .  

EMAs and pink line are levels to watch for resistance above us in a  bullish  scenario. 

Pink line is a potential IH&S neckline to watch although  volume  has been too sketchy for me to call that pattern with any confidence. It is a  resistance level  regardless. If we shoot through it, that's an obvious signal that bulls are in control. 

Bearish  scenario/further ranging with a close below 116. 

In between 123 and 116 is kind of purgatory for now. Things are unclear, although I'm losing hope of getting any more LTC for $98, like I did back in December. That doesn't mean I'm saying throw your whole stack into the market right now. There may be some better, more comfortable deals incoming. 

Measure twice, cut once.  
May all of life's treasure's be yours.

Well I have not posted much on LTC because nothing work while to report until now. LTC is having a hard time deciding where it wants to go. Right now we have a 2 possible patterns forming: a  H&S  or an  ascending triangle . I personally think we will is a breakout in the next 3 days. Now up or down is the question. If we break down it will be a serious selloff as people are now looking for easy money and LTC is not giving that to anyone. Sideways is a game I am terrible at and I had some losing trades until I just took a step back. 

This is a waiting game as of now. We are making lower highs but for any significant move we need some  volume  and right now the buyers must all be on vacation. 

Right now, I wait and decide what is the best move and when the dominant pattern shows i'll play it.

 LTCUSD -1.34%  update: Tight consolidation as this market waits for  BTC -0.65%  to choose a direction. There is a lot of structural conflict in this area and the best thing to do is let these markets figure themselves out. There are no worthwhile signals to capitalize on anyway. 

As you can see on the chart, price rejected the 128 reversal zone boundary. It has also found support off of the 117 to 113 minor  support zone  (.618 of recent  bullish  structure). An adjusted  bullish trend line  is still in play which means as long as it holds, price can still grind higher. 

Even though this may be the case, there are no long setups to talk about. And as long as the 138  resistance level  (.382 of broad  bearish  structure) stays intact, it is not reasonable to expect a sustained rally any time soon. 

In times of price conflict, the best thing to do is avoid trading. Even on the inventory building side, these are not low enough prices to make them attractive.  

Also keep in mind  BTC -0.65%  is still fluctuating near a  resistance zone  which means there is still more  bearish  potential than  bullish . 

At S.C., our plan is to see if these markets offer opportunities by retesting significant lows. In this market those would be the 113 or sub 108 areas. If price can develop reversal candles in these areas, a swing trade long idea may be in order. Otherwise we are not initiating any new longs.  

Quiet markets are good for two things: researching undervalued high potential alts and quietly accumulating them. You want to buy them when the herd is not excited or not looking, NOT when they are being hyped by every coin blog in existence. On S.C. we always make it a point to write about the ones that we see the most potential in. Instead of getting caught in forced trades, research your next possibility.

Pay no attention to little old LTC....Nothing to see here. 
....it's just a little  bullish .  

EMAs and pink line are levels to watch for resistance above us in a  bullish  scenario. 

Pink line is a potential IH&S neckline to watch although  volume  has been too sketchy for me to call that pattern with any confidence. It is a  resistance level  regardless. If we shoot through it, that's an obvious signal that bulls are in control. 

Bearish  scenario/further ranging with a close below 116. 

In between 123 and 116 is kind of purgatory for now. Things are unclear, although I'm losing hope of getting any more LTC for $98, like I did back in December. That doesn't mean I'm saying throw your whole stack into the market right now. There may be some better, more comfortable deals incoming.

Well I have not posted much on LTC because nothing work while to report until now. LTC is having a hard time deciding where it wants to go. Right now we have a 2 possible patterns forming: a  H&S  or an  ascending triangle . I personally think we will is a breakout in the next 3 days. Now up or down is the question. If we break down it will be a serious selloff as people are now looking for easy money and LTC is not giving that to anyone. Sideways is a game I am terrible at and I had some losing trades until I just took a step back. 

This is a waiting game as of now. We are making lower highs but for any significant move we need some  volume  and right now the buyers must all be on vacation. 

Right now, I wait and decide what is the best move and when the dominant pattern shows i'll play it.

There is almost a guarantee that when the 50 days MA (white line) crosses 200 MA (red line) a nice increase will happen. As you can see from the charts, now is a good time to buy and hold. The opposite is when the 50 days MA (white line) comes from above and crosses the 200 MA, a huge drop happens

LTC looking   bearish  here.  
So far we completed 4 waves down and are currently putting in the fifth wave.  
There is  bearish  diveregence on the oscillator implies bulls are losing strength.  
BTC -0.63%  also doesn't good in particular and also one more leg down

Well I have not posted much on LTC because nothing work while to report until now. LTC is having a hard time deciding where it wants to go. Right now we have a 2 possible patterns forming: a  H&S  or an  ascending triangle . I personally think we will is a breakout in the next 3 days. Now up or down is the question. If we break down it will be a serious selloff as people are now looking for easy money and LTC is not giving that to anyone. Sideways is a game I am terrible at and I had some losing trades until I just took a step back. 

This is a waiting game as of now. We are making lower highs but for any significant move we need some  volume  and right now the buyers must all be on vacation. 

Right now, I wait and decide what is the best move and when the dominant pattern shows i'll play it.

Classic double humpack dino formation... If his hat falls off, we go up.  If his hat tips forward we go down.  If front leg straightens out, we go sideways until the hat tips backwards, at which point we may go up or down.

Comment:
					Exactly as I described.  We had a large sideways hat tip but no fall off.  Front leg straightened out and we started to go sideways precisely where my arrow shows.

Litecoin Hasn't Been The Most exciting Coin To Trade Recently, Being One Of The Weakest Coins In The Top The General Sentiment Around LTC Is Boring, But This Is Nothing New, Litecoin Has A Habit of Being Boring Then Out of No Where Making Explosive Moves. 

Im Completey Neutral At Best On LTC Right Now, Its Struggling To Reach The  Resistance Zone  Above It, If It Breaks Down From The Ranging Zone The Reversal Is Over And It Needs To Hold At The Low Around $110. 

A Push Above The Resistance Could Bring us Some  Bullish  Momentum For A Nice Run, But Its A Waiting Game For Now.

As you can see in this chart, LTC  daily chart  has a strong support around $110. This time, LTC touched this line again and now for short term, we believe it could go up to $140. In that point, if it could break the  trend line , we could say the downtrend will be finished.
