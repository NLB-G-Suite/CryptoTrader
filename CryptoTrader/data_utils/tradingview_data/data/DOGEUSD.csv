I check 3 things before gambling some  btc -0.73%  on altcoins. 
1) Dominance 
2)  ETH/BTC -1.22% 
3) DOGE/BTC&USD 

1) According to my Dominance analyze, dominance will drop to 29-30 levels. Below those levels are our dream, the golden age of altcoins. 
2) I believe in flippening. If it's going to happen, first shitcoins should finish their pump so money can flow into eth 
3) No comment. Best shitcoin, such good much wow. I think USD pair is more important. And it shows us that 5 cent is not a dream.

I check 3 things before gambling some  btc -0.76%  on altcoins. 
1) Dominance 
2)  ETH/BTC -1.22% 
3) DOGE/BTC&USD 

1) According to my Dominance analyze, dominance will drop to 29-30 levels. Below those levels are our dream, the golden age of altcoins. 
2) I believe in flippening. If it's going to happen, first shitcoins should finish their pump so money can flow into eth 
3) No comment. Best shitcoin, such good much wow. I think USD pair is more important. And it shows us that 5 cent is not a dream.
