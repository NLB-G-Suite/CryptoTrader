Hey guys! 

As u can see in graph we got a  support Level  around 400$. 
At the Moment we are in a parallel  falling channel , with very low  RSI . 

I expect a stop around 400, and then becoming  bullish  again.

There are a few ways I see this going. There is a short term  wedge  that currently price is descending in. If price moves up from there but does not break 800-820 then I am convinced that it is in an  ascending triangle . If it does breakout then I am confident it is a  harmonic pattern . Price could also  double bottom  at 400. Bottom line is that price is looking  bullish .

Just for fun, a rather excessively detailed prediction, lets see how far off reality turns out to be. 

ETH is currently approaching the apex of an equilateral triangle - it could break up or down. In the case that it breaks up it will likely signal that 13th June was the turning point to a more  bullish  period. In this case 13th June could be the start of an  elliot  impulse wave upwards. It's likely we could bounce off the resistance at $540 and retrace 50% to support at $495 for waves 1 and 2. Wave 3 target would then be around $615 . Need to watched out for  parallel channel  behaviour below 4 perfectly aligned points towards the ends of the current formation in the triangle.. in that case it could push the lower half of the triangle out a little, so don't panic if it dips below the current lower  trend line  for a short period, it could be a bear trap. 

The behaviour and direction of break is dependent on  BTC -0.04%  which is in a similar formation. It looks like  BTC -0.04%  could come back down to $6415 before attempting a break upwards, so if I decide to go long I might look for an entry point around $490 in the next few hours.

15,1529225110.0,This_Guhy,ETH is the Chosen One and Tether Manipulation,"
This will be a long post but I hope worth the time.  I hope this encourages a lot of similar posts from the community and if it encourages a post from you on another currency please refer to this post so I can read what you wrote on the matter. 

The big news to hit crypto was the recen paper out of the  University of Texas at Austin ""Is  Bitcoin -0.04%  really Un-Tethered"" (https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3195066) which evaluated the use of tether.  Was the use of Tether demand driven (or pulled by the users, or was Tether ""pushed"" by its issuer?  There were several hypothesis testing but long story short the researchers found that less than 1% of the hours are associated with 50% of  bitcoins -0.04%  rise in  price and 64% for other currencies ( ethereum -0.64%  among them).  Long story short Tether is used to prop up the price of crypto when it tanks and it is done at predictable resistance levels.  Please review page 33 for the full conclusion (it takes up my word count to post it here). 

You can see that I separated the  volume  and price charts to more easily show the most recent peak in ETH USD  volume .  Many of the pumps in price straddle the hour mark so the 2h time frame is used to control for that.  We can see that the  volume  event that recently propped up the price of  ETHUSD -0.64%  was the 4th highest  volume  event for the year and the largest green candle  volume  event of the year so far.  That signals quite a bit of conviction/commitment to establishing a floor and the paper's conclusion suggest that the floor will be strong (and in my opinion most likely actively defended).  Perhaps very crucially this spike in  ethusd -0.64%  ESTABLISHED A  CLEARLY HIGHER LOW than our low in April.  This is important because the lows for  BTCUSD -0.04%  are higher lows, but marginally so.  THis is why I think  ETHUSD -0.64%  will get more gains than  BTCUSD -0.04%  and will be a ""chosen child"". 

I have NOT done a systemic view of every exchange and ETH trading pair but since Bitfinex is the exchange of interest I decided to see if anything was salient and boy, did I find something.   






You will also see on this both preceding charts an anomaly on february 8th for ETHBTC.   It seems that that for some unknown reason 85k ETH was sold for  BTC -0.04%  and in the following hours 133K ETH was purchased with  BTC -0.04% .  133K ETH is a curious amount because that was pretty close to the 134K that was purchased for USD a few days ago on 6-14.  If we are working within the realm of currency manipulation the first idea is they wanted to control the liquidity of either ETH or  BTC -0.04%  and when the preceding trades for 85k occured  a decisive response was necessary.  Why is 133k an important number?  That is beyond my knowledge at this point. 

Below we have the  ETHUSDT -0.60%  chart for Bitfinex, which is most closely related to the academic paper.  Spike 1 and 2 seem to be clear attempts to test the ability to slow the descent in price of  ethereum -0.64% .  Cluster 1 is probably a combination of manipulation and organic attempts to capitalize on a  RSI  bounce out of an oversold condition (I would know, I was one traders there).  Spike 3 appears to be a clearly successful attempt to continue a uptrend and it was successful.  We are in the midst of Spike 4 and it seems that once again there is an attempt to continue/create an uptrend. 







I am running out of characters for this post but safe to say, manipulation aside, I want to make money.  My kids need clothes and food and I need to pay the mortgage. Here is the 12 chart. 






 The first  MACD  cross  bullish  cross lead to over 100% price increase in  ETHUSD -0.64% .  The second was over 20%.  The pending third  bullish  cross would make me happy right now if it were anything between.  All have us bouncing out of an oversold condition and both show the  Stochastic RSI  going straight up.  As always, protect your gains and cut your losers and lets all make some money.

 Ethereum -0.64%  rate is in no hurry to continue its growth. 
Priority of the day: neutral position on  ETHUSD -0.64% . 
We are working with the trend, so we are still waiting for the end of correction to the downward movement of  Ethereum -0.64%  rate.  
Today, according to our forecast, there should be a slight increase in the rate of  Ethereum -0.64%  to $ 550. 
Projected scenarios: 
1. The  ETHUSD -0.64%  rate will rise from $ 500 to $ 550. 
2. The  ETHUSD -0.64%  rate will drop from $ 500 to $ 450. 
Alternative scenario: 
The crypto market loses liquidity, so lateral movements have become longer, and impulse - shorter. It is possible that today there will be another day of flat for  Ethereum -0.64%  rate. We have nothing to do but wait for a better situation.

17,1529212502.0,TomProTrader,ETH/USD - Levels To Buy,"
Another follow up analysis of Ethereum! Price is moving perfectly with our previous  Ethereum -0.64%  analysis! In our previous analysis, we predicted a  support level  where price could bounce bounce for a buy, then we predicted levels where price would go to! So we have perfectly predicted Ethereum's movement so far. Now we've perfectly gaged the down move, I am looking for specific buy levels in order for me to profit from waiting. 

Swiftly moving on to the analysis,  Ethereum -0.64%  on the 12 hour chart is trading at our previously predicted  support zone  between 496 and 472. I am now watching Ethereum's movement very carefully within this zone to see if candles can show a reversal so I can be a buyer!  

There's a short term lower horizontal  support zone  between 390 and 364 which will be Ethereums next bounce level if the current  support level  fails. If this support also fails, then we need to reconsider Ethereums intermediate trend before making any buy considerations. 

Bare in mind if we hit the secondary  support zone  at 390 and 364, then price is likely to rise, but only up to the first horizontal  support zone  between 496 and 472, as this level would likely become resistance.  

I will continue to update this analysis if enough people request it.
